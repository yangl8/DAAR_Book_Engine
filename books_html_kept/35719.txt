A MAP of the Country of the
Five Nations
, belonging to
the Province of
New York
; and of the
Lakes
near which the Nations of
Far
Indians
live, with part of
Canada
.

N.B. The Tuscaroras are now reckon'd a sixth Nation, & live between the
Onondagues & Oneidas; & the Necariages of Misilimakinac were received
to be the seventh Nation at Albany, May 30.
th
1723; at their own
desire, 80 Men of that Nation being present besides Women & children.
The chief Trade with the far Indians is at the Onondagues rivers mouth
where they must all pass to go towards Canada.

THE

H I S T O R Y

OF THE

FIVE Indian NATIONS

OF

C A N A D A
,

Which are dependent

On the Province of
New-York
in
America
,

AND

Are the Barrier between the
English
and

French
in that Part of the World.

WITH

Accounts of their Religion, Manners, Customs, Laws, and Forms of
Government; their several Battles and Treaties with the
European

Nations; particular Relations of their several Wars with the other

Indians
; and a true Account of the present State of our Trade with
them.

In which are shewn

The great Advantage of their Trade and Alliance to the
British
Nation,
and the Intrigues and Attempts of the French to engage them from us; a
Subject nearly concerning all our
American
Plantations, and highly
meriting the Consideration of the
British
Nation at this Juncture.

By the Honourable

C a d w a l l a d e r  C o l d e n
,
Esq
;

One of his Majesty's Counsel, and Surveyor-General of
New-York.

To which are added,

Accounts of the several other Nations of
Indians
in
North-America
,
their Numbers, Strength, &c. and the Treaties which have been lately
made with them. A Work highly entertaining to all, and particularly
useful to the Persons who have any Trade or Concern in that Part of
the World.

TO THE HONOURABLE

G E N E R A L

O G L E T H O R P E
.

SIR,

T
he
Indian
Affairs have ever appeared to your judgment of such
Importance to the Welfare of our own People, that you have ever
carefully applied your Thoughts to them; and that with such Success,
that not only the present Generation will enjoy the Benefit of your
Care, but our latest Posterity bless your Memory for that Happiness the
Foundation of which was laid under your Care, provided that the People
here, whose Duty and Interest is chiefly concerned, do on their own
Parts second your Endeavours, towards securing the Peace, and advancing
the Prosperity of their Country.

The following Account of the
Five Indian Nations
will shew what
dangerous Neighbours the
Indians
have once been; what Pains a
neighbouring Colony (whose Interest is opposite to ours) has taken to
withdraw their Affections from us; and how much we ought to be on our
Guard. If we only consider the Riches which our Enemies receive from the

Indian Trade
(though we were under no Apprehensions from the
Indians

themselves) it would be highly imprudent in us to suffer such People to
grow Rich and Powerful, while it is in our Power to prevent it, with
much less Charge and Trouble, than it is in theirs to accomplish their
Designs.

These Considerations alone are sufficient to make the
Indian Affairs

deserve the most serious Thoughts of every Governor in
America
. But I
well know, besides; that your Excellency's views are not confined to the
Interest of one Country only.

The
Five Nations
are a poor and, generally called, barbarous People,
bred under the darkest Ignorance; and yet a bright and noble Genius
shines through these black Clouds. None of the greatest
Roman
Heroes
have discovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Contempt
of Death, than these people called Barbarians have done, when Liberty
came in Competition. Indeed, I think our
Indians
have outdone the

Romans
in this Particular; some of the greatest of those have we know
murdered themselves to avoid Shame or Torments; but our
Indians
have
refused to die meanly, or with but little Pain, when they thought their
Country's Honour would be at stake by it
[1]
; but have given their
Bodies, willingly, to the most cruel Torments of their Enemies, to shew,
as they said, that the
Five Nations
consisted of Men, whose Courage
and Resolution could not be shaken. They greatly sully, however, those
noble virtues, by that cruel Passion, Revenge; this they think is not
only lawful, but honourable, to exert without Mercy on their Country's
Enemies, and for this only it is that they can deserve the Name of
Barbarians.

But what, alas! Sir, have we Christians done to make them better? We
have indeed Reason to be ashamed, that these Infidels, by our
Conversation and Neighbourhood, are become worse than they were before
they knew us. Instead of virtues we have only taught them Vices, that
they were intirely free from before that Time. The narrow Views of
private Interest have occasioned this, and will occasion greater, even
publick Mischiefs, if the Governors of the People do not, like true
Patriots, exert themselves, and put a stop to these growing Evils. If
these Practices be winked at, instead of faithful Friends, that have
manfully fought our Battles for us, the
Five Nations
will become
faithless Thieves and Robbers, and join with every Enemy that can give
them any Hopes of Plunder.

If Care were taken to plant and cultivate in them that general
Benevolence to Mankind, which is the true first Principle of virtue, it
would effectually eradicate those horrid Vices, occasioned by their
unbounded Revenge; and then they would no longer deserve the Name of
Barbarians, but would become a People, whose Friendship might add Honour
to the
British
Nation.

The
Greeks
and
Romans
, Sir, once as much Barbarians as our
Indians

now are, deified the Heroes that first taught them those virtues, from
whence the Grandeur of those renowned Nations wholly proceeded; a good
Man, however, will feel more real Satisfaction and Pleasure, from the
Sense of having any Way forwarded the Civilizing of a barbarous Nation,
or of having multiplied the Number of good Men, than from the fondest
Hopes of such extravagant Honours.

These Considerations, I believe, will induce you, Sir, to think a
History of the
Five Nations
not unworthy of your Patronage; and on
these only it is that I presume to offer my best Endeavours in this, who
am, with the greatest Respect,

S I R
,

Your most obedient
,

and most humble Servant,

Cadwallader Colden.

THE

P R E F A C E

TO THE

F i r s t  P a r t
.

T
hough every one that is in the least acquainted with the Affairs of

North-America,
knows of what Consequence the
Indians,
commonly known to
the People of
New-York
by the Name of the
Five Nations,
are, both in
Peace and War; I know of no Accounts of them, published in
English,
but
what are very imperfect, and indeed meer Translations of
French
Authors,
who themselves know little of the Truth. This seems to throw some
Reflections on the Inhabitants of our Province, as if we wanted
Curiosity to enquire into our own Affairs, and were willing to rest
satisfied with the Accounts the
French
give us of our own
Indians,

notwithstanding that the
French
in
Canada
are always in a different
Interest, and sometimes in open Hostility with us. This Consideration, I
hope, will justify my attempting to write an History of the
Five
Nations
at this Time; and having had the Perusal of the Minutes of the
Commissioners for
Indian Affairs,
I have been enabled to collect many
Materials for this History, which are not to be found any where else;
and cannot but think, that a History of this Kind will be of great Use
to all the British Colonies in
North-America,
since it may enable them
to learn Experience at the Expence of others: And if I can contribute
any Thing to so good a Purpose, I shall not think my Labour lost.

It will be necessary for me here to say something in Excuse of two
Things in the following Performance, which, I am afraid, will naturally
be found Fault with in it. The first is, the filling up so great Part of
the Work with the Adventures of small Parties, and sometimes with those
of one single Man: And the second is, the inserting so many Speeches at
length.

As to the first, the History of
Indians
would be very lame, without an
Account of these private Adventures; for their warlike Expeditions are
almost always carried on by surprising each other, and their whole Art
of War consists in managing small Parties. The whole Country being one
continued Forest, gives great Advantages to those skulking Parties, and
has obliged the Christians to imitate the
Indians
in this Method of
making War among them. And some would, doubtless, be desirous to know
the Manners and Customs of the
Indians,
in their publick Treaties
especially, who could not be satisfied without taking Notice of several
minute Circumstances, and Things otherwise of no Consequence. We are
fond of searching into remote Antiquity, to know the Manners of our
earliest Progenitors; and, if I am not mistaken, the
Indians
are living
Images of them.

My Design therefore in the second was, that thereby the Genius of the

Indians
might appear. An Historian may paint Mens Actions in lively
Colours, or in faint Shades, as he likes best, and in both Cases
preserve a perfect Likeness; but it will be a difficult Task to shew
the Wit, Judgment, Art, Simplicity, and Ignorance of the several
Parties, managing a
Treaty,
in other Words than their own. As to my
Part, I thought myself incapable of doing it, without depriving the
judicious Observer of the Opportunity of discovering much of the
Indian
Genius,
by my contracting or paraphrasing their Harangues, and without
committing often gross Mistakes. For, on these Occasions, a skilful
Manager often talks confusedly, and obscurely, with Design; which if an
Historian should endeavour to amend, the Reader would receive the
History in a false Light.

The Reader will find a great Difference between some of the Speeches
here given of those made at
Albany
, and those taken from the
French
Authors.
Ours are genuine and truly related, as delivered by the sworn
Interpreters, of whom Truth only is required; a rough Stile, with Truth,
is preferable to Eloquence without it: This may be said in Justification
of the
Indian
Expression, though I must own, that I suspect our
Interpreters may not have done Justice to the
Indian
Eloquence. For the

Indians
having but few Words, and few complex Ideas, use many Metaphors
in their Discourse, which interpreted by an unskilful Tongue, may appear
mean, and strike our Imagination faintly; but under the Pen of a skilful
Representer, might strongly move our Passions by their lively Images. I
have heard an old
Indian Sachem
speak with much Vivacity and Elocution,
so that the Speaker pleased and moved the Auditors with the Manner of
delivering his Discourse; which however, as it afterwards came from the
Interpreter, disappointed us in our Expectations. After the Speaker had
employed a considerable Time in haranguing with much Elocution, the
Interpreter often explained the whole by one single Sentence. I believe
the Speaker, in that Time, embellished and adorned his Figures, that
they might have their full Force on the Imagination, while the
Interpreter contented himself with the Sense, in as few Words as it
could be expressed.

He that first writes the History of Things, which are not generally
known, ought to avoid, as much as possible, to make the Evidence of the
Truth depend intirely on his own Veracity and Judgment; and for this
Reason I have related several Transactions in the Words of the
Registers, when this is once done, he that shall write afterwards, need
not act with so much Caution.

The History of these
Indians,
I promise myself, will give an agreeable
Amusement to many; almost every one will find something in it suited to
his own Palate; but every Line will not please every Man; on the
contrary, one will naturally approve what another condemns, as one
desires to know what another thinks not worth the Trouble of reading;
for which Reason, I think, it is better to run the Risque of being
sometimes tedious to certain Readers, than to omit any Thing that may be
useful to the World.

I have sometimes thought, that Histories wrote with all the Delicacy of
a fine Romance, are like
French
Dishes, more agreeable to the Palate
than the Stomach, and less wholesome than more common and coarser Diet.

An Historian's Views must be curious and extensive, and the History of
different People and different Ages requires different Rules, and often
different Abilities to write it; I hope therefore the Reader will, from
those Considerations, receive this first Attempt of this kind, with more
than usual Allowances.

The Inhabitants of
New-York
have been much more concerned in the
Transactions, which followed the Year
1688,
than in those which preceded
it. And as it requires uncommon Courage and Resolution to engage
willingly in the Wars against a cruel and barbarous Enemy, I should be
sorry to forget any that might deserve to be remembered by their
Country, with Gratitude on that Occasion.

THE

I N T R O D U C T I O N,

BEING

A short View of the Form of Government of the
Five Nations,
and of
their Laws, Customs
, &c.

I
t is necessary to know something of the Form of Government of the
People, whose History one is about to know, and a few Words will be
sufficient to give the Reader a Conception of that of the
Five
Nations
, because it still remains under original Simplicity, and free
from those complicated Contrivances, which have become necessary to the
Nations, where Deceit and Cunning have increased as much as their
Knowledge and Wisdom.

The
Five Nations
(as their Name denotes) consist of so many Tribes or
Nations, joined together by a League or Confederacy, like the
United
Provinces
, and without any Superiority of the one over the other. This
Union has continued so long, that the Christians know nothing of the
Original of it: The People in it are known by the
English
under the
Names of
Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onondagas, Cayugas,
and
Sennekas.

Each of these Nations is again divided into three Tribes or Families,
who distinguish themselves by three different Arms or Ensigns, the

Tortoise
, the
Bear
, and the
Wolf
; and the
Sachems
, or old Men of
these Families, put this Ensign, or Mark of their Family, to every
publick Paper, when they sign it.

Each of these Nations is an absolute Republick by itself, and every
Castle in each Nation makes an independent Republick, and is govern'd in
all publick Affairs by its own
Sachems
or old Men. The Authority of
these Rulers is gain'd by, and consists wholly in the Opinion the rest
of the Nation have of their Wisdom and Integrity. They never execute
their Resolutions by Force upon any of their People. Honour and Esteem
are their principal Rewards; as Shame, and being despised, their
Punishments. They have certain Customs, which they observe in their
publick Transactions with other Nations, and in their private Affairs
among themselves; which it is scandalous for any one among them not to
observe, and these always draw after them either publick or private
Resentment, whenever they are broke.

Their Leaders and Captains, in like Manner, obtain their Authority, by
the general Opinion of their Courage and Conduct, and lose it by a
failure in those Virtues.

Their great Men, both Sachems and Captains, are generally poorer than
the common People; for they affect to give away and distribute all the
Presents or Plunder they get in their Treaties or in War, so as to leave
nothing to themselves. There is not a Man in the Ministry of the
Five
Nations
, who has gain'd his Office, otherwise than by Merit; there is
not the least Salary, or any Sort of Profit, annexed to any Office, to
tempt the Covetous or Sordid; but, on the contrary, every unworthy
Action is unavoidably attended with the Forfeiture of their Commission;
for their Authority is only the Esteem of the People, and ceases the
Moment that Esteem is lost. Here we see the natural Origin of all Power
and Authority among a free People, and whatever artificial Power or
Sovereignty any Man may have acquired, by the Laws and Constitution of a
Country, his real Power will be ever much greater or less, in Proportion
to the Esteem the People have of him.

The
Five Nations
think themselves by Nature superior to the rest of
Mankind, and call themselves
Ongue-honwe
; that is, Men surpassing all
others. This Opinion, which they take Care to cultivate into their
Children, gives them that Courage, which has been so terrible to all the
Nations of
North America
; and they have taken such Care to impress the
same Opinion of their People on all their Neighbours, that they, on all
Occasions, yield the most submissive Obedience to them. I have been told
by old Men in
New England
, who remembered the Time when the
Mohawks

made War on their
Indians
, that as soon as a single
Mohawk
was
discover'd in the Country, their
Indians
raised a Cry from Hill to
Hill,
A Mohawk! A Mohawk!
upon which they all fled like Sheep before
Wolves, without attempting to make the least Resistance, whatever Odds
were on their Side. The poor
New England Indians
immediately ran to
the Christian Houses, and the
Mohawks
often pursued them so closely,
that they entered along with them, and knocked their Brains out in the
Presence of the People of the House; but if the Family had Time to shut
the Door, they never attempted to force it, and on no Occasion did any
Injury to the Christians. All the Nations round them have, for many
Years, intirely submitted to them, and pay a yearly Tribute to them in

Wampum
[2]
; they dare neither make War nor Peace, without the Consent
of the
Mohawks
. Two old Men commonly go about every Year or two, to
receive this Tribute; and I have often had Opportunity to observe what
Anxiety the poor
Indians
were under, while these two old Men remained
in that Part of the Country where I was. An old
Mohawk Sachem
, in a
poor Blanket and a dirty Shirt, may be seen issuing his Orders with as
arbitrary an Authority, as a
Roman
Dictator. It is not for the Sake of
Tribute however, that they make War, but from the Notions of Glory,
which they have ever most strongly imprinted on their Minds; and the
farther they go to seek an Enemy, the greater Glory they think they
gain; there cannot, I think, be a greater or stronger Instance than
this, how much the Sentiments, impressed upon a People's Mind, conduce
to their Grandeur, or one that more verifies a Saying often to be met
with, though but too little minded, That it is in the Power of the
Rulers of a People to make them either Great or Little; for by
inculcating only the Notions of Honour and Virtue, or those of Luxury
and Riches, the People, in a little Time, will become such as their
Rulers desire. The
Five Nations
, in their Love of Liberty, and of
their Country, in their Bravery in Battle, and their Constancy in
enduring Torments, equal the Fortitude of the most renowned
Romans
. I
shall finish their general Character by what an Enemy, a
Frenchman
,
says of them,
Monsieur De la Poterie
, in his History of
North
America
.

"When we speak (says he) of the
Five Nations
in
France
, they are
thought, by a common Mistake, to be mere Barbarians, always thirsting
after human Blood; but their true Character is very different. They are
indeed the fiercest and most formidable People in
North America
, and,
at the same Time, are as politick and judicious, as well can be
conceived; and this appears from the Management of all the Affairs which
they transact, not only with the
French
and
English
, but likewise
with almost all the
Indian
Nations of this vast Continent."

Their Matters of Consequence, which concern all the Nations, are
transacted in a general Meeting of the
Sachems
of each Nation. These
Conventions are commonly held at
Onnondaga
, which is nearly the Center
of their Country; but they have fixed on
Albany
for the Place of
treating with the
British Colonies
.

They strictly follow one Maxim, formerly used by the
Romans
to
increase their Strength, that is, they encourage the People of other
Nations to incorporate with them; and when they have subdued any People,
after they have satiated their Revenge by some cruel Examples, they
adopt the rest of their Captives; who, if they behave well, become
equally esteemed with their own People; so that some of their Captives
have afterwards become their greatest
Sachems
and
Captains
. The

Tuskaroras
, after the War they had with the People of
Carolina
, fled
to the
Five Nations
, and are now incorporated with them; so that they
now properly indeed consist of six Nations, though they still retain the
old Name of the
Five Nations
among the
English
. The
Cowetas
also,
or
Creek-Indians
, are in the same Friendship with them.

The
Tuskaroras
, since they came under the Province of
New York
,
behave themselves well, and remain peaceable and quiet; and by this may
be seen the Advantage of using the
Indians
well, and I believe, if
they were still better used (as there is Room enough to do it) they
would be proportionably more useful to us.

The Cruelty the
Indians
use in their Wars, towards those that do not
or cannot resist, such as Women and Children, and to their Prisoners,
after they have them in their Power, is deservedly indeed held in
Abhorrence: But whoever reads the History of the so famed ancient
Heroes, will find them, I'm afraid, not much better in this Respect.
Does
Achilles
's Behaviour to
Hector
's dead Body, in
Homer
, appear
less savage? This Cruelty is also not peculiar to the
Five Nations
,
but equally practised by all other
Indians
. It is wonderful, how
Custom and Education are able to soften the most horrid Actions, even
among a polite and learned People; witness the
Carthaginians
and

Phoenicians
burning their own Children alive in Sacrifice; and several
Passages in the
Jewish History
; and witness, in later Times, the
Christians burning one another alive, for God's Sake.

When any of the young Men of these Nations have a Mind to signalize
themselves, and to gain a Reputation among their Countrymen, by some
notable Enterprize against their Enemy, they at first communicate their
Design to two or three of their most intimate Friends; and if they come
into it, an Invitation is made, in their Names, to all the young Men of
the Castle, to feast on Dog's Flesh; but whether this be, because Dog's
Flesh is most agreeable to
Indian
Palates, or whether it be as an
Emblem of Fidelity, for which the Dog is distinguished by all Nations,
that it is always used on this Occasion, I have not sufficient
Information to determine. When the Company is met, the Promoters of the
Enterprize set forth the Undertaking in the best Colours they can; they
boast of what they intend to do, and incite others to join, from the
Glory there is to be obtained; and all who eat of the Dog's Flesh,
thereby inlist themselves.

The Night before they set out, they make a grand Feast, to this all the
noted Warriors of the Nation are invited; and here they have their War
Dance, to the Beat of a Kind of a Kettle-drum. The Warriors are seated
in two Rows in the House, and each rises up in his Turn, and sings the
great Acts he has himself performed, and the Deeds of his Ancestors;
and this is always accompanied with a Kind of a Dance, or rather
Action, representing the Manner in which they were performed; and from
Time to Time, all present join in a Chorus, applauding every notable
Act. They exaggerate the Injuries they have at any Time received from
their Enemies, and extol the Glory which any of their Ancestors have
gained by their Bravery and Courage; so that they work up their spirits
to a high Degree of warlike Enthusiasm. I have sometimes persuaded some
of their young
Indians
to act these Dances, for our Diversion, and to
shew us the Manner of them; and even, on these Occasions, they have
work'd themselves up to such a Pitch, that they have made all present
uneasy. Is it not probable, that such Designs as these have given the
first Rise to Tragedy?

They come to these Dances with their Faces painted in a frightful
Manner, as they always are when they go to War, to make themselves
terrible to their Enemies; and in this Manner the Night is spent. Next
Day they march out with much Formality, dressed in their finest Apparel,
and, in their March, observe a profound Silence. An Officer of the
regular Troops told me, that while he was Commandant of
Fort-Hunter
,
the
Mohawks
, on one of these Occasions, told him, that they expected
the usual military Honours as they passed the Garison. Accordingly he
drew out his Garison, the Men presented their Pieces as the
Indians

passed, and the Drum beat a March; and with less Respect, the Officer
said, they would have been dissatisfied. The
Indians
passed in a
single Row, one after another, with great Gravity and profound Silence;
and every one of them, as he passed the Officer, took his Gun from his
Shoulder, and fired into the Ground near the Officer's Foot: They
marched in this Manner three or four Miles from their Castle. The Women,
on these Occasions, always follow them with their old Clothes, and they
send back by them their Finery in which they marched from the Castle.
But before they go from this Place, where they exchange their Clothes,
they always peel a large Piece of the Bark from some great Tree; they
commonly chuse an Oak, as most lasting; upon the smooth Side of this
Wood they, with their red Paint, draw one or more Canoes, going from
Home, with the Number of Men in them padling, which go upon the
Expedition; and some Animal, as a Deer or Fox, an Emblem of the Nation
against which the Expedition is designed, is painted at the Head of the
Canoes; for they always travel in Canoes along the Rivers, which lead to
the Country against which the Expedition is designed, as far as they
can.

After the Expedition is over, they stop at the same Place in their
Return, and send to their Castle, to inform their Friends of their
Arrival; that they may be prepared to give them a solemn Reception,
suited to the Success they have had. In the mean Time, they represent on
the same, or some Tree near it, the Event of the Enterprize, and now the
Canoes are painted with their Heads turned towards the Castle; the
Number of the Enemy killed, is represented by Scalps painted black, and
the Number of Prisoners by as many Withs, (in their Painting not unlike
Pothooks) with which they usually pinion their Captives. These Trees are
the Annals, or rather Trophies of the
Five Nations
: I have seen many
of them; and by them, and their War Songs, they preserve the History of
their great Achievements. The solemn Reception of these Warriors, and
the Acclamations of Applause, which they receive at their Return, cannot
but have in the Hearers the same Effect, in raising an Emulation for
Glory, that a Triumph had on the old
Romans
.

After their Prisoners are secured, they never offer them the least
Male-treatment, but, on the contrary, will rather starve themselves,
than suffer them to want; and I have been always assured, that there is
not one Instance, of their offering the least Violence to the Chastity
of any Woman that was their Captive. But notwithstanding this, the poor
Prisoners afterwards undergo severe Punishments before they receive the
last Doom of Life or Death. The Warriors think it for their Glory, to
lead them through all the Villages of the Nations subject to them, which
lie near the Road; and these, to shew their Affection to the
Five
Nations
, and their Abhorrence of their Enemies, draw up in two Lines,
through which the poor Prisoners, stark naked, must run the Gauntlet;
and on this Occasion, it is always observed, the Women are much more
cruel than the Men. The Prisoners meet with the same sad Reception when
they reach their Journey's End; and after this, they are presented to
those that have lost any Relation in that or any former Enterprize. If
the Captives be accepted, there is an End to their Sorrow from that
Moment; they are dressed as fine as they can make them; they are
absolutely free (except to return to their own Country) and enjoy all
the Privileges the Person had, in whose Place they are accepted; but if
otherwise they die in Torments, to satiate the Revenge of those that
refuse them.

If a young Man or Boy be received in Place of a Husband that was killed,
all the Children of the Deceased call that Boy Father; so that one may
sometimes hear a Man of thirty say, that such a Boy of fifteen or twenty
is his Father.

Their Castles are generally a Square surrounded with Palisadoes, without
any Bastions or Out-works; for, since the general Peace, their Villages
lie all open.

Their only Instruments of War are Musquets, Hatchets, and long sharp
pointed Knives; these they always carry about with them: Their Hatchet,
in War-time, is stuck in their Girdle behind them; and besides what Use
they make of this Weapon in their Hand, they have a dexterous Way of
throwing it, which I have seen them often practise in their Exercise,
by throwing it into a Tree at a Distance: They have, in this, the Art of
directing and regulating the Motion, so that though the Hatchet turns
round as it flies, the Edge always sticks in the Tree, and near the
Place at which they aim it. The Use of Bows and Arrows are now intirely
laid aside, except among the Boys, who are still very dexterous in
killing Fowls and other Animals with them.

They use neither Drum nor
Trumpet, nor any Kind of musical Instrument in their Wars; their Throats
serve them on all Occasions, where such are necessary. Many of them have
a surprising Faculty of raising their Voice, not only in inarticulate
Sounds, but likewise to make their Words understood at a great Distance;
and we find the same was practised by
Homer
's Heroes,

Thrice to its Pitch his lofty Voice he rears,——

O Friend!
Ulysses
Shouts invade my Ears.

The
Five Nations
have such absolute Notions of Liberty, that they
allow of no Kind of Superiority of one over another, and banish all
Servitude from their Territories. They never make any Prisoner a Slave;
but it is customary among them to make a Compliment of Naturalization
into the
Five Nations
; and, considering how highly they value
themselves above all others, this must be no small Compliment. This is
not done by any general Act of the Nation, but every single Person has a
Right to do it, by a Kind of Adoption. The first Time I was among the

Mohawks
, I had this Compliment from one of their old
Sachems
, which
he did, by giving me his own Name,
Cayenderongue
. He had been a
notable Warrior; and he told me, that now I had a Right to assume to
myself all the Acts of Valour he had performed, and that now my Name
would echo from Hill to Hill all over the
Five Nations
. As for my
Part, I thought no more of it at that Time, than as an Artifice to draw
a Belly full of strong Liquor from me, for himself and his Companions;
but when about ten or twelve Years afterwards, my Business led me again
among them, I directed the Interpreter to say something from me to the

Sachems
; he was for some Time at a Loss to understand their Answer,
till he had asked me whether I had any Name among them: I then found
that I was really known to them by that Name, and that the old
Sachem
,
from the Time he had given me his Name, had assumed another to himself.
I was adopted, at that Time, into the Tribe of the
Bear
, and, for that
Reason, I often afterwards had the kind Compliment of
Brother Bear
.

The Hospitality of these
Indians
is no less remarkable, than their
other Virtues; as soon as any Stranger comes, they are sure to offer him
Victuals. If there be several in Company, and come from a-far, one of
their best Houses is cleaned and given up for their Entertainment. Their
Complaisance, on these Occasions, goes even farther than Christian
Civility allows of, as they have no other Rule for it, than the
furnishing their Guest with every Thing they think will be agreeable to
him; for this Reason, some of their prettiest Girls are always ordered
to wash themselves, and dress in their best Apparel, in Order to be
presented to the Stranger, for his Choice; and the young Lady, who has
the Honour to be preferred on these Occasions, performs all the Duties
of a fond Wife, during the Stranger's Stay: But this last Piece of
Hospitality is now either laid aside by the
Mohawks
, or, at least,
they never offer it to any Christian. This Nation indeed has laid aside
many of its ancient Customs, and so likewise have the other Nations,
with whom we are best acquainted; and have adopted many of ours; so that
it is not easy now to distinguish their original and genuine Manners,
from those which they have lately acquired; and for this Reason it is,
that they now seldom offer Victuals to Persons of any Distinction,
because they know, that their Food and Cookery is not agreeable to our
delicate Palates. Their Men value themselves, in having all Kind of Food
in equal Esteem. A
Mohawk Sachem
told me with a Kind of Pride, That a
Man eats every Thing without Distinction,
Bears, Cats, Dogs, Snakes,
Frogs
, &c. intimating, that it is Womanish, to have any Delicacy in the
Choice of Food.

I can however give two strong Instances of the Hospitality of the

Mohawks
, which fell under my own Observation; and which shew, that
they have the very same Notion of Hospitality, which we find in the
ancient Poets. When I was last in the
Mohawks
Country, the
Sachems

told me, that they had an
Englishman
among their People, a Servant who
had run from his Master in
New York
. I immediately told them, that
they must deliver him up. No, they answered, we never serve any Man so,
who puts himself under our Protection. On this I insisted on the Injury
they did thereby to his Master; and they allowed it might be an Injury,
and replied, though we never will deliver him up, we are willing to pay
the Value of the Servant to the Master. Another Man made his Escape from
the Goal of
Albany
, where he was in Prison on an Execution for Debt;
the
Mohawks
received him, and, as they protected him against the
Sheriff and his Officers, they not only paid the Debt for him, but gave
him Land, over and above sufficient for a good Farm, whereon he lived
when I was last there. To this it may be added, all their extraordinary
Visits are accompanied with giving and receiving Presents of some Value;
as we learn likewise from
Homer
was the Practice in old Times.

Polygamy
is not usual among them; and indeed, in any Nation, where all
are on a Par, as to Riches and Power, Plurality of Wives cannot well be
introduced. As all Kind of Slavery is banished from the Countries of the

Five Nations
, so they keep themselves free also from the Bondage of
Wedlock; and when either of the Parties becomes disgusted, they separate
without Formality or Ignominy to either, unless it be occasioned by some
scandalous Offence in one of them. And in Case of Divorce, the Children,
according to the natural Course of all Animals, follow the Mother. The
Women here bring forth their Children with as much Ease as other
Animals, and without the Help of a Midwife, and, soon after their
Delivery, return to their usual Employment. They alone also perform all
the Drudgery about their Houses, they plant their Corn, and labour it,
in every Respect, till it is brought to the Table: They likewise cut all
their Fire-wood, and bring it Home on their Backs, and in their Marches
bear the Burdens. The Men disdain all Kind of Labour, and employ
themselves alone in Hunting, as the only proper Business for Soldiers.
At Times, when it is not proper to hunt, one finds the
old Men
in
Companies, in Conversation; the young Men at their Exercises, shooting
at Marks, throwing the Hatchet, Wrestling, or Running, and the Women all
busy at Labour in the Fields.

On these Occasions, the State of
Lacedæmon
ever occurs to my Mind,
which that of the
Five Nations
, in many Respects, resembles; their
Laws, or Customs, being, in both, form'd to render the Minds and Bodies
of the People fit for War.

Theft is very scandalous among them; and it is necessary it should be so
among all
Indians
, since they have no Locks, but those of their Minds,
to preserve their Goods.

There is one Vice which the
Indians
have all fallen into, since their
Acquaintance with the
Christians
, and of which they could not be
guilty before that Time, that is, Drunkenness: It is strange, how all
the
Indian
Nations, and almost every Person among them, Male and
Female, are infatuated with the Love of strong Drink; they know no
Bounds to their Desire, while they can swallow it down, and then indeed
the greatest Man among them scarcely deserves the Name of a Brute.

They never have been taught to conquer any Passion, but by some contrary
Passion; and the Traders, with whom they chiefly converse, are so far
from giving them any Abhorrence of this Vice, that they encourage it all
they can, not only for the Profit of the Liquor they sell, but that they
may have an Opportunity to impose upon them. And this, as they chiefly
drink Spirits, has destroyed greater Numbers, than all their Wars and
Diseases put together.

The People of the
Five Nations
are much given to
Speech-making
, ever
the natural Consequence of a perfect Republican Government: Where no
single Person has a Power to compel, the Arts of Persuasion alone must
prevail. As their best Speakers distinguish themselves in their publick
Councils and Treaties with other Nations, and thereby gain the Esteem
and Applause of their Countrymen, (the only Superiority which any one of
them has over the others) it is probable they apply themselves to this
Art, by some Kind of Study and Exercise, in a great Measure. It is
impossible for me to judge how far they excel, as I am ignorant of their
Language; but the Speakers whom I have heard, had all a great Fluency of
Words, and much more Grace in their Manner, than any Man could expect,
among a People intirely ignorant of all the liberal Arts and Sciences.

I am inform'd, that they are very nice in the Turn of their Expressions,
and that few of themselves are so far Masters of their Language, as
never to offend the Ears of their
Indian
Auditory, by an unpolite
Expression. They have, it seems, a certain
Urbanitas
, or
Atticism
,
in their Language, of which the common Ears are ever sensible, though
only their great Speakers attain to it. They are so much given to
Speech-making, that their common Complements, to any Person they
respect, at meeting and parting, are made in Harangues.

They have some Kind of Elegancy in varying and compounding their Words,
to which, not many of themselves attain, and this principally
distinguishes their best Speakers. I have endeavoured to get some
Account of this, as a Thing that might be acceptable to the Curious;
but, as I have not met with any one Person who understands their
Language, and also knows any Thing of Grammar, or of the learned
Languages, I have not been able to attain the least Satisfaction. Their
present Minister tells me, that their Verbs are varied, but in a Manner
so different from the
Greek
or
Latin
, that he cannot discover by
what Rule it was done; and even suspects, that every Verb has a peculiar
Mode: They have but few radical Words, but they compound their Words
without End; by this their Language becomes sufficiently copious, and
leaves Room for a good Deal of Art to please a delicate Ear. Sometimes
one Word among them includes an entire Definition of the Thing; for
Example, they call
Wine Oneharadeseboengtseragberie
, as much as to
say, a
Liquor made of the Juice of the Grape
. The Words expressing
Things lately come to their Knowledge are all Compounds: They have no
Labeals in their Language, nor can they pronounce perfectly any Word
wherein there is a Labeal; and when one endeavours to teach them to
pronounce these Words, they tell one, they think it ridiculous that they
must shut their Lips to speak. Their Language abounds with Gutturals and
strong Aspirations, these make it very sonorous and bold; and their
Speeches abound with Metaphors, after the Manner of the Eastern Nations,
as will best appear by the Speeches that I have copied.

As to what
religious Notions
they have, it is difficult to judge of
them; because the
Indians
, that speak any
English
, and live near us,
have learned many Things of us; and it is not easy to distinguish the
Notions they had originally among themselves, from those they have
learned of the
Christians
. It is certain they have no Kind of publick
Worship, and I am told that they have no radical Word to express
God
,
but use a compound Word, signifying the Preserver, Sustainer, or Master
of the Universe; neither could I ever learn what Sentiments they have of
a future Existence. Their funeral Rites seem to be formed upon a Notion
of some Kind of Existence after Death: They make a large round Hole, in
which the Body can be placed upright, or upon its Haunches, which after
the Body is placed in it, is covered with Timber, to support the Earth
which they lay over, and thereby keep the Body free from being pressed;
they then raise the Earth in a round Hill over it. They always dress the
Corps in all its Finery, and put Wampum and other Things into the Grave
with it; and the Relations suffer not Grass or any Weed to grow on the
Grave, and frequently visit it with Lamentations: But whether these
Things be done only as Marks of Respect to the Deceased, or from a
Notion of some Kind of Existence after Death, must be left to the
Judgment of the Reader.

They are very superstitious in observing Omens and Dreams; I have
observed them shew a superstitious Awe of the Owl, and be highly
displeased with some that mimicked the Cry of that Bird in the Night. An
Officer of the regular Troops has informed me also, that while he had
the Command of the Garrison at
Oswego
, a Boy of one of the far
Westward Nations died there; the Parents made a regular Pile of split
Wood, laid the Corps upon it, and burnt it; while the Pile was burning,
they stood gravely looking on, without any Lamentation, but when it was
burnt down, they gathered up the Bones with many Tears, put them into a
Box, and carried them away with them; and this Inclination, which all
ignorant People have to Superstition and amusing Ceremonies, gives the
Popish Priests a great Advantage in recommending their Religion, beyond
what the Regularity of the Protestant Doctrine allows of.

Queen
Anne
sent over a Missionary to reside among the
Mohawks
, and
allowed him a sufficient Subsistence from the privy Purse; she sent
Furniture for a Chappel, and a valuable set of Plate for the Communion
Table; and (if I am not mistaken) the like Furniture and Plate for each
of the other Nations, though that of the
Mohawks
was only applied to
the Use designed. The common Prayer, or at least a considerable Part of
it, was translated also into their Language and printed; some other
Pieces were likewise translated for the Minister's Use,
viz
. An
Exposition of the Creed, Decalogue, Lord's Prayer, and Church Catechism,
and a Discourse on the Sacraments. But as that Minister was never able
to attain any tolerable Knowledge of their Language, and was naturally a
heavy Man, he had but small Success; and his Allowance failing, by the
Queen's Death, he left them. These Nations had no Teacher, from that
Time, till within these few Years, that a young Gentleman, out of pious
Zeal, went voluntarily among the
Mohawks
. He was at first intirely
ignorant of their Language, and had no Interpreter, except one of the

Indians
, who understood a little
English
, and had, in the late
Missionary's Time, learn'd to read and write in his own Language. He
learned from him how to pronounce the Words in the Translations, which
had been made for the late Missionary's Use. He set up a School, to
teach their Children to read and write their own Language; and they made
surprizing Proficiency, considering their Master did not understand
their Language. I happened to be in the
Mohawk
Country, and saw
several of their Performances; I was present at their Worship, where
they went through some Part of the Common Prayer with great Decency. I
was likewise present, several Times, at their private Devotions, which
some of them performed duly, Morning and Evening. I had also many
Opportunities of observing the great Regard they had for this young Man;
so far, that the Fear of his leaving them made the greatest Restraint on
them, with which he threatened them, after they had been guilty of any
Offence. Soon after that Time, this Gentleman went to
England
,
received Orders, and was sent by the Society, Missionary to
Albany
,
with Liberty to spend some Part of his Time among the
Mohawks
.

I had lately a Letter from him, dated the seventh of
December
, 1641,
in which he writes as follows:

"Drunkenness was so common among them, that I doubt, whether
there was one grown Person of either Sex free from it; seldom a
Day passed, without some, and very often forty or fifty being
drunk at a Time. But I found they were very fond of keeping me
among them, and afraid I should leave them, which I made Use of
to good Purpose; daily threatning them with my Departure, in
Case they did not forsake that Vice, and frequently requiring a
particular Promise from them singly; by which Means (through
God's Blessing) there was a gradual Reformation; and I know not
that I have seen above ten or twelve Persons drunk among them
this Summer. The Women are almost all entirely reformed, and the
Men very much. They have intirely left off Divorces, and are
legally married. They are very constant and devout at church and
Family Devotions. They have not been known to exercise Cruelty
to Prisoners, and have, in a great Measure, left off going a
fighting, which I find the most difficult, of all Things, to
dissuade them from. They seem also persuaded of the Truths of
Christianity. The greatest Inconveniency I labour under, is the
Want of an Interpreter, which could I obtain, for two or three
Years, I should hope to be tolerably Master of their Language,
and be able to render it easier to my Successor."

This Gentleman's uncommon Zeal deserves, I think, this publick
Testimony, that it may be a Means of his receiving such Encouragement,
as may enable him to pursue the pious Purposes he has in View.

The
Mohawks
, were they civilized, may be useful to us many Ways, and,
on many Occasions, more than any of our own People can be; and this well
deserves to be considered.

There is one Custom their Men constantly observe, which I must not
forget to mention; That if they be sent with any Message, though it
demand the greatest Dispatch, or though they bring Intelligence of any
imminent Danger, they never tell it at their first Approach; but sit
down for a Minute or two, at least, in Silence, to recollect themselves,
before they speak, that they may not shew any Degree of Fear or
Surprize, by an indecent Expression. Every sudden Repartee, in a publick
Treaty, leaves with them an Impression of a light inconsiderate Mind;
but, in private Conversation, they use, and are delighted with brisk
witty Answers, as we can be. By this they shew the great Difference they
place between the Conversations of Man and Man, and of Nation and
Nation; and in this, and a thousand other Things, might well be an
Example to the
European
Nations.

PART I.

The History of the
Five Nations,
from the Time the Christians first
knew any Thing of them, to that of the Revolution in
Great-Britain.

CHAP. I.

Of the Wars of the
Five Nations
with the
Adirondacks
and

Quatoghies.

T
he first Settlers of
New-York
having been little curious in inquiring
into the
Indian Affairs
, further than what related to Trade; or, at
least, having neglected to transmit their Discoveries to Posterity, it
is much more difficult to give a just History of these Nations before,
than since the Time of their being under the
Crown of England
. What we
can learn of Certainty, however, is this. The
French
settled at

Canada
in the Year 1603, six Years before the
Dutch
possessed
themselves of
New-Netherlands
, now called
New-York
, and found the

Five Nations
at War with the
Adirondacks
, which, they tell us, was
occasioned in the following Manner.

The
Adirondacks
formerly lived three-hundred Miles above
Trois
Rivieres
, where now the
Utawawas
are situated; at that Time they
employ'd themselves wholly in Hunting, and the
Five Nations
made
planting of Corn their Business. By this Means they became useful to
each other, by exchanging Corn for Venison. The
Adirondacks
, however,
valued themselves, as delighting in a more manly Employment, and
despised the
Five Nations
, in following Business, which they thought
only fit for Women. But it once happened, that the Game failed the

Adirondacks
, which made them desire some of the young Men of the
Five
Nations
to assist them in Hunting. These young Men soon became much
more expert in Hunting, and able to endure Fatigues, than the

Adirondacks
expected or desired; in short, they became jealous of
them, and, one Night, murdered all the young Men they had with them. The

Five Nations
complained to the Chiefs of the
Adirondacks
, of the
Inhumanity of this Action; but they contented themselves with blaming
the Murderers, and ordered them to make some small
[3]
Presents to the
Relations of the murdered Persons, without being apprehensive of the
Resentment of the
Five Nations
; for they looked upon them, as Men not
capable of taking any great Revenge.

This however provoked the
Five Nations
to that Degree, that they soon
resolved, by some Means, to be revenged; and the
Adirondacks
being
informed of their Designs, thought to prevent them, by reducing them
with Force to their Obedience.

The
Five Nations
then lived near where
Mont Real
now stands; they
defended themselves at first but faintly against the vigorous Attacks of
the
Adirondacks
, and were forced to leave their own Country, and fly
to the Banks of the Lakes where they live now. As they were hitherto
Losers by the War, it obliged them to apply themselves to the Exercise
of Arms, in which they became daily more and more expert. Their

Sachems
, in order to raise their People's Spirits, turned them against
the
Satanas
[4]
, a less warlike Nation, who then lived on the Banks of
the Lakes; for they found it was difficult to remove the Dread their
People had of the Valour of the
Adirondacks
. The
Five Nations
soon
subdued the
Satanas
, and drove them out of their Country; and their
People's Courage being thus elevated, they, from this Time, not only
defended themselves bravely against the whole Force of the

Adirondacks
, but often carried the War into the Heart of the

Adirondacks
's Country, and, at last, forced them to leave it, and to
fly into that Part of the Country, where
Quebeck
is now built.

There are more Instances than one in History, of poor dispirited
Nations, that by some signal Affront or Abuse have had their Spirits so
raised, that they have not only performed notable Things on a sudden,
but, if they happened, at the same Time, to be led and governed by wise
Men, have so far kept up, and improved that Spirit, that they have
become, in a Manner, a different People. Let us examine History, and we
shall find, that the different Figure every Country has made in the
World, has been ever principally owing to the Principles which were
inculcated into, and carefully cultivated in the People. In this chiefly
consists the Art of making a Nation glorious, or the Crime of debasing
them into Servitude or Slavery. It was from the Notions of Liberty,
Honour, and Glory, and such wise and generous Principles, which the
meanest Citizen among the old
Romans
entertained, that they became so
great and powerful, and a Terror to all Nations; as the sordid,
timorous, cunning Artifices, and the Love of Wealth and sensual
Pleasures, cultivated among the present
Romans
, has debased them now
into the meanest and least feared Nation on the Earth. The History of
the
Five Nations
will readily shew, how far the ancient
Roman

Principles have been cultivated among them.

Soon after this Change of the People of these Nations, the
French

arrived at
Canada
, and settled at
Quebeck
; and they thinking it
adviseable to gain the Esteem and Friendship of the
Adirondacks
, in
whose Country they settled,
Monsieur Champlain
, the first Governor of

Canada
, joined the
Adirondacks
in an Expedition against the
Five
Nations
. They met a Party of two-hundred Men of the
Five Nations
in

Corlar's Lake
, which the
French
, on this Occasion called by

Monsieur Champlain's
Name, and both Sides went ashore to prepare for
Battle, which proved to the Disadvantage of the
Five Nations
. The

French
, in short, kept themselves undiscover'd, till the Moment they
began to join Battle; and their Fire-arms surprised the
Five Nations

so much, that they were immediately put into Confusion; for, before that
Time, they had never seen such Weapons. The Trade with the
French
,
soon after this, drew most of the neighbouring Nations to
Quebeck
, and
they all joined in the War against the
Five Nations
.

The
Adirondacks
having their Numbers thus increased, and their
Fire-arms giving them new Confidence, proposed nothing less to
themselves, than the intire Destruction of the
Five Nations
. Upon
this, their young Warriors became fierce and insolent, and would not be
kept under any Discipline or Subjection to their Captains; but, upon all
Occasions, rashly attacked the Enemy, who were obliged to keep
themselves upon the defensive; and to make up what they wanted in Force,
by Stratagems, and a skilful Management of the War. The young Men of the

Five Nations
soon perceived the Advantages they gained by this
Conduct, and every Day grew more submissive to their Captains, and
diligent in executing any Enterprize.

The
Five Nations
sent out small Parties only, who meeting with great
Numbers of the
Adirondacks
, retired before them with seeming Terror,
while the
Adirondacks
pursued them with Fury, and without Thought,
till they were cunningly drawn into Ambuscades, where most of their Men
were killed or taken Prisoners, with little or no Loss to the
Five
Nations
.

The
Adirondacks
, by this Means, wasted away, and their boldest
Soldiers were almost intirely destroy'd, while the Number of the
Five
Nations
were increased, by the Addition of the Prisoners, which they
took from the
Satanas
.

The wisest and best Soldiers of the
Adirondacks
, when it was too late,
now at length discovered, that they must learn the Art of War from those
Enemies that they at first despised; and now five of their Captains
endeavoured to perform by themselves singly, with Art and by Stratagem,
what they could not do by Force at the Head of their Armies; they had
however no longer any Hopes of conquering, their Thoughts were only set
on Revenge.

It is not improper to observe here, once for all, that in writing the
History of
Indians
, it is often necessary to give an Account of the
Enterprizes of single Persons, otherwise the
Indian
Genius can never
be known, or their Manner of making War understood. An
Indian
named

Piskaret
was at this Time one of the Captains of greatest Fame among
the
Adirondacks:
This bold Man, with four other Captains, set out for

Trois-Rivieres
in one Canoe, each of them being provided with three
Musquets, which they loaded with two Bullets apiece, joined with a small
Chain ten Inches long; they met with five Canoes in
Sorel River
, each
having ten Men of the
Five Nations
on Board.
Piskaret
and his
Captains, as soon as those of the
Five Nations
drew near, pretended to
give themselves up for lost, and sung their Death Song,
[5]
then suddenly
fired upon the Canoes, which they repeated with the Arms that lay ready
loaded, and tore those Birch Vessels betwixt Wind and Water. The Men of
the
Five Nations
were so surprized, that they tumbled out of their
Canoes, and gave
Piskaret
and his Companions the Opportunity of
knocking as many of them on the Head as they pleased, and saving the
others, to feed their Revenge, which they did, by burning them alive
with the most cruel Torments. This however was so far from glutting

Piskaret
's Revenge, that it seemed rather to give a keener Edge to it;
for he soon after undertook another Enterprize, in which none of his
Countrymen durst accompany him: He was well acquainted with the Country
of the
Five Nations
, and set out about the Time the Snow began to
melt, with the Precaution of putting the hinder Part of his Snow Shoes
forward, that if any should happen upon his Footsteps, they might think
he was gone the contrary Way; and, for further Security, went along the
Ridges and high Grounds, where the Snow was melted, that his Track
might be often lost; when he came near one of the Villages of the
Five
Nations
, he hid himself till Night, and then entered a Cabin, while
every Body was fast asleep, murdered the whole Family, and carried their
Scalps into his lurking Place. The next day the People of the Village
searched for the Murderer in vain. The following Night he murdered all
he found in another Cabin. The Inhabitants next Day searched likewise in
vain for the Murderer; but the third Night a Watch was kept in every
House.
Piskaret
in the Night bundled up the Scalps he had taken the
two former Nights, to carry, as the Proof of his Victory, and then stole
privately from House to House, till at last he found an
Indian

nodding, who was upon the Watch in one of the Houses; he knockt this
Man on the Head; but as this alarmed the rest, he was forced immediately
to fly. He was however under no great Concern from the Pursuit, being
more swift of Foot than any
Indian
then living. He let his Pursuers
come near him from Time to Time, and then would dart from them. This he
did with Design to tire them out with the Hopes of overtaking Him. As it
began to grow dark, he hid himself, and his Pursuers stop'd to rest.
They not being apprehensive of any Danger from a single Man, soon fell
asleep, and the bold
Piskaret
observing this, knock'd them all on the
Head, and carried away their Scalps with the rest. Such Stories as these
are told among the
Indians
, as extraordinary Instances of the Courage
and Conduct of their Captains. The
Indians
will often travel thus
three or four Hundred Miles singly, or two or three in Company, and lurk
about their Enemy's Borders for several Weeks, in Hopes to revenge the
Death of a near Relation or dear Friend. Indeed they give themselves so
very much up to Revenge, that this Passion seems to gnaw their Souls,
and gives them no Rest till they satisfy it. It is this Delight in
Revenge, that makes all barbarous Nations cruel; and the curbing such
Passions is one of the happy Effects of being civilized.

The
Five Nations
are so much delighted with Stratagems in War, that no
Superiority of their Forces ever make them neglect them. They amused the

Adirondacks
and their Allies the
Quatoghies
(called by the
French
Hurons
) by sending to the
French
, and desiring Peace. The
French

desired them to receive some Priests among them, in Hopes that those
prudent Fathers would, by some Art, reconcile them to their Interest,
and engage their Affections. The
Five Nations
readily accepted the
Offer, and some
Jesuits
went along with them: But after they had the
Jesuits in their Power, they used them only as Hostages, and thereby
obliged the
French
to stand neuter, while they prepared to attack the

Adirondacks
and
Quatoghies
, and they defeated the
Quatoghies
in a
dreadful Battle fought within two Leagues of
Quebeck
.

The
French
own, That if the
Five Nations
had known their Weakness at
that Time, they might have easily destroyed the whole Colony.

This Defeat, in Sight of the
French
Settlements, struck Terror into
all their Allies, who were at that Time very numerous, because of the
Trade with the
French
, which furnished them with many the most useful
Conveniences; for before that Time the
Indians
had no Iron Tool among
them.

The
Nipeceriniens
, who then lived on the Banks of
St. Laurence
River
, fled upon this to the Northward, believing that the extreme
Coldness of the Climate, and a barren Soil, would be the securest
Defence against the Ambition of the
Five Nations
. The Remainder of the

Quatoghies
fled with the
Utawawas
Southwestward; and for the greater
Security, settled in an Island, which being further than the Name of the

Five Nations
had then reached, they trusted to the Distance of the
Place, and the Advantage of its Situation.

Their last Expedition having succeeded so well, the
Five Nations
gave
out, that they intended next Winter to visit
Yonnendio
, (the Name they
give to the Governor of
Canada
;) these Visits are always made with
much Shew. Under this Pretence they gathered together 1000 or 1200 Men.
Their out Scouts met with
Piskaret
near
Niccolet River
, and still
pretending a friendly Visit to the Governor of
Canada
, as their only
Design, he told them, that the
Adirondacks
were divided into two
Bodies, one of which hunted on the North Side of
St. Laurence River
at

Wabmake
, three Leagues above
Trois Rivieres
, and the other at

Nicolet
. As soon as they had gained this Information, they killed him,
and returned with his Head to the Army. The
Five Nations
divided
likewise into two Bodies; they surprized the
Adirondacks
in both
Places, and in both cut them in pieces.

Thus the most warlike and polite Nation of all the
Indians
in
North
America
, was almost intirely destroyed by a People they at first
despised, and by a War which their Pride and Injustice brought upon
them; and we here see, that all the Advantages of Numbers, Courage and
Weapons, is not equal to good discipline in an Army.

A very few
Adirondacks
only now remain in some Villages near

Quebeck
, who still waste away and decay, by their drinking strong
Waters, tho' when the
French
first settled at
Quebeck
, 1500 fighting
Men of them lived between that Place and
Sillerie
, which are only a
League distant, besides those that lived at
Saquenay, Trois Rivieres
,
and some other Places. And since this decisive Battle, the
Adirondacks

have never been considered as of any Consequence, either in Peace or
War.

The
Quatoghies
and
Atawawas
now soon began to be in Want of the

European
Commodities, which had made them considerable among their
new Friends. In order therefore to supply themselves anew, they
returned to Trade at
Quebeck
; and by this Means the Place of their
Retreat was discovered to the
five Nations
; and they not having their
Revenge satiated, while the
Quatoghies
had a Being, soon convinced
them, that no Extent of Country could set bounds to that Passion, when
it rages in the Hearts of the
Five Nations
, for they soon after
attack'd them in their new Settlement. The
Quatoghies
had the good
Fortune to discover the
Five Nations
Time enough to make their Escape,
and fled to the
Putewatemies
, who lived a Day's Journey further, where
they, and all the Neighbouring Nations, secured themselves in a large
Fort. The
Five Nations
followed, but, being in Want of Provision, they
could not attempt a Siege, and therefore proposed a Treaty with the

Putewatemies
, which was accepted. The
Putewatemies
acknowledged the

Five Nations
as Masters of all the Nations round them, applauded their
Valour, and promised them their Friendship, and to supply them with
Provisions; they would not however trust themselves out of their Fort,
but sent out a Supply; and even this they did, only with Design to do
that by Treachery, which they durst not attempt by Force; for the
Provisions were poisoned. The Treachery was discovered however to the

Five Nations
, by an old
Quatoghie
, who had a Son Prisoner among
them; his Affection for his Son overcoming even his Hatred to his
Country's Enemies. This Treachery highly enraged the
Five Nations

against the
Putewatemies
, and the neighbouring People; but Famine
obliging them to retire at this Time, they divided their Armies into
Parties, the better to provide for their Subsistence, by Hunting; one of
these Parties in their Chace fell in with a Village of the

Chicktaghicks
(called by the
French Hinois
) and surprized the old
Men, Women and Children, when the young Men were abroad hunting; but
the young Men, upon their Return, gathering together all the rest of the
Villages, pursued this Party of the
Five Nations
, and recovered the
Prisoners.

This was the first Time that the
Five Nations
had been seen in those
Parts, but their Name was become so terrible, that the
Chictaghicks
,
notwithstanding this Advantage, left their Country, and fled to the
Nations that lived westward, till the General Peace was settled by the

French
, and not till on that Occasion returned to their own Country.

CHAP. II.

The Wars and Treaties of Peace of the
Indians
of the
Five Nations

with the
French,
from
1665
to
1683,
and their Affairs with

New-York
in that Time
.

I
n
June
1665
Monsieur De Trasi
appointed
Vice-Roy
of
America
by
the
French King
, arrived at
Quebeck
, after he had visited the

French Islands
in the
West Indies
, and brought with him four
Companies of Foot; and in
September
of the same Year,
Mr. Coursel

arrived Governor General of
Canada
; he brought with him a Regiment and
several Families, with all Things necessary for establishing of a
Colony. Their Force being now thus considerably augmented, the
French

Governor resolved to chastise the Insolence of the
Five Nations
; and
for that Purpose, in the Winter, sent out a Party against the
Mohawks
,
but these by the Cold, and their not knowing the Use of Snow Shoes,
suffered very much, without doing any Thing against the Enemy.

This Party however fell in with
Skenectady
[6]
, a small Town which

Corlear
(a considerable Man among the
Dutch
) had then newly settled.
When they appeared near
Shenectady
, they were almost dead with Cold
and Hunger; and the
Indians
, who were then in that Village, had
intirely destroyed them, if
Corlear
, (in Compassion to his fellow
Christians) had not contriv'd their Escape. He had a mighty Influence
over the
Indians
; and it is from him, and in Remembrance of his Merit,
that all Governors of
New-York
are called
Corlear
by the
Indians

to this Day, tho' he himself was never Governor. He persuaded the

Indians
, that this was a small Party of the
French
Army come to
amuse them, that the great Body was gone directly towards their Castles,
and that it was necessary for them immediately to go in Defence of their
Wives and Children. This they believed, and readily obeyed; and as soon
as the
Indians
were gone, he sent to the
French
, and supplied them
with Provisions and other Necessaries to carry them back. The
French

Governor, in Order to reward so signal a Service, invited
Corlear
to

Canada
; but as he went through the great Lake, which lies to the
Northward of
Albany
, his Canoe was overset, and he was drowned; and
from this Accident that Lake has ever since been called
Corlear
's

Lake
, by the People of
New-York
. There is a Rock in this Lake, on
which the Waves dash and fly up to a great Height; when the Wind blows
hard, the
Indians
believe, that an old
Indian
lives under this Rock,
who has the Power of the Winds; and therefore, as they pass it in their
Voyages over, they always throw a Pipe, or some other small Present to
this old
Indian
, and pray a favourable Wind. The
English
that pass
with them sometimes laugh at them, but they are sure to be told of

Corlear
's Death. Your great Countryman
Corlear
(say they) as he
passed by this Rock, jested at our Fathers making Presents to this
Old
Indian
, and in Derision turned up his Backside, but this Affront cost
him his Life.

In the following Spring the
Vice-Roy
and the
Governor of Canada
,
with twenty eight Companies of Foot, and all the Militia of the Colony,
marched into the Country of the
Mohawks
, with a Design to destroy this
Nation, which by their Wars not only prevented their Commerce with the
western
Indians
, but likewise often put their Colony in Danger. It
certainly was a bold Attempt, to march above 700 Miles from
Quebeck

through vast unknown Forests. The
Mohawks
however, on their Approach,
Men, Women, and Children, retired into the Woods, and all that the

French
were able to do, was to burn some Villages, and to murder some
old
Sachems
that (like the old Roman Senators,) chose rather to dye
than to desert their Houses.

The
French
were so conceited before, of their Superiority over the

Indians
in their Skill of War, and their Weapons, that they thought
they could not escape, but the little Honour or Advantage they got by
this Expedition lessened their Vanity, and made them desirous of Peace;
and the
Five Nations
remaining fearful of the
French fire Arms
, it
was without much Difficulty concluded in the Year 1667.

The
Five Nations
however being naturally very enterprizing and
haughty, one of their Parties some Time after met with some
French
in
their hunting, and quarrelled with them. The
Indians
had the
Advantage, they killed several of the
French
, and carried one Prisoner
into their own Country.
Monsieur de Coursel
sent on this to threaten
the
Five Nations
with War, if they did not deliver up these Murderers;
and the
Five Nations
, to shew their publick Displeasure at this Breach
of Peace, sent
Agariata
, the Captain of the Company that did the
Mischief, with forty others, to beg Pardon; but
Monsieur Coursel
was
resolved to make an Example of
Agariata
, and ordered him to be hanged
in Sight of his Countrymen; and the
French
think that this Severity
was a great Means of preserving the Peace till the Year 1683.

The
Dutch
, who settled in the
New Netherlands
, now called

New-York
, in 1609, entered into an Alliance with the Five Nations,
which continued without any Breach on either Side, till the
English

gained this Country. The
Dutch
gained the Hearts of the
Five Nations

by their kind Usage, and were frequently useful to the
French
, in
saving those of them that were prisoners from the Cruelty of the

Indians
.

In 1664,
New-York
being taken by the
English
, they likewise
immediately entered into a Friendship with the
Five Nations
, which has
continued without the least Breach to this Day; and History, I believe,
cannot give an Instance of the most Christian or most Catholick Kings
observing a Treaty so strictly, and for so long a Time as these
Barbarians, as they are called, have done.

The
English
and
French
(Peace being every where settled) now
endeavoured to extend their Commerce and Alliances among the
Indian
Nations
, that live to the westward of
New-York
. The
French
however,
in their Measures, discovered always a Design of conquering and
commanding; for with this View
Mr. de Frontenac
, who had succeeded in
the Government of
Canada
, in the Year 1672, persuaded the
Five
Nations
to allow him to build a Fort on the north Side of
Cadarackui
Lake
, under Pretence of a Store for
Merchandise
, and the Security of
his Traders, and under the same Pretence built several other Forts at
some other considerable Places far in the Country.

The
English
and
Dutch
, on the contrary, prosecuted their Measures
only with the Arts of Peace, by sending People among the
Indians
to
gain their Affections, and to persuade them to come to
Albany
to
trade; but the War with the
Dutch
, which happened about this Time,
prevented even these honest Designs from having the Success they
otherwise might have had; for in the Year 1673,
New-York
being
surprised by the
Dutch
, and restored the next Year to the
English
,
the Alterations of Government, and of Masters, obstructed very much any
Measures that could have been taken for the publick Good. Their Trade
was likewise considerably hindered by the War which the
Five Nations

had at that Time with the River Indians
[7]
, which forced many of those

Indians
to seek Shelter among the
Utawawas
, who fell under the

French
Government at last; however, the
English
,
Dutch
and

French
having all made Peace in
Europe
, and the Government of

New-York
likewise having obtained a Peace between the
Five Nations

and
Mahikandars
or
River Indians
, both the
English
and
French

were at full Liberty to prosecute their Designs of extending their
Commerce among the
Indians
, which both did with very considerable
Success and Advantage to the Inhabitants of their respective Colonies.

But this Justice must be done to the
French
, that they far exceeded
the
English
in the daring Attempts of some of their Inhabitants, in
travelling very far among unknown
Indians
, discovering new Countries,
and every where spreading the Fame of the
French
Name and Grandeur.
The
Sieur Perot
travelled in the Year 1667 as far as
the Fall St.
Mary
beyond
Missilimakinak
, and having learned those
Indians

Language, gained them over to his Country's Interest.

The Courage and Resolution of many of these Adventurers are deservedly
recorded by the
French
; but the
English
give it another Turn, and
say it is the Barrenness and Poverty of
Canada
that pushes the Men of
Spirit there, upon Enterprizes, that they would not have attempted, if
they had lived in the Province of
New-York
. The chief Reason, in my
Opinion, however, of the
French
having so far succeeded beyond the

English
is, that the
Indian Affairs
are the particular Care of the
Governor and other principal Officers in
Canada
, who have the greatest
Knowledge and Authority; whereas those Affairs in
New-York
are chiefly
left to the Management of a few Traders with the
Indians
, who have no
Care for, or Skill in publick Affairs, and only mind their private
Interest.

CHAP. III.

Of the Transactions of the
Indians
of the
Five Nations
with the
neighbouring
English
Colonies
.

T
he
Five Nations
being now amply supplied by the
English
with
Fire-Arms and Ammunition, give full Swing to their warlike Genius, and
soon resolved to revenge the Affronts they had at any Time received from
the
Indian
Nations that lived at a greater Distance from them. The
nearest Nations, as they were attack'd, commonly fled to those that were
further off, and the
Five Nations
pursued them. This, together with a
Desire they had of conquering, or Ambition of making all the Nations
round them their Tributaries, or to acknowledge the
Five Nations
to be
so far their Masters, as to be absolutely directed by them in all
Affairs of Peace and War with their Neighbours, made them overrun great
Part of
North-America
. They carried their Arms as far South as

Carolina
, to the Northward of
New-England
, and as far West as the
River
Mississipi
, over a vast Country, which extends twelve hundred
Miles in Length, from North to South, and about six hundred Miles in
breadth; where they intirely destroyed many Nations, of whom there are
now no Accounts remaining among the
English
.

These warlike Expeditions often proved troublesome to the Colonies of

Virginia
and
Maryland
; for not only the
Indians
that were Friends
to those Colonies became Victims to the Fury of the
Five Nations
, but
the Christian Inhabitants likewise were frequently involved in the same
Calamity.

The
French
having a long Time felt the Inconveniencies and Dangers
they were in from this restless warlike Spirit of the
Five Nations
,
made use of this Time of Peace to guard against it for the future, and
were very diligent in pursuing the most prudent Measures. They sent some
of their wisest Priests and Jesuits to reside among them, and the
Governors of
New-York
were ordered, by the
Duke of York
, to give
these Priests all the Incouragement in their Power. The chief View of
these Priests was, to give the
Indians
the highest Opinion of the

French Power
and Wisdom, and to render the
English
as suspected and
as mean as possible in their Eyes. They waited likewise for every
Opportunity to breed a Quarrel between the
English
and the
Indians
,
and to withdraw the
Five Nations
from fighting with those Nations that
traded to
Canada
. For these Purposes these Priests were instrumental
in turning the Resentment of the
Five Nations
against the
Indians
,
that were in Friendship with
Virginia
and
Maryland
. The Governor of

Maryland
, on the other Hand, to prevent the ill Consequences, that
might happen by Wars between Nations that were in Friendship with the

English
, and lived in their Neighbourhood, sent
Colonel Coursey
, in
the Year 1677, to
Albany
, to increase the Friendship between

Virginia
and
Maryland
on the one Part, and the
Five Nations
on the
other; and, accordingly, both Sides gave mutual Promises at
Albany
:
But this good Understanding was soon shaken by some Parties of the

Oneydoes
,
Onondagas
, and
Senekas
, who were out when this Treaty
was made, and were ignorant of it. One of them met with the
Susguehana
Indians
, who were in Friendship with
Maryland
, and fell upon them;
they killed four of the
Susguehanas
, and took six Prisoners. Five of
these Prisoners fell to the Share of the
Senekas
, who, as soon as they
arrived in their own Country, sent them back with Presents, to shew that
they kept their Promises with
Maryland
; but the
Oneydoes
detained
the Prisoner they had.

Another Party, that went against the
Canagesse Indians
(Friends of

Virginia
) were surprised by a Troop of Horse, who killed one Man, and
took a Woman Prisoner: The
Indians
, in Revenge, killed four of the
Inhabitants, and carried away their Scalps, with six Christian
Prisoners.

The
Mohawks
, all this while, kept strictly to their Words, and
suffered none of their Men to go towards
Virginia
and
Maryland
.

There is Reason to think that the
Dutch
, who lived about
Albany
at
that Time, spirited up the
Indians
against the
English
; the national
Differences, that were then recent, bred a Rancour in their Spirits.
Some
Dutchmen
persuaded the
Oneydoes
, that the
English
at

New-York
were resolved to destroy them, and put them into a terrible
Disturbance; for here the
Dutch
and the
French
Priests joined in the
same Measures. The Commandant at
Albany
hearing of this, sent two
Interpreters of the
Indian
Language, to persuade the
Oneydoes
to
come to
Albany
, in Order to be assured of the
English
Friendship,
and to have their Jealousy removed; which being done,
Swerise
, one of
the chief
Sachems
of the
Oneydoes
, excused his Countrymen at

Albany
the fifteenth of
February
1678/9, by laying the Blame on the
People of
Schenectady
, who had informed not one, but several of their
People, and at several Times, that the
English
designed to cut them
all off; and said, had they not Reason to believe the People of

Schenectady
, who are Friends and Neighbours to the
English
? They
brought with them a Christian Woman and her Child, that had been taken
Prisoners, and restored them, praying the Governor to use his Interest
to have their People restored, that had been taken by the People of

Virginia
; but they kept another Christian Woman and her two Children,
which they said they did only till such Time as their Prisoners should
be restored, or some
Canastoga Indians
given in their Place.

When the
Five Nations
make Peace with another Nation, that has taken
some of the
Five Nations
Prisoners, if these Prisoners be dead, or
cannot be restored, they usually demand some
Indians
, in Friendship
with the
Five Nations
, in their stead; who either are adopted in Place
of their dead Friends, or restored to their own Nation; and sometimes
they desire some of their Enemies to be given to them, and even those
frequently are adopted by a Father in Place of a Son, or by a Sister in
Place of a Brother, and, most frequently, by a Wife in Place of a
Husband lost in the Wars; but if they chance not to be agreeable to the
Relations, then they are certainly made Sacrifices to their Revenge.

Governor
Andross
, being acquainted by Letter with this last Proposal
of the
Oneydoes
, required the immediate Delivery of the Christian
Prisoners, and promised to write to
Virginia
to have the
Indian

Prisoners sav'd. Some Presents being given to the
Oneydoes
, and they
promised to bring them in a Month's Time.

They, at the same Time, informed the Commandant at
Albany
, that eight
of their Men were then out against the People of
Virginia
; that they
knew nothing of what was now promised; and therefore, in Case they
should do any Harm, they desired that it might not be taken as a Breach
of their Promises they now made. They promised likewise to inform the
Governor of every Thing these Parties shou'd happen to do. In the last
Place they said, we shall be very sorry if any Thing should happen to
the Prisoners that we have promised to restore, lest it should create
some Jealousies of us, we hope that you will consider that they are
mortal. Accordingly, in
May
following, the
Oneydoes
brought the
other three Prisoners to
Albany
, and, on the Twenty-fourth of that
Month,
Swerise
, when he delivered them to the Commandant at
Albany
,
and the Commissioners for
Indian
Affairs, said,

"
Brethren
,

"We are come to this Place with much Trouble, as we did last
Winter, and renew the Request we then made, that six
Indians

be delivered to us in the Room of these six Christians, in Case
our People, who are Prisoners, be dead. None of us have gone out
against the Christians since we were last here; but we told you
then that some were then out, who knew nothing of the Governor's
Orders, and we desired, that if any Thing happened it might not
be taken ill. Now thirteen of our People, who went out against
our
Indian
Enemies, met eighteen Men on Horseback, as far from
any of the
English
Plantations as
Cahnuaga
is from
Albany
,
they fired upon our People; our Men, being Soldiers, returned
their Fire, and killed two Men and two Horses, and brought away
their Scalps.

"It would be convenient that the Governor tell the People of

Virginia
, not to send their Men so far from Home; for if they
should meet our Parties in their Way against our Enemies, the

Cahnowas
, whom the
English
call
Arogisti
, we cannot answer
for the Consequences.

"We have now observed the Governor's Orders, in bringing the
three other Christian Prisoners; and we trust the Affair of our
Prisoners wholly to the Governor.

"We have now performed our Promises: But where are our
Prisoners; or, if they be dead, the others in their Room, now
when it is so late in the Spring? However, we will still trust
this to the Governor."

Then delivering the Prisoners one by one, said, "We have, we
say, now performed our Promises, and are not ashamed. We hope

Corlaer
, who governs the whole Country, will likewise do that,
of which he need not be ashamed.

"
Corlaer
governs the whole Land, from
New-York
to
Albany
,
and from thence to the
Senekas Land
; we, who are his
Inferiors, shall faithfully keep the Chain: Let him perform his
Promise, as we have ours, that the Chain be not broken on his
Side, who governs the whole Country."

Then the Commissioners gave them Presents for their kind Usage
of the Prisoners.

After which
Swerise
stood up again and said; "Let
Corlaer

take Care, that the
Indian
Woman, that is wanting, be
restored, and, for those that are killed, others in their Room.
If
Corlaer
will not give Ear to us in this Affair, we will not
hereafter give Ear to him in any Thing."

Hearing afterwards, that these last Words were ill taken,

Swerise
, with two more of the chief
Oneydoe Sachems
, excused
it, saying; "What we said, of not hearkening any more to

Corlaer
, did not proceed from the Heart, but was spoken by Way
of Argument, to make
Corlaer
more careful to release our
People that are Prisoners; and you may be convinced it was so,
when you consider that it was said after your Answer, and
without laying down either Bever, or any Belt or Wampum, as we
always do, when we make Propositions
[8]
; therefore we desire,
that, if it be noted, it may be blotted out, and not made known
to
Corlaer
, for we hold firmly to our Covenant, as we said in
our Propositions."

They, at the same Time, told them, That the
Sinondowans
[9]
came to
them with eight Belts, desiring them no longer to prosecute the War with
the
Virginia Indians
, but to go to War against the
Dewaganas
[10]
, a
Nation lying to the North-westward; and that the
Sennekas
did desire
them to set these Christians at Liberty, and to carry them to
Albany
;
all which we promised to do.

The
Five Nations
continuing however still to be troublesome to

Virginia
, that Government, in
September
following, sent Colonel

William Kendall
, and Colonel
Southley Littleton
, to
Albany
, to
renew and confirm the Friendship between
Virginia
and the
Five
Nations
. Colonel
Littleton
died at
Albany
, before the
Indians

arrived; and Colonel
Kendall
spoke first to the
Oneydoes
, and told
them in a set Speech, "That their People had taken away and destroyed
their Goods and People, and brought some of the Women and Children of

Virginia
Captives into their Castles, contrary to that Faith and
Promise, and in Breach of the Peace made with Colonel
Coursey
, without
any the least Provocation, or Injury done, by the People of
Virginia
.
However, through the great Respect
Virginia
has to their Nations, and
by the Persuasions of the Governor of
New-York
, and the Information he
has given the Government of
Virginia
, that they had quietly and
peaceably delivered to him the Prisoners taken from
Virginia
, who were
returned safely; and their excusing the same, and Inclination to live
peaceably, without injuring
Virginia
for the future; the Government
of
Virginia
did forgive all the Damages the
Five Nations
have done
to the People of
Virginia
, though very great; provided that they, or
any living among them, for the future, do not offend, or molest the
People of
Virginia
, or
Indians
living among them."

He spoke to the
Mohawks
and
Sennekas
, separately from the

Oneydoes
, because they had not done any Mischief, and promised them
kind and neighbourly Usage when they came to
Virginia
, and gave them
Presents; they returned the Compliment, with an Assurance of their
Friendship, and condoled Colonel
Littleton
's Death, after the
Indian

Manner, by a
Present of a Belt of black Wampum
, besides the Belt given,
on renewal of the Friendship.

The
Onnondagas
did not come till
November
; on the fifth of which
Month the
Virginia
Agent spoke to them, in the same Words he did to
the
Oneydoes
. It does not appear, by the Register of
Indian
Affairs,
what Answer the
Oneydoes
and
Onnondagas
made, but it is certain they
did not observe Friendship with
Virginia
, but molested them with
reiterated Incursions of their Parties. It is observable, however, that
these two Nations, and the
Cayugas
, only had
French
Priests among
them at that Time, and that none of the rest ever molested the

English
; for which Reason, Colonel
Dongan
, notwithstanding the
Orders he had received from his Master, and that he himself was a
Papist, complained of the ill Offices these Priests did to the
English

Interest, and forbid the
Five Nations
to entertain any of them; though
the
English
and
French
Crowns, while he was Governor of
New-York
,
seemed to be more than ever in strict Friendship.

The
French
had no Hopes of persuading the
Five Nations
to break with

New-York
directly, but they were in Hopes, that, by the
Indian

Parties doing frequent Mischief in
Virginia
, the Government of

New-York
would be forced to join, in resenting the Injury, and
thereby that Union, between the Government of
New-York
and the
Five
Nations
, would be broke, which always obstructed, and often defeated,
the Design the
French
had, of subjecting all
North America
to the
Crown of
France
. For this Reason, the Governors of
New-York
have
always, with the greatest Caution, avoided a Breach with these Nations,
on Account of the little Differences they had with the neighbouring
Colonies. These new Incursions of these two Nations were so troublesome
to the People of
Virginia
, that their Governor, the Lord
Howard of
Effingham
, thought it necessary, for their Security, to undertake a
Journey to
New-York
.

I shall give a particular Account of this Affair, which was thought of
such Consequence, that a Peer of
England
left his Government, and
travelled four-hundred Miles, to treat with the
Five Nations
; and
shall take this Opportunity of describing some Ceremonies they use, in
making Peace.

The
Sachems
of the
Five Nations
being called to
Albany
, eight

Mohawks
, three
Oneydoes
, three
Onnondagas
, and three
Cayuga
Sachems
, met his Lordship there; and, on the thirteenth of
July
,
1684, he, accompanied by two of the Council of
Virginia
, spoke to the

Sachems
as follows, in the Presence of Colonel
Thomas Dongan
,
Governor of
New-York
, and the Magistrates of
Albany
. The
Senekas

being far off, were not then arrived.

Proposals made by the Right Honourable
Francis
Lord
Howard
of Effingham,
Governor-general of his Majesty's Dominion of

Virginia.

To

The
Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnondagas,
and
Cayugas.

"It is now about seven Years, said he, since you (unprovoked)
came into
Virginia
, a Country belonging to the great King of

England
, and committed several Murders and Robberies, carrying
away our Christian Women and Children Prisoners into your
Castles. All which Injuries we designed to have revenged on you,
but at the Desire of Sir
Edmond Andross
, then Governor-general
of this Country, we desisted from destroying you, and sent our
Agents, Colonel
William Kendal
, and Colonel
Southley
Littleton
, to confirm and make sure the Peace, that Colonel

Coursey
of
Maryland
included us in, when he first treated
with you. We find, that as you quickly forgot what you promised
Colonel
Coursey
, so you have wilfully broke the Covenant-chain
which you promised our Agent, Colonel
Kendal
, should be kept
more strong and bright, if we of
Virginia
would bury, in the
Pit of Oblivion, the Injury then done us; which, upon Governor

Andross
's Intercession, and your Submission, we were willing
to forget: But you not at all minding the Covenant then made,
have every Year since, come into our Country in a war-like
Manner, under Pretence of fighting with our
Indians
, our
Friends and Neighbours, which you ought not to have done, our
Agent having included them likewise in the Peace. You not only
destroyed, and took several of them Prisoners, but you have also
killed and burnt our Christian People, destroying Corn and
Tobacco, more than you made Use of, killed our Horses, Hogs, and
Cattle; not to eat, but to let them lie in the Woods and stink:
This you did, when you were not denied any Thing you said you
wanted.

"I must also tell you, that, under the Pretence of Friendship,
you have come to Houses at the Heads of our Rivers (when they
have been fortified) with a white Sheet on a Pole, and have laid
down your Guns before the Fort; upon which, our People taking
you for Friends, have admitted your great Men into their Forts,
and have given them Meat and Drink, what they desired. After the
great Men had refreshed themselves, and desiring to return, as
they were let out of the Fort-gates, the young Men commonly
rushed into the Fort, and plundered the Houses, taking away, and
destroying all the Corn, Tobacco, and Bedding, and what else was
in the Houses. When they went away, they generally also took
several Sheep with them, and killed several Cows big with Calf,
and left them behind them cut to Pieces, and flung about, as if
it were in Defiance of us, and in Derision of our Friendship.
These, and many more Injuries that you have done us, have caused
me to raise Forces, to send to the Heads of our Rivers, to
defend our People from these Outrages, till I came to

New-York
, to Colonel
Thomas Dongan
, your Governor-general,
to desire him, as we are all one King's Subjects, to assist me
in warring against you, to revenge the Christian Blood that you
have shed, and to make you give full Satisfaction for all the
Goods that you have destroyed: But by the Mediation of your
Governor, I am now come to
Albany
to speak with you, and to
know the Reason of your breaking the Covenant-chain, not only
with us and our neighbour
Indians
, but with
Maryland
, who
are great King
Charles
's Subjects; for our
Indians
have
given King
Charles
their Land; therefore I, the Governor of

Virginia
, will protect them, as your Governor, under the great

Duke of York
and
Albany
, will henceforth you, when the Chain
of Friendship is made between us all.

"Now I have let you know, that I am sensible of all the Injuries
you have done us, and by the Desire of your Governor-general, I
am willing to make a new Chain with you for
Virginia
,

Maryland
, and our
Indians
, that may be more strong and
lasting, even to the Word's End; so that we may be Brethren, and
great King
Charles
's Children.

"I propose to you,
first
, That you call out of our Countries
of
Virginia
and
Maryland
, all your young Men or Soldiers
that are now there.

"
Secondly
, That you do not hinder or molest our friendly

Indians
from hunting in our Mountains, it having been their
Country, and none of yours; they never go into your Country to
disturb any of you.

"
Thirdly
, Though the Damages you have done our Country be very
great, and would require a great deal of Satisfaction, which you
are bound to give; yet we assure you, that only by the
Persuasions of your Governor, who is at a vast deal of Trouble
and Charge for your Welfare, which you ever ought to
acknowledge, I have pass'd it by and forgiven you; upon this
Condition, that your People, nor any living among you, for the
future, ever commit any Incursions upon our Christians or

Indians
living among us, or in
Maryland
.

"For the better Confirmation of the same, and that the Peace now
concluded may be lasting, I propose to have two
[11]
Hatchets
buried, as a final Determination of all Wars and Jarrings
between us; one on behalf of us and our
Indians
, and the other
for all your
Nations
united together, that ever did us any
Injury, or pretended to war against our
Indian
Friends, or
those of
Maryland
.

"And that nothing may be wanting for Confirmation thereof (if
you desire it) we are willing to send some of our
Indian
Sachems
, with an Agent, next Summer, about this Time, that they
may ratify the Covenant with you here, in this prefixed House,
where you may see and speak together as Friends.

"That the Covenant now made between us, in this prefixed House,
in the Presence of your Governor, may be firmly kept and
performed on your Parts, as it always has been on ours; and that
you do not break any one Link of the Covenant-chain for the
future, by your People's coming near our Plantations; when you
march to the Southward, keep to the Feet of the Mountains, and
do not come nigh the Heads of our Rivers, there being no
Bever-hunting there; for we shall not for the future, though you
lay down your Arms as Friends, ever trust you more, you have so
often deceived us."

The next Day the
Mohawks
answer'd first by their Speaker, saying:

"We must, in the first Place, say something to the other three
Nations, by Way of Reproof, for their not keeping the former
Chain, as they ought; and therefore we desire you, great
Sachem
of Virginia
, and you
Corlaer
, and all here present to give
Ear, for we will conceal nothing of the Evil they have done."
[Then turning to the other Nations.] "You have heard Yesterday
all that has been said; as for our Parts, we are free of the
Blame laid on us; we have always been obedient to
Corlaer
, and
have steadily kept our Chain with
Virginia
,
Maryland
, and

Boston
; but ye are stupid and brutish, and have no
Understanding, we must stamp Understanding into you. Let the new
Chain made Yesterday be carefully preserved for the future. This
we earnestly recommend to you, for we are ready to cry for Shame
of you; let us be no more ashamed on your Account, but be
obedient, and
take this Belt
, to keep what we say in your
Memory.

"Hear now, now is the Time to hearken; the Covenant-chain had
very near slipt, by your not keeping it firmly. Hold it fast
now, when all former Evils are buried in the Pit.

"You
Oneydoes
, I speak to you as Children; be no longer
childish, or void of Understanding.

"You
Onondagas
, our Brethren, you are like deaf People, that
cannot hear, your Senses are covered with Dirt and Filth.

"You
Cayugas
, do not return into your former Ways. There are
three Things we must all observe.

"
First
, The Covenant with
Corlear
.
Secondly
, the Covenant
with
Virginia
and
Maryland
.
Thirdly
, with
Boston
. We
must stamp Understanding into you, that you may be obedient; and

take this Belt
for a Remembrancer."

Then
Cadianne
, the same
Mohawk
Speaker, turning to my Lord, said:

"We are very thankful to you, great
Sachem
of
Virginia
, that
you are persuaded by
Corlear
, our Governor, to forgive all
former Faults. We are very glad to hear you, and see your Heart
softened.
Take these three Bevers
as a Token.

"We thank the great
Sachem
of
Virginia
for saying, that the
Axe shall be thrown into the Pit.
Take these two Bevers
, as a
Token of our Joy and Thankfulness.

"We are glad that
Assarigoa
[12]
will bury in the Pit what is
past. Let the Earth be trod hard over it; or rather, let a
strong Stream run under the Pit, to wash the Evil away out of
our Sight and Remembrance, and that it may never be digged up
again.

"
Assarigoa
, you are a Man of Knowledge and Understanding, thus
to keep the Covenant-chain bright as Silver; and now again to
renew it, and make it stronger. (Then pointing to the three
other Nations, said,) But they are Chain-breakers. I lay down
this as a Token, that we
Mohawks
have preserved the Chain
intire on our Parts.
Gives two Bevers and a Racoon.

"The Covenant must be kept; for the Fire of Love of
Virginia

and
Maryland
burns in this Place, as well as ours, and this
House of Peace must be kept clean.
Gives two Bevers.

"We now plant a Tree
[13]
, whose Top will reach the Sun, and its
Branches spread far abroad, so that it shall be seen afar off;
and we shall shelter ourselves under it, and live in Peace
without Molestation. Here he
gave two Bevers.

"You proposed Yesterday, that if we were desirous to see the

Indians
of
Virginia
, you are willing to send some of their

Sachems
next Summer, about this Time, to this Place. This
Proposal pleases me very much, the sooner they come the better,
that we may speak with them in this House, which is appointed
for our speaking with our Friends; and
give two Belts
to confirm
it.

"You have now heard what Exhortation we have made to the other
three Nations; we have taken the Hatchet out of their Hands; we
now therefore pray, that both your Hatchets may likewise be
buried in a deep Pit.
Giving two Bevers.

"
Assarigoa
, some of us
Mohawks
are out against our Enemies,
that lie afar off, they will do you no Harm, nor plunder, as the
others do. Be kind to them, if they shall happen to come to any
of your Plantations; give them some Tobacco and some Victuals;
for they will neither rob nor steal, as the
Oneydoes
,

Onnondagas
, and
Cayugas
have done.

"The
Oneydoes
particularly thank you, great
Sachem
of

Virginia
, for consenting to lay down the Axe. The Hatchet is
taken out of all their Hands.
Gives a Belt.

"We again thank
Assarigoa
, that he has made a new Chain. Let
it be kept bright and clean, and held fast on all Sides; let not
any one pull his Arm from it. We include all the
four Nations
,
in giving this Belt.

"We again pray
Assarigoa
, to take the
Oneydoes
into his
Favour, and keep the Chain strong with them; for they are our
Children.
Gives a Belt.

"The
Oneydoes

give twenty Bevers
, as a Satisfaction for what
they promised the Lord
Baltimore
, and desire that they may be
discharged of that Debt."

The two Governors told them, that they would use their Endeavours with
the Lord
Baltimore
, to persuade him to forgive what remained.

Then the
Indians
desired that the Hole might be dug, to bury the Axes,

viz.
one in Behalf of
Virginia
and their
Indians
, another in
Behalf of
Maryland
and theirs, and three for the
Onnondagas
,

Oneydoes
, and
Cayugas
. The
Mohawks
said, there was no Need of
burying any on their Account, for the first Chain had never been broke
by them.

Then the three Nations spoke by an
Onnondaga
, called
Thanohjanihta
,
who said:

"We thank the great
Sachem of Virginia
, that he has so readily
forgiven and forgot the Injuries that have been done; and we,
for our Parts, gladly catch at, and lay hold of the new Chain.
Then each of them delivered an Axe to be buried, and
gave a
Belt
.

"I speak in the Name of all three Nations, and include them in
this Chain, which we desire may be kept clean and bright like
Silver.
Gives a Belt.

"We desire that the Path may be open for the
Indians
under

Assarigoa
's Protection, to come safely and freely to this
Place, in order to confirm the Peace."
Gives six Fathom of
Wampum.

Then the Axes were buried in the south-east End of the Court-yard, and
the
Indians
threw the Earth upon them; after which the Lord
Howard

told them, since now a firm Peace is concluded, we shall hereafter
remain Friends, and
Virginia
and
Maryland
will send once in two or
three Years to renew it, and some of our
Sachems
shall come, according
to your Desire, to confirm it.

Last of all the
Oneydoes
, the
Onnondagas
, and
Cayugas
, jointly
sang the Peace-song, with Demonstrations of much Joy; and thanked the
Governor of
New-York
for his effectual Mediation with the Governor of

Virginia
in their Favour.

Colonel
Dungan
had gained the Affections of the
Five Nations
, and
they esteemed him much.

They desired the
Duke of York
's Arms to put upon their
Castles
,
which, from the Sequel of their Story, we may suppose they were told
would save them from the
French
. Colonel
Dungan
desired them to
call Home those of their Nations that had settled in
Canada
[14]
. To
which they answered,
Corlear
keeps a Correspondence and Friendship
with
Canada
, and therefore he can prevail more than we can. Let

Corlear
use his Endeavours to draw our
Indians
Home to their own
Country.

The Government of the
Massachusets Bay
had appointed Colonel

Stephanus Cortland
, one of the Council of
New-York
, their Agent at
this Time, to renew their Friendship likewise with the
Five Nations
,
and to give them some small Presents; which was accordingly done.

The Governor of
New-York
, Colonel
Dungan
, concluded with this Advice
to them: Keep a good Understanding among yourselves; if any Difference
happen, acquaint me with it, and I will compose it. Make no Agreement
with the
French
, or any other Nation, without my Knowledge and
Approbation. Then he gave the Duke's Arms to be put up at each of their
Castles, in Hopes it might deter the
French
from attacking them, (as
they were threatened from
Canada
) by this so manifest a Declaration of
their being under the Protection of the Crown of
England
, when the two
Crowns were in the strictest Friendship; but it is probable the
French

chose this very Time to attack them, to bring them off from that
Confidence they seemed to have in the
English
.

It may be proper, before I proceed, to insert here also a remarkable
Speech made by the
Onnondagas
and
Cayugas
to the two Governors, on
the second Day of
August
,
viz.

"
Brother
Corlear,

"Your
Sachem
is a great
Sachem
, and we are but a small
People; but when the
English
came first to
Manhatan
,
[15]
to

Aragiske
[16]
and to
Yakokranagary
[17]
, they were then but a
small People, and we were great. Then, because we found you a
good People, we treated you kindly, and gave you Land; we hope
therefore, now that you are great, and we small, you will
protect us from the
French
. If you do not, we shall lose all
our Hunting and Bevers: The
French
will get all the Bevers.
The Reason they are now angry with us is, because we carry our
Bever to our Brethren.

"We have put our Lands and ourselves under the Protection of the
great
Duke of York
, the Brother of your great
Sachem
, who is
likewise a great
Sachem
.

"We have annexed the
Susquehana
River, which we won with the
Sword, to this Government; and we desire it may be a Branch of
the great Tree that grows in this Place, the Top of which
reaches the Sun, and its Branches shelter us from the
French
,
and all other Nations. Our Fire burns in your Houses, and your
Fire burns with us; we desire it may be so always. But we will
not that any of the great
Penn
's People settle upon the

Susquehana
River, for we have no other Land to leave to our
Children.

"Our young Men are Soldiers, and when they are provoked, they
are like Wolves in the Woods, as you,
Sachem
of
Virginia
,
very well know.

"We have put ourselves under the great
Sachem Charles
, that
lives on the other Side the great Lake. We
give you these two
white dressed Deer-skins
, to send to the great
Sachem
, that he
may write on them, and put a great red Seal to them, to confirm
what we now do; and put the
Susquehana
River above the Falls,
and all the rest of our Land under the great
Duke of York
, and
give that Land to none else. Our Brethren, his People, have been
like Fathers to our Wives and Children, and have given us Bread
when we were in Need of it; we will not therefore join
ourselves, or our Land, to any other Government but this. We
desire
Corlear
, our Governor, may send this our Proposition to
the great
Sachem Charles
, who dwells on the other Side the
great Lake, with this
Belt of Wampum
, and this other
smaller
Belt
to the
Duke of York
his Brother: And
we give you,

Corlear
, this Bever
, that you may send over this Proposition.

"You great Man of
Virginia
, we let you know, that great
Penn

did speak to us here in
Corlear
's House by his Agents, and
desired to buy the
Susquehana
River of us, but we would not
hearken to him, for we had fastened it to this Government.

"We desire you therefore to bear witness of what we now do, and
that we now confirm what we have done before. Let your Friend,
that lives on the other Side the great Lake, know this, that we
being a free People, though united to the
English
, may give
our Lands, and be joined to the
Sachem
we like best. We
give
this Bever
to remember what we say."

The
Senekas
arrived soon after, and, on the fifth of
August
, spoke
to the Lord
Howard
in the following Manner:

"We have heard and understood what Mischief hath been done in

Virginia
; we have it as perfect as if it were upon our Fingers
Ends. O
Corlear
! we thank you for having been our Intercessor,
so that the Axe has not fallen upon us.

"And you
Assarigoa
, great
Sachem of Virginia
, we thank you
for burying all Evil in the Pit. We are informed, that the

Mohawks
,
Oneydoes
,
Onnondagas
, and
Cayugas
, have buried
the Axe already; now we that live remotest off, are come to do
the same, and to include in this Chain the
Cahnawaas
, your
Friends. We desire therefore, that an Axe, on our Part, may be
buried with one of
Assarigoa
's. O
Corlear! Corlear!
we thank
you for laying hold of one End of the Axe; and we thank you,
great Governor of
Virginia
, not only for throwing aside the
Axe, but more especially for your putting all Evil from your
Heart. Now we have a new Chain, a strong and a straight Chain,
that cannot be broken. The Tree of Peace is planted so firmly,
that it cannot be moved, let us on both Sides hold the Chain
fast.

"We understand what you said of the great
Sachem
, that lives
on the other Side the great Water.

"You tell us, that the
Cahnawaas
will come hither, to
strengthen the Chain. Let them not make any Excuse, that they
are old and feeble, or that their Feet are sore. If the old

Sachems
cannot, let the young Men come. We shall not fail to
come hither, tho' we live farthest off, and then the new Chain
will be stronger and brighter.

"We understand, that because of the Mischief that has been done
to the People and Castles of
Virginia
and
Maryland
, we must
not come near the Heads of your Rivers, nor near your
Plantations, but keep at the Foot of the Mountains; for tho' we
lay down our Arms, as Friends, we shall not be trusted for the
future, but looked on as Robbers. We agree however to this
Proposition, and shall wholly stay away from
Virginia
: And
this we do in Gratitude to
Corlear
, who has been at so great
Pains to persuade you, great Governor of
Virginia
, to forget
what is past. You are wise in giving Ear to
Corlear
's good
Advice, for we shall now go a Path which was never trod before.

"We have now done speaking to
Corlear
, and the Governor of

Virginia
; let the Chain be for ever kept clean and bright by
him, and we shall do the same.

"The other Nations from the
Mohawks
Country to the
Cayugas
,
have delivered up the
Susquehana
River, and all that Country,
to
Corlear
's Government. We confirm what they have done by

giving this Belt
."

Coll.
Bird
, one of the Council of
Virginia
, and
Edmond Jennings
Esq
; Attorney General of that Province, came with four
Indian
Sachems
, (according to the Lord
Howard
's Promise) to renew and
confirm the Peace, and met the
Five Nations
at
Albany
in
September

1685.

Coll.
Bird
accused them of having again broke their Promise, by taking
an
Indian
Girl from an
English
Man's House, and four
Indian
Boys
Prisoners.

They excused this, by its being done by the Parties that were out when
the Peace was concluded, who knew nothing of it; which Accident they had
provided against in their Articles. They said, the four Boys were given
to the Relations of those Men that were lost; and it would be difficult
to obtain their Restoration: But they at last promised to deliver them
up.

The
Senakas
and
Mohawks
declared themselves free of any Blame, and
chid the other Nations.

So that we may still observe the Influence which the
French
Priests
had obtained over those other Nations, and to what Christian like
Purpose they used it.

The
Mohawks
Speaker said, "Where shall I seek the Chain of Peace?
Where shall I find it but upon our Path
[18]
? And whither doth our Path
lead us, but into this House? This is a House of Peace;" after this he
sang all the Links of the Chain over. He afterwards sang by Way of
Admonition to the
Onondagas
,
Oneydoes
, and
Cayugas
, and concluded
all with a Song to the
Virginia Indians
.

The
French Priests
however still employed their Influence over the

Onnondagas
,
Cayugas
, and
Oneydoes
; and it was easy for them to
spirit up the
Indians
(naturally revengeful) against their old
Enemies. A Party of the
Oneydoes
went out two Years after this against
the
Wayanoak Indians
, Friends of
Virginia
, and killed some of the
People of
Virginia
, who assisted those
Indians
. They took six
Prisoners, but restored them at
Albany
, with an Excuse, that they did
not know they were Friends of
Virginia
. But Coll.
Dungan
on this
Occasion told them, That he only had kept all the
English
in

North-America
from joining together to destroy them; that if ever he
should hear of the like Complaint, he would dig up the Hatchet, and join
with the rest of the
English
to cut them off Root and Branch; for
there were many Complaints made of him to the King by the
English
, as
well as by the Governor of
Canada
, for his favouring of them.

We have now gone through the material Transactions which the
Five
Nations
had with the
English
, in which we find the
English
pursuing
nothing but peaceable and Christian-like Measures; and the
Five
Nations
(tho' Barbarians) living with the People of
New-York
, like
good Neighbours and faithful Friends, and generally with all the

English
also, except when they were influenced by the
Jesuites
; at
the same Time, one cannot but admire the Zeal, Courage, and Resolution
of these Jesuites, that would adventure to live among
Indians
at War
with their Nation; and the better to carry their Purposes, to comply
with all the Humours and Manners of such a wild People, so as not to be
distinguished by Strangers from meer
Indians
. One of them, named

Milet
, remained with the
Oneydoes
till after the Year 1694; he was
advanced to the Degree of a
Sachem
, and had so great an Influence over
them, that the other Nations could not prevail with them to part with
him. While he lived with them, the
Oneydoes
were frequently turned
against the Southern
Indians
(Friends of the
English
southern
Colonies) and were always wavering in their Resolutions against the

French
at
Canada
.

We shall now see what Effect the Policy of the
French
had, who pursued
very different Measures from the
English
.

CHAP. IV.

Mr
. De la Barre'
s Expedition, and some remarkable Transactions in

1684.

T
he
French
, in the Time they were at Peace with the
Five Nations
,
built their Forts at
Taidonderaghi
and
Missilimakinak
, and made a
Settlement there. They carried on their Commerce among the numerous
Nations that live on the Banks of the great Lakes, and the Banks of the

Mississipi
; they not only prosecuted their Trade among these Nations,
but did all they could to secure their Obedience, and to make them
absolutely subject to the Crown of
France
, by building Forts at the
considerable Passes, and placing small Garisons in them. They took in
short all the Precautions in their Power, not only to restrain the

Indians
by Force, but likewise to gain their Affections, by sending

Missionaries
among them. The only Obstruction they met with was from
the
Five Nations
, who introduced the
English
of
New-York
into the
Lakes to trade with the
Indians
that lived round them. This gave the

French
much Uneasiness, because they foresaw, that the
English
would
not only prove dangerous Rivals, but that the Advantages which they had
in Trade, beyond what it was possible for the Inhabitants of
Canada
to
have, would enable the People of
New-York
so far to undersel them,
that their Trade would soon be ruined, and all the Interest lost which
they had gained with so much Labour and Expence. The
Five Nations

likewise continued in War with many of the Nations, with the

Chictaghicks
particularly, who yielded the most profitable Trade to
the
French
; and as often as they discovered any of the
French

carrying Ammunition towards these Nations, they fell upon them, and took
all their Powder, Lead and Arms from them. This made the
French

Traders afraid of travelling, and prevented their
Indians
from
hunting, and also lessened the Opinion they had of the
French
Power,
when they found that the
French
were not able to protect them against
the Insults of the
Five Nations
.

The
Senakas
lie next to the Lakes, and nearest to the Nations with
whom the
French
carried on the greatest Trade, these People were so
averse to that Nation, that they would never receive any Priests among
them, and of Consequence were most firmly attach'd to the
English

Interest, who supplied them with Arms and Powder (the Means to be
revenged of their Enemies.) For these Reasons Mr.
De la Barre

(Governor of
Canada
) sent a Messenger to Coll.
Dungan
, to complain
of the Injuries the
Senakas
had done to the
French
, and to shew the
Necessity he was under to bring the
Five Nations
to Reason by Force of
Arms. This Messenger happening to arrive at the Time the
Indians
met
the Lord
Howard
at
Albany
, Coll.
Dungan
told the
Senakas
the
Complaints that the
French
Governor made of them. To which they gave
him the following Answer, in Presence of Mr.
De la Barre
's Messenger,
on the 5th of
August
1684.

"We were sent for, and are come, and have heard what you have
said to us, that
Corlear
hath great Complaints of us, both
from
Virginia
and
Canada
. What they complain of from

Canada
may possibly be true, that some of our young Men have
taken some of their Goods, but
Yonnendio
the Governor of

Canada
, is the Cause of it. He not only permits his People to
carry Ammunition, Guns, Powder, Lead, and Axes to the

Tuihtuih-ronoons
[19]
our Enemies, but sends them thither on
purpose. These Guns which he sends knock our Bever Hunters on
the Head, and our Enemies carry the Bevers to
Canada
that we
would have brought to our Brethren. Our Bever Hunters are
Soldiers, and could bear this no longer. They met some
French

in their Way to our Enemies, and very near them, carrying
Ammunition, which our Men took from them. This is agreeable to
our Customs in War; and we may therefore openly own it, tho' we
know not whether it be practised by the Christians in such like
Cases.

"When the Governor of
Canada
speaks to us of the Chain, he
calls us Children, and saith, I am your Father, you must hold
fast the Chain, and I will do the same: I will protect you as a
Father doth his Children. Is this Protection, to speak thus with
his Lips, and at the same Time to knock us on the Head, by
assisting our Enemies with Ammunition?

"He always says, I am your Father, and you are my Children; and
yet he is angry with his Children, for taking these Goods.

"But, O
Corlear
! O
Assarigoa
! we must complain to you; you

Corlear
are a Lord, and govern this Country; is it just that
our Father is going to fight with us for these Things, or is it
well done? We rejoiced when
La Sal
was sent over the great
Water; and when
Perot
was removed, because they had furnished
our Enemies with Ammunition; but we are disappointed in our
Hopes, for we find our Enemies are still supplied. Is this well
done? Yea, he often forbids us to make War on any of the Nations
with whom he trades; and at the same Time furnishes them with
all Sorts of Ammunition, to enable them to destroy us.

"Thus far in Answer to the Complaint the Governor of
Canada

hath made of us to
Corlear
.
Corlear
said to us, that
Satisfaction must be made to the
French
for the Mischief we
have done them. This he said before he heard our Answer. Now let
him that hath Inspection over all our Countries, on whom our
Eyes are fixed, let him, even
Corlear
, judge and determine. If
you say that it must be paid, we shall pay it, but we cannot
live without free Bever Hunting.

"
Corlear
, hear what we say, we thank you for the Duke's Arms,
which you have given us to be put in our Castles, as a Defence
to them. You command them. Have we wandered out of the Way, as
the Governor of
Canada
says? We do not threaten him with War,
as he threatens us. What shall we do? Shall we run away, or
shall we sit still in our Houses? What shall we do? we speek to
him that governs and commands us.

"Now
Corlear
, and
Assarigoa
, and all People here present,
remember what we have answered to the Complaints of the Governor
of
Canada
; yea, we wish that what we here said may come to his
Ears." Then they
gave a Belt
.

Monsieur
De la Barre
at this Time was gone, with all the Force of

Canada
, to
Cadarackui Fort
, and ordered the three Vessels to be
repaired which the
French
had built on
Cadarackui Lake
: His Design
was to frighten the
Five Nations
into his own Terms, by the Appearance
of the
French
Army, which consisted of 600 Soldiers of the regular
Troops, 400
Indians
, and 400 Men that carried Provisions, besides 300
Men that he left to secure
Cadarackui Fort
, and the western

Indians
, that he expected would join him. But while he was at this
Fort, the Fatigue of travelling in the Month of
August
, together with
the Unhealthiness of that Place (the Country thereabout being very
marshy) where he tarried six Weeks, occasioned so great a Sickness in
his Army, that he found himself unable to perform any Thing but by
Treaty; and therefore sent Orders to Monsr.
Dulhut
, who was come from

Missilimakinak
with 600 Men,
French
and
Indians
, to stop. Monsr.

De la Barre
passed across the Lake, with as many Men as were able to
travel, and arrived at the River which the
French
call
La Famine
, by
the
Indians
called
Kaihohage
, which falls into the South Side of

Cadarackui Lake
, about thirty Miles from
Onnondago
. There were two
Villages of the
Five Nations
on the North Side of the Lake, about
fifteen Miles from the
French
Fort, consisting of those
Indians
that
had the most Inclination to the
French
: They provided the
French

Army with Provisions, while they remained at the Fort; but it is
probable, sent an Account to their own Nations of every Thing that
happened; and that this was the Reason of the Usage they afterwards met
with from the
French
.

When Monsr.
De la Barre
sent to Coll.
Dungan
, he was in Hopes, from
the strict Alliance that was then between the Crowns of
England
and

France
, and from Coll.
Dungan
's being a Papist, that he would at
least sit still till he had reduced the
Five Nations
. But none of
these Reasons permitted that Gentleman to be easy, while the
French

attempted such Things, as in their Consequences would be of the highest
Degree prejudicial to the
English
Interest, and might put all the

English
Colonies in
America
in Danger. Wherefore he dispatched the
publick Interpreter, with Orders to do every Thing in his Power to
prevent the
Five Nations
going to treat with Monsr.
De la Barre
.

The Interpreter succeeded in his Design with the
Mohawks
, and with
the
Senakas
, who promised that they would not go near the
French

Governor: But he had not the like Success with the
Onnondagas,
Oneydoes
, and
Cayugas
, who had received the
French
Priests, for
they would not hear the Interpreter, but in Presence of the
French

Priests, and Monsr.
la Main
, and three other
Frenchmen
that Monsr.

De la Barre
had sent to persuade them to meet him at
Kaihohage
; they
gave the following Answer to the Interpreter.

"
Arie
, you are
Corlear's Messenger
,
Ohquesse
[20]
(Monsr.

la Maine
) is the Governor of
Canada
's; and there
[21]
sits
our Father;
Yonnondio
acquainted us some Time ago, that he
would speak with us, before he would undertake any Thing against
the
Senakas
. Now he hath sent for all the Nations to speak
with him in Friendship, and that at a Place not far from

Onnondaga
, even at
Kaihohage
. But our Brother
Corlear

tells us, that we must not meet the Governor of
Canada
without
his Permission; and that if
Yonnondio
have any Thing to say to
us, he must first send to
Corlear
for Leave to speak with us.

Yonnondio
has sent long ago to us to speak with him, and he
has lately repeated that Desire by
Onnissantie
the Brother of
our Father
Twirhaersira
[22]
that sits there; he has not only
entreated us by our Father, but by two praying
Indians
, one an

Onnondaga
, the other the Son of an old
Mohawk Sachem
,

Connondowe
. They brought five great Belts of Wampum, not a
Fathom or two only, as you bring. Now
Ohquesse
has been sent
with three
Frenchmen
;
Yonnondio
not being content with all
this, has likewise sent
Dennehoct
, and two other
Mohawks
, to
persuade us to meet him, and to speak with him of good Things.
Should we not go to him after all this Intreaty, when he is come
so far, and so near to us? Certainly if we do not, we shall
provoke his Wrath, and not deserve his Goodness. You say we are
Subjects to the King of
England
and
Duke of York
, but we say
we are Brethren. We must take Care of ourselves. Those Arms
fixed upon the Posts, without the Gate, cannot defend us against
the Arms of
la Barre
. Brother
Corlear
, we tell you, that we
shall bind a Covenant Chain to our Arm, and to his, as thick as
that Post, (pointing to a Post of the House) be not
dissatisfied; should we not embrace this Happiness offered us,

viz
. Peace, in the Place of War; yea, we shall take the Evil
Doers, the
Senekas
, by the Hand, and
la Barre
likewise, and
their Ax and his Sword shall be thrown into a deep Water. We
wish our Brother
Corlear
were present, but it seems the Time
will not permit of it."

Accordingly
Garangula
, one of the chief
Sachems
of the
Onondaga's
,
with thirty Warriors, went with Mr.
Le Maine
, to meet the Governor of

Canada
at
Kaihohage
. After he had been two Days in the
French

Camp, Monsr.
la Barre
spoke to him as follows, (the
French
Officers
making a Semi-circle on one Side, while
Garangula
, with his Warriors,
compleated the Circle on the other.)

Monsr
. De la Barre's
Speech to
Garangula.
[23]

"The King, my Master, being informed that the
Five Nations

have often infringed the Peace, has ordered me to come hither
with a Guard, and to send
Ohguesse
to the
Onondagas
, to
bring the chief
Sachem
to my Camp. The Intention of the great
King is, that you and I may smoke the
Calumet
[24]
of Peace
together, but on this Condition, that you promise me, in the
Name of the
Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas
, and
Mohawks
, to
give intire Satisfaction and Reparation to his Subjects; and for
the future never to molest them.

"The
Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes
, and
Mohawks
have
robbed and abused all the Traders that were passing to the

Illinois
and
Umamies
, and other
Indian
Nations, the
Children of my King. They have acted, on these Occasions,
contrary to the Treaty of Peace with my Predecessor. I am
ordered therefore to demand Satisfaction, and to tell them, that
in case of Refusal, or their plundering us any more, that I have
express Orders to declare War. This Belt confirms my Words. The
Warriors of the
Five Nations
have conducted the
English
into
the Lakes, which belong to the King, my Master, and brought the

English
among the Nations that are his Children, to destroy
the Trade of his Subjects, and to withdraw these Nations from
him. They have carried the
English
thither, notwithstanding
the Prohibition of the late Governor of
New-York
, who foresaw
the Risque that both they and you would run. I am willing to
forget these Things, but if ever the like shall happen for the
future, I have express Orders to declare War against you. This
Belt confirms my Words. Your Warriors have made several
barbarous Incursions on the
Illinois
and
Umamies
; they have
massacred Men, Women, and Children, and have made many of these
Nations Prisoners, who thought themselves safe in their Villages
in Time of Peace. These People, who are my King's Children, must
not be your Slaves; you must give them their Liberty, and send
them back into their own Country. If the
Five Nations
shall
refuse to do this, I have express Orders to declare War against
them. This Belt confirms my Words.

"This is what I have to say to
Garangula
, that he may carry to
the
Senekas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, Cayugas
, and
Mohawks
the
Declaration which the King, my Master, has commanded me to make.
He doth not wish them to force him to send a great Army to

Cadarackui
Fort, to begin a War which must be fatal to them.
He would be sorry that this Fort, that was the Work of Peace,
should become the Prison of your Warriors. We must endeavour, on
both Sides, to prevent such Misfortunes. The
French
, who are
the Brethren and Friends of the
Five Nations
, will never
trouble their Repose, provided that the Satisfaction which I
demand be given, and that the Treaties of Peace be hereafter
observed. I shall be extremely grieved if my Words do not
produce the Effect which I expect from them; for then I shall be
obliged to join with the Governor of
New-York
, who is
commanded by his Master to assist me, and burn the Castles of
the
Five Nations
, and destroy you. This Belt confirms my
Words."

Garangala
was very much surprised to find the soft Words of the

Jesuit
, and of the Governor's Messengers, turned to such threatening
Language. This was designed to strike Terror into the
Indians
; but

Garangula
having good Information from those of the
Five Nations

living near
Cadarackui
Fort, of all the Sickness and other Misfortunes
which afflicted the
French
Army, it was far from producing the
designed Effect. All the Time that
Monsieur de la Barre
spoke,

Garangula
kept his Eyes fixed on the End of his Pipe; as soon as the
Governor had done speaking, he rose up, and having walked five or six
Times round the Circle, he returned to his Place, where he spoke
standing, while
Monsieur de la Barre
kept his Elbow-Chair.

Garangula's
Answer
.

"
Yonnondio
,

"I honour you, and the Warriors that are with me all likewise
honour you. Your Interpreter has finished your Speech; I now
begin mine. My Words make haste to reach your Ears, hearken to
them.

"
Yonnondio
, you must have believed, when you left
Quebeck
,
that the Sun had burnt up all the Forests which render our
Country inaccessible to the
French
, or that the Lakes had so
far overflown their Banks, that they had surrounded our Castles,
and that it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes,

Yonnondio
, surely you must have dreamt so, and the Curiosity
of seeing so great a Wonder has brought you so far. Now you are
undeceived, since that I and the Warriors here present are come
to assure you, that the
Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes
,
and
Mohawks
are yet alive. I thank you, in their Name, for
bringing back into their Country the
Calumet
, which your
Predecessor received from their Hands. It was happy for you,
that you left Underground that murdering Hatchet, that has been
so often dyed in the Blood of the
French
. Hear,
Yonnondio
, I
do not sleep, I have my Eyes open, and the Sun, which enlightens
me, discovers to me a great Captain at the Head of a Company of
Soldiers, who speaks as if he were dreaming. He says, that he
only came to the Lake to smoke on the great
Calumet
with the

Onondagas
. But
Garangula
says, that he sees the contrary,
that it was to knock them on the Head, if Sickness had not
weakened the Arms of the
French
.

"I see
Yonnondio
raving in a Camp of sick Men, whose Lives the
great Spirit has saved, by inflicting this Sickness on them.
Hear,
Yonnondio
, our Women had taken their Clubs, our Children
and old Men had carried their Bows and Arrows into the Heart of
your Camp, if our Warriors had not disarmed them, and kept them
back, when your Messenger,
Ohguesse
, came to our Castles. It
is done, and I have said it. Hear,
Yonnondio
, we plundered
none of the
French
, but those that carried Guns, Powder, and
Ball to the
Iwikties
and
Chictaghicks
, because those Arms
might have cost us our Lives. Herein we follow the Example of
the Jesuits, who stave all the Caggs of Rum brought to our
Castles, lest the drunken
Indians
should knock them on the
Head. Our Warriors have not Bevers enough to pay for all these
Arms, that they have taken, and our old Men are not afraid of
the War. This Belt preserves my Words.

"We carried the
English
into our Lakes, to trade there with
the
Utawawas
and
Quatoghies
, as the
Adirondacks
brought
the
French
to our Castles, to carry on a Trade which the

English
say is theirs. We are born free, we neither depend on

Yonnondio
nor
Corlear
.

"We may go where we please, and carry with us whom we please,
and buy and sell what we please: If your Allies be your Slaves,
use them as such, command them to receive no other but your
People. This Belt preserves my Words.

"We knock'd the
Twihtwies
and
Chictaghicks
on the Head,
because they had cut down the Trees of Peace, which were the
Limits of our Country. They have hunted Bevers on our Lands:
They have acted contrary to the Customs of all
Indians
; for
they left none of the Bevers alive, they killed both Male and
Female. They brought the
Satanas
[25]
into their Country, to
take Part with them, after they had concerted ill Designs
against us. We have done less than either the
English
or

French
, that have usurped the Lands of so many
Indian

Nations, and chased them from their own Country. This Belt
preserves my Words. Hear,
Yonnondio
, what I say is the Voice
of all the
Five Nations
; hear what they answer, open your Ears
to what they speak: The
Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes
,
and
Mohawks
say, that when they buried the Hatchet at

Cadarackui
(in the Presence of your Predecessor) in the Middle
of the Fort, they planted the Tree of Peace in the same Place,
to be there carefully preserved, that, in Place of a Retreat for
Soldiers, that Fort might be a Rendezvous for Merchants; that,
in Place of Arms and Ammunition of War, Bevers and Merchandise
should only enter there.

"Hear,
Yonnondio
, take Care for the future, that so great a
Number of Soldiers, as appear there, do not choak the Tree of
Peace planted in so small a Fort. It will be a great Loss, if
after it had so easily taken Root, you should stop its Growth,
and prevent its covering your Country and ours with its
Branches. I assure you, in the Name of the
Five Nations
, that
our Warriors shall dance to the
Calumet
of Peace under its
Leaves, and shall remain quiet on their Matts, and shall never
dig up the Hatchet, till their Brethren,
Yonnondio
or

Corlear
, shall either jointly or separately endeavour to
attack the Country, which the great Spirit has given to our
Ancestors. This Belt preserves my Words, and this other, the
Authority which the
Five Nations
has given me."

Then
Garangula
addressing himself to Monsieur
le Maine
, said:

"Take Courage,
Ohguesse
, you have Spirit, speak, explain my
Words, forget nothing, tell all that your Brethren and Friends
say to
Yonnondio
, your Governor, by the Mouth of
Garangula
,
who loves you, and desires you to accept of
this Present of
Bever
, and take Part with me in my Feast, to which I invite you.
This Present of Bever is sent to
Yonnondio
on the Part of the

Five Nations
."

When
Garangula
's Harangue was explained to Monsieur
de la Barre
, he
returned to his Tent, much inraged at what he had heard.

Garangula
feasted the
French
Officers, and then went Home, and
Monsieur
de la Barre
set out in his Way towards
Montreal
; and as
soon as the General was imbarked, with the few Soldiers that remained in
Health, the Militia made the best of their Way to their own Habitations,
without any Order or Discipline.

Thus a very chargeable and fatiguing Expedition (which was to strike the
Terror of the
French
Name into the stubborn Hearts of the
Five
Nations
) ended in a Scold between the
French
General and an old

Indian
.

CHAP. V.

The
English
attempt to trade in the Lakes
,
and the
French
attack
the
Senekas.

T
he
Marquis de Nonville
having now succeeded Monsieur
de la Barre
,
in the Year 1685, and having brought a considerable Reinforcement of
Soldiers with him, resolved to recover the Honour the
French
had lost
in the last Expedition, and revenge the Slaughter the
Five Nations

continued to make of the
Twihtwies
and
Chictaghicks
, who had put
themselves under the
French
Protection; for the
Five Nations
having
intirely subdued the
Chictaghicks
[26]
, after a six Years War, they
resolved next to fall upon the
Twihtwies
, and to call them to an
Account for the Disturbance they had given some of their People in their
Bever Hunting. The
Five Nations
have few or no Bever in their own
Country, and for that Reason are obliged to hunt at a great Distance,
which often occasions Disputes with their Neighbours about the Property
of the Bever. The Bever is the most valuable Branch of the
Indian

Trade, and as the
Twihtwies
carried their Bevers to the
French
, the

English
encouraged the
Five Nations
in these Expeditions, and
particularly, in the Beginning of the Year 1687, made the
Five Nations

a Present of a Barrel of Powder, when their whole Force was preparing to
go against the
Twihtwies
. The
English
were the better pleased with
this War, because they thought that it would divert the
Five Nations

from the
Virginia Indians
: But the
French
were resolved to support
their Friends more effectually by a powerful Diversion, and to change
the Seat of the War.

For this Purpose Mr.
de Nonville
sent, in
May
1687, great Quantities
of Provision to
Cadarackui
Fort, and gathered the whole Force of

Canada
to
Montreal
. His Army consisted of fifteen hundred
French

of the regular Troops and Militia, and five hundred
Indians
that lived
near
Montreal
and
Quebeck
. He sent likewise Orders to the Commandant
at
Missilimakinak
to assemble all the Nations living round him, and
to march them to
Oniagara
, in order to join the Forces of
Canada

designed against the
Senekas
, and the other Officers posted among the

Indians
Westward had the like Orders.

The
Twihtwies
received the Hatchet with Joy from the Hands of the

French
Officer. The
Outagamies
,
Kikabous
, and
Maskuticks
, who
were not used to Canoes, were at first persuaded to join the

Twihtwies
, who were to march by Land to
Teuchsagrondie
, where there
was a
French
Fort, at which they were to be supplied with Ammunition.
But after the
French
Officer left them, the
Utagamies
and

Maskuticks
were dissuaded by some of the
Mahikander Indians
, who
happened to be with a neighbouring Nation at that Time.

The
Putewatemies, Malhominies
, and
Puans
offered themselves
willingly, and went to the Rendezvous at
Missilimakinak
; where they
were received by the
Utawawas
with all the Marks of Honour usually
paid to Soldiers. Though the
Utawawas
had no Inclination to the
present Enterprize; they could not tell however how to appear against
it, otherwise than by inventing what Delays they could, to prevent their
March.

In the mean while a Canoe arrived, which was sent by Mr.
de Nonville
,
with his Orders to the Officers. This Canoe, in her Passage, discovered
some
English
, commanded by Major
Mac Gergory
, in their Way to

Teiodonderaghie
. The
English
thought (after they had an Account of
the new Alliance their King had entered into with the
French
) that the

French
would not disturb them in prosecuting a Trade with the

Indians
every where, and that the Trade would be equally free and open
to both Nations. With these Hopes a considerable Number of Adventurers
went out, under the Conduct of Major
Mac Gergory
, to trade with the

Indians
that lived on the Banks of the Lakes; and that they might be
the more welcome, persuaded the
Five Nations
to set all the

Dionondadie
Prisoners at Liberty, who went along with the
English
,
and conducted them towards
Missilimakinak
, or
Teiodonderaghie
; but
the
English
found themselves mistaken, for the
French
Commandant at

Teiodonderaghie
, as soon as he had Notice of this, sent three-hundred

French
to intercept the
English
.

[27]
The
Utawawas
and
Dionondadies
having likewise an Account of the

English
, designed to support their own Independency, and to incourage
the
English
Trade. The return of the
Dionondadie
Prisoners made that
Nation very hearty in favouring the
English
, they therefore marched
immediately off, with Design to join Major
Mac Gergory
; but the

Utawawas
were divided in their Inclinations, their Chief, with about
thirty more, joined the
French
, the rest remained in suspence, and
stood neuter.

The
Utawawas
thus wavering, disconcerted the Measures of the

Dionondadies
, for they began to suspect the
Utawawas
, and therefore
immediately returned to secure their Wives and Children that they had
left near the
French
Fort with the
Utawawas
. The
English
and their
Effects were seized without any Opposition, and were carried to the

French
Fort at
Teiodonderaghie
.

The
English
brought great Quantities of Rum with them, (which the

Indians
love more than their Lives) and the
French
being afraid,
that if the
Indians
took to Drinking, they would grow ungovernable,
did what they could to keep them from it. They were most concerned that
the
Putewatemies
(who had no Knowledge of the
English
, or of that
bewitching Liquor, and were firmly attached to the
French
) should not
taste it.

The
Utawawas
still contrived Delays to the March, and having got some
of the
Putewatemies
privately by themselves, they offered them a Cag
of Rum, and said: "We are all Brethren, we ought to make one Body, and
to have one Soul. The
French
invite us to war against the
Five
Nations
, with Design to make us Slaves, and that we should make
ourselves the Tools to effect it. As soon as they shall have destroyed
the
Five Nations
, they will no longer observe any Measures with us,
but use us like those Beasts they tie to their Ploughs. Let us leave
them to themselves, and they will never be able to accomplish any Thing
against the
Five Nations
."

But the
Putewatemies
had entertained such Notions of the
French
, as
made them deaf to the Politicks of the
Utawawas
.

The
French
however grew jealous of these Caballings, and therefore
resolved to delay their March no longer, and would not stay one Day more
for the
Utawawas
, who desired only so much Time to pitch their Canoes,
and went away without them.

Mr.
Tonti
, Commandant among the
Chictaghicks
, met with another Party
of the
English
of about thirty Men, in Lake
Erie
, as he marched with
the
Chicktaghicks
and
Twihtwies
, and other neighbouring Nations, to
the general Rendezvous. He fell upon the
English
, plundered them, and
took them Prisoners. The
French
divided all the Merchandize among the

Indians
, but kept the Rum to themselves, and got all drunk. The

Deonondadie
Prisoners, that conducted the
English
, joined with the

Mahikander

Indians
that were among Mr.
Tonti
's
Indians
(who had
privately dissuaded about twenty of the neighbouring Nations from going
with
Tonti
) and endeavoured to persuade all the
Indians
to fall upon
the
French
, while they were drunk, and destroy them; saying, the

French
are a proud, imperious, covetous People, that sell their Goods
at an extravagant Price; the
English
are a good natured honest
People, and will furnish you with every Thing at reasonable Rates. But
these Arguments were to no Purpose, for these far
Indians
had
entertained an extraordinary Opinion of the
French
Power, and knew
nothing of the
English
.

The
French
and
Putewatemies
being gone from
Teiodonderaghie
, the

Utawawas
began to be afraid of the
French
Resentment, and therefore,
the better to keep up the Colour they had put on their Delays, marched
over Land, with all possible Expedition, to the general Rendezvous near

Oniagara
, where all the
French
Force, both Christians and
Indians
,
was to meet.

The
Five Nations
being informed of the
French
Preparations, laid
aside their Design against the
Twihtwies
, and prepared to give the

French
a warm Reception. Upon this the Priest at
Onondaga
left them,
but the Priest at
Oneydo
had the Courage to stay. The
Senekas
came
to
Albany
to provide Ammunition, and the Commissioners made them a
Present of a considerable Quantity of Powder and Lead, besides what they
purchased. They were under a great deal of Concern when they took Leave
of the Commissioners, and said, "Since we are to expect no other
Assistance from our Brethren, we must recommend our Wives and Children
to you, who will fly to you, if any Misfortune shall happen to us. It
may be we shall never see you again; for we are resolved to behave so,
as our Brethren shall have no Reason to be ashamed of us."

We must now return to Monsieur
de Nonville
's Army.

Monsieur
Campagnie
marched eight or ten Days before the rest of the
Army, with between two and three hundred
Cannadians
. As soon as they
arrived at
Cadarackui
, they surprised two Villages of the
Five
Nations
, that were settled about eight Leagues from that Place, to
prevent their giving any Intelligence to their own Nation of the

French
Preparations, or of the State of their Army, as it was supposed
they did in the last Expedition under Monsieur
de la Barre
. These
People were surprised when they least expected it, and by them from whom
they feared no Harm, because they had settled there at the Invitation,
and on the Faith of the
French
. They were carried in cold Blood to the
Fort, and tied to Stakes, to be tormented by the
French Indians
,
(Christians, as they call them) while they continued singing in their
country Manner, and upbraiding the
French
with their Perfidy and
Ingratitude.

While Monsieur
de Nonville
was at
Cadarackui
Fort, he had an
Account, that the
Chicktaghicks
and
Twihtwies
waited for the

Quatoghies
and
Utawawas
at Lake
St. Clair
[28]
, with whom they
designed to march to the general Rendezvous, at the Mouth of the

Senekas
River. For this Expedition was chiefly designed against the

Senekas
, who had absolutely refused to meet Monsieur
de la Barre
,
and were most firmly attached to the
English
. The
Senekas
, for this
Reason, were designed to be made Examples of the
French
Resentment to
all the other Nations of
Indians
.

The Messenger having assured the General, that it was Time to depart, in
order to meet with the western
Indians
, that came to his Assistance,
he set out the twenty-third of
June
, and sent one Part of his Army in
Canoes, along the North Shore of the Lake, while he, with the other
Part, passed along the South, that no Accidents of Wind might prevent
the one or the other reaching, within the Time appointed, at the Place
the
Indians
were to meet him. It happened, by reason of the good
Weather, that both arrived on the same Day, and joined the western

Indians
at
Trondequat
, As soon as the Men were put on Shore, they
hawled up the Canoes, and began a Fort, where four hundred Men were left
to guard the Canoes, and the Baggage. Here a young
Cannadian
was shot
to Death, as a Deserter, for conducting the
English
into the Lakes,
though the two Nations were not only at Peace, but their Kings in
stricter Friendship than usual. But this Piece of Severity is not to be
wondered at, when this War was undertaken, chiefly to put a Stop to the

English
Trade, which now began to extend itself far into the
Continent, and would in its Consequence ruin theirs. The next Day the
Army began to march towards the chief Village of the
Senekas
, which
was only seven Leagues distant, every Man carrying ten Biskets for his
Provision. The
Indian
Traders made the Van with Part of the
Indians
,
the other Part marched in the Rear, while the regular Troops and Militia
composed the main Body. The Army marched four Leagues the first Day
without discovering any Thing; the next Day the Scouts advanced before
the Army, as far as the Corn of the Villages, without seeing any Body,
though they passed within Pistol-shot of five-hundred
Senekas
, that
lay on their Bellies, and let them pass and repass without disturbing
them.

On the Report which they made, the
French
hastened their March, in
hopes to overtake the Women, Children, and old Men; for they no longer
doubted of all being fled. But as soon as the
French
reached the Foot
of a Hill, about a Quarter of a League from the Village, the
Senekas

suddenly raised the Warshout, with a Discharge of their Fire-arms. This
put the regular Troops, as well as the Militia, into such a Fright, as
they marched through the Woods, that the Battalions immediately divided,
and run to the Right and Left, and, in the Confusion, fired upon one
another. When the
Senekas
perceived their Disorder, they fell in among
them pell-mell, till the
French Indians
, more used to such Way of
fighting, gathered together and repulsed the
Senekas
. There were
(according to the
French
Accounts) a hundred
Frenchmen
, ten
French
Indians
, and about fourscore
Senekas
killed, in this Rencounter.

Monsieur
de Nonville
was so dispirited with the Fright that his Men
had been put into, that his
Indians
could not persuade him to pursue.
He halted the remainder of that Day. The next Day he marched on with
Design to burn the Village, but when he came there, he found that the

Senekas
had saved him the Trouble; for they had laid all in Ashes
before they retired. Two old Men only were found in the Castle, who were
cut into Pieces and boiled to make Soup for the
French
Allies. The

French
staid five or six Days to destroy their Corn, and then marched
to two other Villages, at two or three Leagues distance. After they had
performed the like Exploits in those Places, they returned to the Banks
of the Lake.

Before the
French
left the Lakes, they built a Fort of four Bastions
at
Oniagara
, on the South-side of the Straights, between Lake
Erie

and
Cadarackui
Lake, and left a hundred Men, with eight Months
Provisions in it. But this Garison was so closely blocked up by the

Five Nations
, that they all died of Hunger, except seven or eight, who
were accidentally relieved by a Party of
French Indians
.

The western
Indians
, when they parted from the
French
General, made
their Harangues, as usual, in which they told him, with what Pleasure
they saw a Fort so well placed to favour their Designs against the
Five
Nations
, and that they relied on his never finishing the War, but with
the Destruction of the
Five Nations
, or forcing them to abandon their
Country. He assured them, that he would act with such Vigour, that they
would soon see the
Five Nations
driven into the Sea.

He sent a Detachment of Soldiers to
Teiodonderaghie
, and in his Return
to
Canada
, which was by the North Side of the Lake, he left a
sufficient Number of Men, and a Quantity of Provisions, at
Cadarackui

Fort.

The
French
having got nothing but dry Blows by this Expedition, sent
thirteen of the
Indians
, that they surprised at
Cadarackui
, to

France
, as Trophies of their Victory, where they were put into the
Galleys, as Rebels to their King.

CHAP. VI.

Colonel
Dongan's
Advice to the
Indians. Adario's
Enterprize
,
and

Montreal
sacked by the
Five Nations.

C
olonel
Dongan
, who had the
Indian
Affairs very much at Heart, met
the
Five Nations
at
Albany
as soon as possible after the
French

Expedition, and spoke to them on the fifth of
August
, in the following
Words,
viz
.

"
Brethren
,

"I am very glad to see you here in this House, and am heartily
glad that you have sustained no greater Loss by the
French
,
though I believe it was their Intention to destroy you all, if
they could have surprised you in your Castles.

"As soon as I heard their Design to war with you, I gave you
Notice, and came up hither myself, that I might be ready to give
all the Assistance and Advice that so short a Time would allow
me.

"I am now about sending a Gentleman to
England
, to the King,
my Master, to let him know, that the
French
have invaded his
Territories on this Side of the great Lake, and warred upon the
Brethren his Subjects. I therefore would willingly know, whether
the Brethren have given the Governor of
Canada
any Provocation
or not; and if they have, how, and in what Manner; because I am
obliged to give a true Account of this Matter. This Business may
cause a War between the King of
England
and the
French
King,
both in
Europe
and here, and therefore I must know the Truth.

"I know the Governor of
Canada
dare not enter into the King of

England
's Territories, in a hostile Manner, without
Provocation, if he thought the Brethren were the King of

England
's Subjects; but you have, two or three Years ago, made
a Covenant-chain with the
French
, contrary to my Command,
(which I knew could not hold long) being void of itself among
the Christians; for as much as Subjects (as you are) ought not
to treat with any foreign Nation, it not lying in your Power,
you have brought this Trouble on your selves, and, as I believe,
this is the only Reason of their falling on you at this Time.

"Brethren, I took it very ill, that after you had put yourselves
into the Number of the great King of
England
's Subjects, you
should ever offer to make Peace or War without my Consent. You
know that we can live without you, but you cannot live without
us. You never found that I told you a Lye, and I offered you the
Assistance you wanted, provided that you would be advised by me;
for I know the
French
better than any of you do.

"Now since there is a War begun upon you by the Governor of

Canada
, I hope without any Provocation by you given, I desire
and command you, that you hearken to no Treaty but by my Advice;
which if you follow, you shall have the Benefit of the great
Chain of Friendship between the great King of
England
and the
King of
France
, which came out of
England
the other Day, and
which I have sent to
Canada
by
Anthony le Junard
. In the
mean Time, I will give you such Advice as will be for your good;
and will supply you with such Necessaries, as you will have Need
of.

"
First
, My Advice is, as to what Prisoners of the
French
you
shall take, that you draw not their Blood, but bring them Home,
and keep them to exchange for your People, which they have
Prisoners already, or may take hereafter.

"
2dly
, That if it be possible, that you can order it so, I
would have you take one or two of your wisest
Sachems
, and one
or two of your
chief Captains
, of each Nation, to be a Council
to manage all Affairs of the War. They to give Orders to the
rest of the Officers what they are to do, that your Designs may
be kept private; for after it comes among so many People, it is
blazed abroad, and your Designs are often frustrated; and those
chief Men should keep a Correspondence with me by a trusty
Messenger.

"
3dly
, The great Matter under Consideration with the Brethren
is, how to strengthen themselves, and weaken their Enemy. My
Opinion is, that the Brethren should send Messengers to the

Utawawas
,
Twihtwies
, and the
farther Indians
, and to send
back likewise some of the Prisoners of these Nations, if you
have any left, to bury the Hatchet, and to make a
Covenant-chain, that they may put away all the
French
that are
among them, and that you will open a Path for them this Way,
they being the King of
England
's Subjects likewise, tho' the
French have been admitted to trade with them; for all that the

French
have in
Canada
, they had it of the great King of

England
; that by that Means they may come hither freely, where
they may have every Thing cheaper than among the
French
: That
you and they may join together against the
French
, and make so
firm a League, that whoever is an Enemy to one, must be to both.

"
4thly
, Another Thing of Concern is, that you ought to do what
you can to open a Path for all the
North Indians
and

Mahikanders
, that are among the
Utawawas
and further
Nations: I will endeavour to do the same to bring them Home;
for, they not daring to return Home your Way, the
French
keep
them there on purpose to join with the other Nations against
you, for your Destruction; for you know, that one of them is
worse than six of the others; therefore all Means must be used
to bring them Home, and use them kindly as they pass through
your Country.

"
5thly
, My Advice further is, that Messengers go, in behalf of
all the
Five Nations
, to the
Christian Indians
at
Canada
,
to persuade them to come Home to their native Country. This will
be another great Means to weaken your Enemy; but if they will
not be advised, you know what to do with them.

"
6thly
, I think it very necessary, for the Brethren's Security
and Assistance, and to the endamaging the
French
, to build a
Fort upon the Lake, where I may keep Stores and Provisions, in
Case of Necessity; and therefore I would have the Brethren let
me know what Place will be most convenient for it.

"
7thly
, I would not have the Brethren keep their Corn in their
Castles, as I hear the
Onondagas
do, but bury it a great Way
in the Woods, where few People may know where it is, for fear of
such an Accident as has happened to the
Senekas
.

"
8thly
, I have given my Advice in your General Assembly by Mr.

Dirk Wessels
, and
Akus
the Interpreter, how you are to
manage your Parties, and how necessary it is to get Prisoners,
to exchange for your own Men that are Prisoners with the

French
; and I am glad to hear that the Brethren are so united,
as Mr.
Dirk Wessels
tells me you are, and that there are no
rotten Members nor
French
Spies among you.

"
9thly
, The Brethren may remember my Advice, which I sent you
this Spring, not to go to
Cadarackui
; if you had, they would
have served you as they did your People that came from hunting
thither; for I told you then, that I knew the
French
better
than you did.

"
10thly
, There was no Advice or Proposition that I made to the
Brethren, all the Time that the Priest lived at
Onondaga
, but
what he wrote to
Canada
, as I found by one of his Letters,
which he gave to an
Indian
to carry to
Canada
, but which was
brought hither; therefore I desire the Brethren not to receive
him or any
French Priest
any more, having sent for
English
Priests
, with whom you may be supplied to your Content.

"
11thly
, I would have the Brethren look out sharp, for Fear of
being surprized. I believe all the Strength of the
French
will
be at their Frontier Places,
viz
. at
Cadarackui
and

Oniagara
, where they have built a Fort now, and at
Trois
Rivieres
,
Montreal
, and
Chambly
.

"
12thly
, Let me put you in Mind again, not to make any
Treaties without my Means, which will be more advantageous for
you, than your doing it by yourselves, for then you will be
looked upon as the King of
England
's Subjects, and let me
know, from Time to Time, every Thing that is done.

"Thus far I have spoken to you relating to the War."

Then he chid them for their Breach of Faith with
Virginia
. He told
them, that he was informed, that last Spring they had killed a fine
Gentleman, with some others; and that a Party of the
Oneydoes
was now
there at the Head of
Tames River
, with Intention to destroy all the

Indians
thereabout. They had taken six Prisoners, whom he ordered them
to bring to him, to be restored; and that for the future they should
desist from doing any Injury to the People of
Virginia
, or their

Indians
, otherwise all the
English
would unite to destroy them. But
at the same time he freed the
Senekas
from any Blame, and commended
them as a brave and honest People, who never had done any Thing contrary
to his Orders, except in making that unlucky Peace with the
French
,
three Years ago.

Lastly
, He recommended to them, not to suffer their People to be drunk
during the War: A Soldier thereby (he said) loses his Reputation,
because of the Advantages it will give the Enemy over him.

This honest Gentleman earnestly pursued the Interest of his Country; but
it seems his Measures were not agreeable to those his Master had taken
with the
French
King; for he had Orders to procure a Peace for the

French
on their own Terms, and was soon after this removed from his
Government. Indeed such an active, as well as prudent Governor of

New-York
, could not be acceptable to the
French
, who had the
universal Monarchy in View, in
America
as well as in
Europe
.

The great Dispute between Coll.
Dungan
and the
French
was in this,
that Coll.
Dungan
would force the
French
to apply to him, in all
Affairs relating to the
Five Nations
, and the
French
would treat
with them independently of the
English
. For this Reason Coll.
Dungan

refused any Assistance to the
French
, till they, by such Application,
should acknowledge the Dependance of the
Five Nations
on the Crown of

England
. But King
James
ordered him to give up this Point; and that
he should persuade the
Five Nations
to send to
Canada
, to receive
Proposals from the
French Governor
; and for this Purpose, forced them
to agree to a Cessation of Arms, till their Deputies should go and
return from
Canada
; and that they should, in the mean Time, deliver up
all the Prisoners they had taken from the
French
; and that no Accident
might prevent this, and blast so favourable an Opportunity of making
Peace to the best Advantage, Monsr.
De Nonville
sent his Orders to all
his Officers in the
Indian
Countries, to observe a Cessation of Arms,
till the Ambassador of the
Five Nations
should meet him at
Montreal
,
as they had given him Reason to expect they would in a little Time, to
conclude the Peace in the usual Form.

In the mean Time,
Adario
, the Chief of the
Deonondadies
, finding
that his Nation was become suspected by the
French
, since the Time
they had shewn so much Inclination to the
English
, when they attempted
to trade at
Missilimakinak
, resolved, by some notable Action against
the
Five Nations
, to recover the good Graces of the
French
.

For this Purpose, he marched from
Missilimakinak
, at the Head of a
Hundred Men; and that he might act with the more Security, he took

Cadarackui
Fort in his Way for Intelligence: The Commandant informed
him, that Monsr.
De Nonville
was in Hopes of concluding a Peace with
the
Five Nations
, and expected their Ambassadors in eight or ten Days
at
Montreal
for that Purpose, and therefore desired him to return to

Missilimakinak
, without attempting any Thing that might obstruct so
good a Design.

The
Indian
being surprised with this News, was under great Concern for
his Nation, which he was afraid would be sacrificed to the
French

Interest, but dissembled his Concern before the
French
Officer. He
went from
Cadarackui
, not to return home as the Commandant thought,
but to wait for the Ambassadors of the
Five Nations
, near one of the
Falls of
Cadarackui
River, by which he knew they must pass. He did not
lurk there above four or five Days, before the Deputies came guarded by
forty young Soldiers, who were all surprised, and killed or taken
Prisoners. As soon as the Prisoners were all secured, the cunning

Deonondadi
told them, "That he having been informed, by the Governor
of
Canada
, that fifty Warriors of their Nation were to pass this Way
about this Time, he had secured this Pass, not doubting of intercepting
them."

The Ambassadors being much surprised at the
French
Perfidy, told

Adario
the Design of their Journey, who, the better to play his Part,
seemed to grow mad and furious, declaring against Monsr.
De Nonville
,
and said he would, some time or other, be revenged of him, for making a
Tool of him, to commit such horrid Treachery. Then looking stedfastly on
the Prisoners (among whom
Dekanefora
was the principal Ambassador)

Adario
said to them, Go, my Brethren, I unty your Bonds, and send you
home again, tho' our Nations be at War: The
French
Governor has made
me commit so black an Action, that I shall never be easy after it, till
the
Five Nations
shall have taken full Revenge.

This was sufficient to persuade the Ambassadors of the Truth of what he
said, who assured him, that he and his Nation might make their Peace
when they pleased.
Adario
lost only one Man on this Occasion, and
would keep a
Satana
Prisoner (adopted into the
Five Nations
) to fill
up his Place. Then he gave Arms, Powder and Ball to the rest of the
Prisoners, to enable them to return.

The Ambassadors were chiefly, if not all,
Onondagas
, and
Oneydoes
,
who had been long under the Influence of the
French
Priests, and still
retained an Affection to them; but this Adventure thoroughly changed
their Thoughts, and irritated them so heartily against the
French
,
that all the
Five Nations
prosecuted the War unanimously.

Adario
delivered the Slave (his Prisoner) to the
French
at

Missilimakinak
, who to keep up the Enmity between the
Deonondadies

and the
Five Nations
, ordered him to be shot to Death.
Adario

called one of the
Five Nations
, who had been long a Prisoner, to be an
Eye Witness of his Countryman's Death, then bid him make his Escape to
his own Country, to give an Account of the
French
Cruelty, from which
it was not in his Power to save a Prisoner, he himself had taken.

This heightned the Rage of the
Five Nations
so, that Monsr.
De
Nonville
's sending to disown
Adario
in this Action, had no Effect
upon them; their Breasts admitted of no Thoughts but that of Revenge. It
was not long before the
French
felt the bloody Effects of this cruel
Passion, for 1200 Men of the
Five Nations
invaded the Island of

Montreal
, when the
French
had no Suspicion of any such Attempt,
while Monsr.
De Nonville
and his Lady were in that Town. They landed
on the South Side of the Island, at
La Chine
, on the 26th of
July

1688, where they burnt and sacked all the Plantations, and made a
terrible Massacre of Men, Women, and Children. The
French
were under
Apprehension of the Town's being attack'd, for which Reason, they durst
not send out any considerable Party to the Relief of the Country, only
once, when the
Indians
had blocked up two Forts, Monsr.
De Nonville

sent out a hundred Soldiers, and fifty
Indians
, to try to bring off
the Men in those Forts. The
French
of this Party were all either taken
or cut to Pieces, except one Soldier, and the commanding Officer, who,
after he had his Thighs broke, was carried off by twelve
Indians
that
made their Escape. There were above a Thousand of the
French
killed at
this Time, and twenty-six were carried away Prisoners, the greatest Part
of which were burnt alive. The
Five Nations
only lost three Men on
this Expedition, that got drunk and were left behind. This, however, did
not satiate their Thirst after Blood, for, in
October
following, they
destroyed likewise all the lower Part of the Island, and carried away
many Prisoners.

The Consequence of these Expeditions were very dismal to the
French
,
for they were forced to burn their two Barks, which they had on

Cadarackui
Lake, and to abandon their Fort there; they designed to
have blown up their Works, when they left that Place; and for that End
left a lighted Match where the Powder lay, but were in such a Fright,
that they durst not stay to see what Effect it had. They went down

Cadarackui
River in seven Birch Canoes; and for greater Security,
travelled in the Night. One of the Canoes, with all the Men in it, were
lost, by their Precipitation, as they passed one of the Falls in that
River. The
Five Nations
hearing the
French
had deserted
Cadarackui

Fort, fifty
Indians
went and took Possession of it, who found the
Match the
French
had left, which had gone out, and twenty eight
Barrels of Powder in the same Place, together with several other Stores.

The News of the Success the
Five Nations
had over the
French
soon
spread itself among all the
Indians
, and put the
French
Affairs
every where into the greatest Disorder.

The
Utawawas
had always shewn an Inclination to the
English
, and
they therefore immediately sent openly four
Sachems
, with three
Prisoners of the
Senekas
, which they had, to assure them, that they
would for ever renounce all Friendship with the
French
, and promised
to restore the rest of the Prisoners. They also included seven Nations,
that lived near
Missilimakinak
, in this Peace.

This put the
French
Commandant there under the greatest Difficulty to
maintain his Post; but there was no Choice, he must stand his Ground,
for the
Five Nations
had cut off all Hopes of retiring.

The
Nepairinians
and
Kikabous
, of all their numerous Allies, only
remained firm to the
French
; every one of the others endeavoured to
gain the Friendship of the
Five Nations
; and would certainly have
done it, by murdering all the
French
among them, had not the Sieur

Perot
, with wonderful Sagacity and eminent Hazard to his own Person,
diverted them.

Canada
was now in a most miserable Condition, for while the greatest
Number of their Men had been employed in the Expedition against the

Five Nations
, and in trading among the far Nations, and making new
Discoveries and Settlements, Tillage and Husbandry had been neglected;
and they lost several Thousands of their Inhabitants, by the continual
Incursions of small Parties, so that none durst hazard themselves out of
fortified Places; indeed, it is hard to conceive what Distress the

French
were then under, for tho' they were every where almost
starving, they could not plant nor sow, or go from one Village to
another for Relief, but with imminent Danger of having their Scalps
carried away by the sculking
Indians
; at last the whole Country being
laid waste, Famine began to rage, and was like to have put a miserable
End to that Colony.

If the
Indians
had understood the Method of attacking Forts, nothing
could have preserved the
French
from an entire Destruction at this
Time; for whoever considers the State of the
Indian
Affairs during
this Period, how the
Five Nations
were divided in their Sentiments and
Measures; that the
Onondagas
,
Cayugas
, and
Oneydoes
, under the
Influence of the
French
Jesuites, were diverted from prosecuting the
War against
Canada
, by the Jesuites cunningly spiriting up those three
Nations against the
Virginia Indians
, and persuading them to send out
their Parties that Way: That the
Senekas
had a War at the same Time
upon their Hands with three numerous
Indian
Nations, the
Utawawas
,

Chicktaghicks
, and
Twihtwies
; and that the Measures the
English

observed all King
James
's Reign, gave the
Indians
rather Grounds of
Jealousy than Assistance: I say, whoever considers all these Things, and
what the
Five Nations
did actually perform, under all these
Disadvantages against the
French
, will hardly doubt, that the
Five
Nations
by themselves were at that Time an Overmatch for the
French

of
Canada
.

THE

P R E F A C E

To the Second Part.

T
he former Part of this History was written at
New-York
in the Year

1727,
on Occasion of a Dispute which then happened, between the
Government of
New-York
and some
Merchants.
The
French
of
Canada
had the
whole Fur Trade with the
Western Indians
in their Hands, and were
supplied with their woollen Goods from
New-York.
Mr.
Burnet,
who took
more Pains to be informed of the Interest of the People he was set over,
and of making them useful to their Mother Country, than Plantation
Governors usually do, took the Trouble of perusing all the Registers of
the
Indian
Affairs on this Occasion. He from thence conceived of what
Consequence the Fur Trade with the
Western Indians
was of to

Great-Britain;
that as the
English
had the Fur Trade to
Hudson's Bay

given up to them, by the Treaty of
Utrecht,
so, by the Advantages which
the Province of
New-York
has in its Situation, they might be able to
draw the whole Fur Trade in the other Parts of
America
to themselves,
and thereby the
English
engross that Trade, and the Manufactories
depending on it
.

For this Purpose he thought it necessary to put a Stop to the Trade
between
New-York
and
Canada,
by which the
French
supplied themselves
with the most valuable and necessary Commodities for the
Indian
Market,
and to set the Inhabitants of this Province on trading directly with the

Indians.
Besides the Consideration of Profit and Gain, he considered
what Influence this Trade had on the numerous Nations of
Indians
living
on the vast Continent of
North-America,
and who surround the
British

Colonies; of what Advantage it might be of, if they were influenced by
the
English
in Case of a War with
France;
and how prejudicial, on the
other Hand, if they were directed by
French
Counsels
.

The Legislature of
New-York
was soon convinced of the Justness of his
Reasoning, and passed an Act, prohibiting the Trade to
Canada,
and for
encouraging the Trade directly with the
Indians.
They were likewise at
the Charge of building a fortified trading House at
Oswego,
on

Cadarackui Lake,
and have ever since maintained a Garison there. As this
Act did in its Consequence take a large Profit from one or two
considerable Merchants, who had the Trade to
Canada,
intirely in their
Hands, they endeavoured to raise a Clamour against it in the Province,
and presented likewise Petitions to the King, in Order to get the Act
repealed. Upon this Occasion Mr.
Burnet
gave me the Perusal of the
Publick Register of
Indian
Affairs, and it was thought the Publication
of the History of the
Five Nations
might be of Use at that Time
.

I shall only add, that Mr.
Burnet's
Scheme has had its desired Effect:
The
English
have gained the Trade which the
French,
before that, had
with the
Indians
to the Westward of
New-York;
and whereas, before that
Time, a very inconsiderable Number of Men were employed in the
Indian

Trade Abroad, now above three hundred Men are employed at the Trading
House at
Oswego
alone; and the
Indian
Trade has since that Time yearly
increased so far, that several
Indian
Nations come now every Summer to
trade there, whose Names were not so much as known by the
English

before
.

This History, from
New-York,
soon went to
England,
and I have been
informed, that a Publication, with a Continuance of that Work, would be
acceptable there. I have the more chearfully complied with this Notice,
because of the War threatened from
France,
believing that a Publication
of this Kind may be useful, whether the present Inquietudes between the
two Nations end in a War or in a Treaty. The
French
have encouraged
several Publications of this Sort at
Paris,
and certainly such may be
more useful in a
British
Government, where the People have so great a
Share in it, than it can be in a
French
Government, intirely directed by
the Will of their Prince
.

I now continue this History to the Peace of
Reswick,
and if I find this
acceptable, and that a farther Continuation of it be desired, I shall,
if my Life and Health be preserved, carry it down farther; but as I have
too much Reason to doubt my own Ability, to give that Pleasure and
Satisfaction which the Publick may expect in Things thus submitted to
their View, I think it not justifiable to trouble them with too much at
once
.

PART II.

The History of the
Five Indian Nations
of
Canada,
from the Time of
the Revolution to the Peace of
Reswick.

CHAP. I.

The State of Affairs in
New-York
and
Canada,
at the Time of the

Revolution
in
Great-Britain.

W
e left the
Five Nations
triumphing over the
French
in
Canada
, and
they almost reduced to Despair. The Revolution, which happened at this
Time in
England
, seemed to be a favourable Conjunction for the
Five
Nations
; the
English
Colonies, by the War at that Time declared
against
France
, becoming Parties in their Quarrel: For one will be
ready to think, that the
Five Nations
being by themselves too powerful
for the
French
, as appears by the preceding Chapter, when these were
assisted by the
Utawawas
,
Quatoghies
,
Twihtwies
,
Chictaghicks
,

Putewatemies
, and all the
Western Indian Nations
, and when the

English
stood neuter; now certainly, when not only all these
Indian
Nations
had made Peace with the
Five Nations
, but the
English

joined with them in the War, the
French
would not be able to stand one
Campaign.

But we shall find what a Turn Affairs took, contrary to all reasonable
Expectations, from the general Appearance of Things, and of what
Importance a resolute wise Governor is to the well-being of a People,
and how prejudicial Divisions and Parties are. For this Reason, it will
be necessary to take a View of the Publick Affairs in the Province of

New-York
, and in
Canada
, at that Time, in order to understand the
true Causes of the Alterations, which afterwards happened in Favour of
the
French
.

The Revolution occasioned as great Divisions and Parties in the Province
of
New-York
, in Proportion to the Number of People, as it did in

Britain
, if not greater. The Governor and all the Officers either fled
or absconded; the Gentlemen of the King's Council, and some of the most
considerable or richest People, either out of Love, or what they thought
Duty, to King
James
, or rather from an Opinion they had that the

Prince of Orange
could not succeed, refused to join in the Declaration
the People made in favour of that Prince, and suffered the
Administration to fall into different Hands, who were more zealous for
the Protestant Interest, and who were joined by the far greatest Number
of the Inhabitants. After the Revolution was established, they that had
appeared so warmly for it, thought that they deserved best of the
Government, and expected to be continued in the Publick Offices; the
others were zealous to recover the Authority they had lost, and used the
most persuasive Means with the Governors for that Purpose, while the
former trusted to their Merit. This begat great Animosities, which
continued many Years. Each Party, as they were at different Times
favoured by several Governors, opposed all the Measures taken by the
other, while each of them were by Turns in Credit with the People or the
Governor, and sometimes even prosecuted each other to Death. The publick
Measures were by these Means perpetually fluctuating, and often one Day
contradictory to what they were the Day before. The succeeding
Governors, finding their private Account in favouring sometimes the one
Party, and at other Times the other, kept up the Animosities all King

William
's Reign, though very much to the publick Prejudice; for each
Party was this while so eager in resenting private Injuries, that they
intirely neglected the publick Good.

The Constitution of Government in the
English Plantations
, where the
Governors have no Salary, but what they can attain with the Consent of
the Assemblies or Representatives of the People, gave Occasion to
imprudent Governors to fall upon these Expedients, as they sometimes
call them, for getting of Money. And a prevailing Faction, knowing for
what Purpose the Governments in
America
were chiefly desired by the

English
Gentlemen, used this great Privilege to tempt a Governor to be
the Head of a Party, when he ought to have been the Head of the
Government. Indeed
New-York
has had the Misfortune, too frequently, to
be under such as could not keep their Passion for Money secret, though
none found it so profitable a Government, as they did who followed
strictly the true Maxims of governing, without making Money the only
Rule of their Actions.

The frequent Changes of Governors were likewise prejudicial to the
publick Affairs. Colonel
Slaughter
, the first Governor after the
Revolution, happened to die soon after his Arrival, when steady, as well
as resolute Measures, were most necessary. But some think, that the
Occasion of all the Misfortunes lay in the Want of Care in the Choice of
Governors, when the Affairs of
America
wanted able Hands to manage
them; they think that the Ministry had the saving of Money chiefly in
View, when, to gratify some small Services, they gave Employments in

America
to those that were not capable of much meaner Offices at Home.
The Opinion the People had of Colonel
Slaughter
's Capacity gave ground
to these Surmises; but, if it was so, it happened to be very ill saved
Money; for the Mismanagements in this Country occasioned far greater
Expence to the Crown afterwards, than would have bought such Gentlemen
handsome Estates, besides the great Losses they occasioned to the
Subjects.

The greatest Number of the Inhabitants of the Province of
New-York

being
Dutch
, still retained an Affection to their Mother Country, and
by their Aversion to the
English
weakened the Administration. The
common People of
Albany
, who are all
Dutch
, could not forbear giving
the
Indians
some ill Impressions of the
English
; for the
Mohawks
,
in one of their publick Speeches, expressed themselves thus: "We hear a

Dutch Prince
reigns now in
England
, why do you suffer the
English

Soldiers to remain in the Fort? put all the
English
out of the Town.
When the
Dutch
held this Country long ago, we lay in their Houses; but
the
English
have always made us lie without Doors." It is true, that
the Plantations were first settled by the meanest People of every
Nation, and such as had the least Sense of any Honour. The
Dutch
first
Settlers, many of them I may say, had none of the Virtues of their
Countrymen, except their Industry in getting Money, and they sacrificed
every Thing, other People think honourable or most sacred, to their
Gain: But I do not think it proper to give particular Instances of this.

The People of
New-England
were engaged in a bloody War at this Time
with the
Owenagungas
,
Ouragies
, and
Ponacoks
, the
Indians
that
lie between them and the
French
Settlements. The
Scahkooks
were
originally Part of these
Indians
. They left their Country about the
Year 1672, and settled above
Albany
, on the Branch of
Hudson's River

that runs towards
Canada
. The People of
New-England
were jealous of
the
Scahkook Indians
, that they remembering the old Difference they
had with the People of
New England
, and the Relation they bore to the

Eastern Indians
, did countenance and assist these
Indians
in the War
against
New England
. They had Reason for these Jealousies, for the

Scahkook Indians
received privately some
Owenagunga
Messengers, and
kept their coming among them secret from the People of
Albany
; and
some
Scahkooks
had gone privately to the
Owenagungas
. They were
afraid likewise, that the
Mohawks
might have some Inclination to
favour those
Indians
, because some of the
Eastern Indians
had fled
to the
Mohawks
, and were kindly received by them, and lived among
them.

Notwithstanding all these Failures of good Policy, in the Government of

New-York
, the
French
had not gained so great Advantages, if they had
not carefully observed a different Conduct, which it is now necessary to
consider.

Canada
was at this Time in a very distressed Condition, the Country
and out Plantations burnt and destroyed, their Trade intirely at a
stand, great Numbers of their People slain, and the remainder in danger
of perishing by Famine, as well as by the Sword of inveterate cruel
Enemies. When such Misfortunes happen to a Country, under any
Administration, though in Truth the Conduct of Affairs be not to be
blamed, it is often prudent to change the Ministers; for the common
People never fail to blame them, notwithstanding their having acted with
the greatest Wisdom, and therefore cannot so soon recover their Spirits,
that are sunk by Misfortunes, as by putting their Affairs into different
Hands.

For these Reasons, it is probable, the
French
King recalled Mr.
de
Nonville
, but rewarded him for his Services, by an honourable
Employment in the Houshold. The Count
de Frontenac
was sent in his
Place. This Gentleman had been formerly Governor of that Country, and
was perfectly acquainted with its Interest; of a Temper of Mind fitted
to such desperate Times, of undaunted Courage, and indefatigable, though
in the sixty-eighth Year of his Age. The Count
de Frontenac
arrived
the second of
October
1689. The Country immediately received new Life
by the Arrival of a Person, of whose Courage and Conduct every one had
entertained a high Opinion. Care was taken to increase this Impression
on the Minds of the People, by making publick Rejoicings with as much
Noise as possible. He wisely improved this new Life, by immediately
entering upon Action, without suffering their Hopes to grow cold. He
staid no longer at
Quebeck
, than was necessary to be informed of the
present State of Affairs, and in four or five Days after his Arrival set
out in a Canoe for
Montreal
, where his Presence was most necessary;
and the Winter was already so far advanced, that the Ice made it
impracticable to go in a larger Vessel. By this the old Gentleman
increased the Opinion and Hopes the People entertained of him, that,
without staying to refresh himself after a fatiguing Sea-Voyage, he
would immediately undertake another, that required all the Vigour and
Heat of Youth to withstand the Inclemencies of the Climate and Season,
and the Difficulty of such a Passage.

When the Count
de Frontenac
came to
Montreal
, he increased the
Admiration the People had of his Vigour and Zeal, by pretending to go to
visit
Cadarackui Fort
, now abandoned, which he had built in the Time
he was formerly Governor. The Clergy and People of
Montreal
came
jointly with stretched out Arms, representing the Danger of such an
Attempt, and the Difficulties and Hardships that would necessarily
attend it, praying him not to expose a Life that was so necessary for
their Safety. He, with seeming Reluctance, yielded to their Intreaties;
I say with seeming Reluctance, for it was inconsistent with his Prudence
really to have such a Design. This Shew of the Governor's offering to go
in Person, animated some of the Gentlemen of the Country, who
voluntarily went in the Winter, with one Hundred
Indian
Traders, to
visit that Fort; and finding it in better Condition than they expected,
by the Report of those who had abandoned it, they staid there, and made
some small Reparations in the Walls, which the
Indians
had thrown
down.

The Count
de Frontenac
brought back with him
Tawerahet
, a
Capiga
Sachem
, one of the thirteen Prisoners that Mr.
de Nonville
took at

Cadarackui
, and sent to
France
. He was in Hopes this
Indian
would
be useful in procuring a Treaty of Peace with the
Five Nations
, for
they had an extraordinary Opinion of
Tawerahet
; and the
French
had
found, by sad Experience, that they could not be Gainers by continuing
the War: For this Purpose the Count used
Tawerahet
with much
Kindness, during his Voyage, and, after he arrived at
Quebeck
, lodged
him in the Castle under his own Roof, and took such Pains with this

Sachem
, that he forgot all the ill Usage he had formerly received.

The
French
had the more Reason to desire a Peace with the
Five
Nations
, because they knew, that they would now certainly have the

English
Colonies likewise upon them; and if the
Five Nations
had
been able to do so much Mischief by themselves alone, they were much
more to be feared, when they would be assisted, in all Probability, with
the Force and Interest of the
English
Colonies.

Four
Indians
of less Note, who were brought back along with

Tawerahet
, were immediately dispatched, in this
Sachem
's Name, to
the
Five Nations
, to inform them of his Return, and of the kind Usage
they had received from the Count
de Frontenac
; and to press them to
send some to visit their old Friend, who had been so kind to them when
he was formerly Governor of
Canada
, and who still retained an
Affection to the
Five Nations
; as appeared by the Kindness
Tawerahet

and they had received from him. This was the only Method left to the

French
of making Proposals of Peace, which it was their Interest by
all Means to procure.

The Governor of
Canada
, as I said, conceived that there was no Way so
proper to keep up the Spirits of the People, who had got new Life by his
Arrival, as by putting them upon Action; and indeed their present
miserable Condition made them forward enough, to undertake the most
desperate Enterprize, when the frequent Incursions of the
Indians
made
it as dangerous to be at Home, as to attack the Enemy Abroad.

For this Purpose he sent out three Parties in the Winter; one was
designed against
New-York
, the other against
Connecticut
, and the
last against
New-England
.

The
Five Nations
followed Colonel
Dungan
's Advice, in endeavouring
to bring off the
Western Indians
from the
French
, and had all the
Success that could be expected, before Mr.
de Frontenac
arrived.

They were overjoyed when they heard, that the
English
had entered into
War with the
French
, and came several Times to
Albany
to know the
Certainty of it, while it was only rumoured about. The People of

Albany
desired them to secure any of the praying
Indians
that should
come from
Canada
, if they found that they were still ruled by the
Priests; but to encourage them, if they came with a Design to return to
their own Country.

The
Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas
, and
Oneydoes
, the twenty seventh of

June
1689, before any Governor arrived, renewed the old Covenant (as
they said) which was first made many Years ago with one
Tagues
, who
came with a Ship into their River. "Then we first became Brethren, said
they, and continued so till last fall, that Sir
Edmond Andross
came
and made a new Chain, by calling us Children; but let us stick to the
old Chain, which has continued from the first Time it was made, by which
we became Brethren, and have ever since always behaved as such.

Virginia, Maryland
, and
New-England
, have been taken into this
silver Chain, with which our Friendship is locked fast. We are now come
to make the Chain clear and bright. Here they
gave two Bevers
."

King
James
, a little before his Abdication, sent over Sir
Edmond
Andross
with arbitrary Powers, and he, in Imitation of the
French
,
changed the Stile of speaking to the
Indians
, of which they were very
sensible.

They discovered a great Concern for their People that were carried to

Canada
; they long hoped (they said) that the King of
England
would
have been powerful enough to deliver them, but now they began to lose
all Hopes of them.

CHAP. II.

A Treaty between the Agents of
Massachuset's Bay, New-Plymouth,
and

Connecticut,
and the
Sachems
of the
Five Nations,
at
Albany,
in
the Year
1689.

A
bout the Beginning of
September
1689, Colonel
John Pynchon
, Major

John Savage
, and Captain
Jonathan Bull
, Agents for the Colonies of

Massachuset's Bay, New-Plymouth
, and
Connecticut
, arrived at

Albany
, to renew the Friendship with the
Five Nations
, and to engage
them against the
Eastern Indians
, who made War on the
English
of
those Colonies, and were supported by the
French
.

The
Five Nations
had received four Messengers from the
Eastern
Indians
, which gave the People of
New-England
some Apprehensions, and
they were therefore desirous to know what Reception these Messengers had
met with.

The
Five Nations
answered by
Tahajadoris
, a
Mohawk Sachem
, on the
twenty fourth of
September
. He made a long Oration, repeating all that
the Agent from
New-England
had said, the Day before, and desired them
to be attentive to the Answer now to be made to them. They commonly
repeat over all that has been said to them, before they return any
Answer, and one may be surprized at the Exactness of these Repetitions.
They take the following Method to assist their Memories: The
Sachem
,
who presides at these Conferences, has a Bundle of small Sticks in his
Hand; as soon as the Speaker has finished any one Article of his Speech,
this
Sachem
gives a Stick to another
Sachem
, who is particularly to
remember that Article; and so when another Article is finished, he gives
a Stick to another to take Care of that other, and so on. In like Manner
when the Speaker answers, each of these has the particular Care of the
Answer resolved on to each Article, and prompts the Orator, when his
Memory fails him, in the Article committed to his Charge.
Tahajadoris

addressing himself to the Agents, said:

"Brethren,

"You are welcome to this House, which is appointed for our
Treaties and publick Business with the Christians; we thank you
for renewing the Covenant-chain. It is now no longer of Iron and
subject to Rust, as formerly, but of pure Silver, and includes
in it all the King's Subjects, from the
Senekas
Country
eastward, as far as any of the great King's Subjects live, and
southward, from
New-England
to
Virginia
. Here he
gave a
Bever
.

"We are glad to hear of the good Success our great King has had
over the
French
by Sea, in taking and sinking so many of their
Men of War. You tell us in your Proposals that we are one
People, let us then go Hand in Hand together, to ruin and
destroy the
French
our common Enemy.
Gives a Bever.

"The Covenant-chain between us is ancient (as you tell us) and
of long standing, and it has been kept inviolably by us. When
you had Wars some time ago with the
Indians
, you desired us to
help you; we did it readily, and to the Purpose; for we pursued
them closely, by which we prevented the Effusion of much of your
Blood. This was a certain Sign that we loved truly and
sincerely, and from our Hearts.
Gives a Belt.

"You advise us to pursue our Enemies, the
French
, vigorously;
this we assure you we are resolved to do to the utmost of our
Power: But since the
French
are your Enemies likewise, we
desire our Brethren of the three Colonies to send us an hundred
Men for the Security of this Place, which is ill provided, in
Case of an Attack from the
French
; the Christians have
Victuals enough for their Entertainment.
Gives one Belt.

"We patiently bore many Injuries from the
French
, from one
Year to another, before we took up the Axe against them. Our
Patience made the Governor of
Canada
think, that we were
afraid of him, and durst not resent the Injuries we had so long
suffered; but now he is undeceived. We assure you, that we are
resolved never to drop the Axe, the
French
never shall see our
Faces in Peace, we shall never be reconciled as long as one

Frenchman
is alive. We shall never make Peace, though our
Nation should be ruined by it, and every one of us cut in
Pieces. Our Brethren of the three Colonies may depend on this.

Gives a Bever.

"As to what you told us of the
Owenagungas
and
Uragees
, we
answer: That we were never so proud and haughty, as to begin a
War without just Provocation. You tell us that they are
treacherous Rogues, we believe it, and that they will
undoubtedly assist the
French
. If they shall do this, or shall
join with any of our Enemies, either
French
or
Indians
, then
we will kill and destroy them.
Gives a Bever.
"

Then the
Mohawks
offered five of their Men, to guard the Agents Home
against any of their
Indian
Enemies, who they were afraid might be
laying in wait for the Agents, and
gave a Belt
.

Afterwards the Speaker continued his Speech, and said: "We have spoke
what we had to say of the War, we now come to the Affairs of Peace: We
promise to preserve the Chain inviolably, and wish that the Sun may
always shine in Peace over all our Heads that are comprehended in this
Chain. We
give two Belts
, one for the Sun, the other for its Beams."

"We make fast the Roots of the Tree of Peace and Tranquillity, which is
planted in this Place. Its Roots extend as far as the utmost of your
Colonies; if the
French
should come to shake this Tree, we would feel
it by the Motion of its Roots, which extend into our Country: But we
trust it will not be in the Governor of
Canada
's Power to shake this
Tree, which has been so firmly and so long planted with us.
Bevers.
"

Lastly
, He desired the Magistrates of
Albany
to remember what he had
said, and
gave them a Bever
.

But the Agents perceiving, that they had not answered any Thing about
the
Owenagunga
Messengers, and had answered indistinctly about the War
with the
Eastern Indians
, desired them to explain themselves fully on
these two Points, about which the Agents were chiefly concerned.

The
Five Nations
answered:

"We cannot declare War against the
Eastern Indians
, for they
have done us no Harm: Nevertheless our Brethren of
New-England

may be assured, that we will live and die in Friendship with
them. When we took up the Axe against the
French
and their
Confederates, we did it to revenge the Injuries they had done
us; we did not make War with them at the Persuasions of our
Brethren here; for we did not so much as acquaint them with our
Intention, till fourteen Days after our Army had begun their
March."

After the Company had separated, the
Sachems
sent to the
New-England

Agents, desiring to speak with them in private; which being granted, the
Speaker said, we have something to tell you, which was not proper to be
spoken openly, for some of our People have an Affection to the

Owenagungas
; and we were afraid, that they would discover or hinder
our Designs.

Now we assure our Brethren, that we are resolved to look on your Enemies
as ours, and that we will first fall on the
Owaragees
[29]
; and then on
the
Owenagungas
, and lastly on the
French
; and that you may be
convinced of our Intention, we design to send five of our young Men
along with our Brethren to
New-England
, to guard them, who have Orders
to view the Country of the
Owaragees
, to discover in what Manner it
can be attacked with the most Advantage. This we always do before we
make an Attempt on our Enemies. In a Word, Brethren, your War is our
War, for we will live and dye with you.

But it is to be observed, that they confirmed nothing relating to these

Indians
, by giving Belts.

It is probable, that the
Sachems
acted with some Art on this Occasion,
for they really had favourable Inclinations towards the
Owenagungas
;
and they had Reason not to increase the Number of their Enemies, by
making War on the
Eastern Indians
, who avoided doing them any Injury.
The People of
Albany
likewise have always been averse to engage our

Indians
in a War with the
Eastern Indians
, lest it should change the
Seat of the War, and bring it to their own Doors.

On the 25th the Magistrates of
Albany
had a private Conference with
the
Sachems
of the
Five Nations
, and desired to know their
Resolutions as to the War with
Canada
, and the Measures they resolved
to follow. In this Conference the
Indians
saw that the People of

Albany
were so much afraid of the
French
, that their Spirits were
sunk under the Apprehensions of the approaching War; and for this Reason
made the following Answer.

"We have a hundred and forty Men out-skulking about
Canada
; it
is impossible for the
French
to attempt any Thing, without
being discovered and harassed by these Parties: If the
French

shall attempt any Thing this Way, all the
Five Nations
will
come to your Assistance, for our Brethren and we are but one,
and we will live and dye together. We have desired a hundred Men
of our Brethren of
Boston
to assist us here, because this
Place is most exposed; but if the Governor of
Canada
is so
strong, as to overcome us all united together, then he must be
our Master, and is not to be resisted; but we have Confidence in
a good and just Cause; for the great God of Heaven knows how
deceitfully the
French
have dealt with us, their Arms can have
no Success. The Great God hath sent us Signs in the Sky to
confirm this. We have heard uncommon Noise in the Heavens, and
have seen Heads fall down upon Earth, which we look upon as a
certain Presage of the Destruction of the
French
: Take
Courage! On this they all immediately joined in singing and
crying out, Courage! Courage!"

CHAP. III.

An Account of a general Council of the
Five Nations
at
Onondaga,
to
consider the Count
De Frontenac'
s Message
.

O
n the 27th of
December
1689, two
Indians
came to
Albany
, being
sent by the
Onondaga
and
Oneydo Sachems
, with seven Hands of Wampum
from each Nation, to tell their Brethren in
New-York
and

New-England
, that three of their old Friends, who had been carried
Prisoners to
France
, were come with Proposals from
Canada
; that
there was a Council of the
Sachems
appointed to meet at
Onondaga
,
and that they therefore desired the Mayor of
Albany
,
Peter Scheyler
,
and some others of their Brethren, to come thither, to be present and to
advise on an Affair of so great Consequence; for they were resolved to
do nothing without the Knowledge and Consent of all those that were
included in the Chain with them.

The same Messenger told them, that some Letters were sent to the Jesuit
at
Oneydo
; and that they would neither burn, nor suffer those Letters
to be opened, till the Brethren should first see them.

All that the Magistrates of
Albany
did on this important Occasion, was
to send three
Indians
with Instructions in their Name, to dissuade the

Five Nations
from entertaining any Thoughts of Peace, or yielding to a
Cessation of Arms.

On the 4th of
January
one of the chief
Mohawk Sachems
came to

Albany
, to tell the
Magistrates
, that he was to go to
Onondaga
,
and desired the Brethren's Advice how to behave there; on which the
Magistrates thought it necessary to send likewise the publick
Interpreter, and another Person to assist at the general Meeting, with
written Instructions; but no Person of Note, that had any Influence on
the
Indians
, went.

When the Messengers arrived at
Oneydo
, they discoursed privately with
one of the Prisoners that had returned from
France
, and found that he
had no Love for the
French
; but it is impossible but that
Indians
,
who had seen the
French
Court, and many of their Troops, must be
surprised at their Grandeur: he complained however of the ill Usage he
had met with. The
French
chose, on this Occasion, to send first to

Oneydo
, because of the Assistance they expected the Jesuit, that
resided there, would give to their Negotiation.

I believe it will not be tedious to the Reader, that desires to know the

Indian Genius
, if I give a circumstantial Account of this general
Council or Parliament of the
Five Nations
, that he may see in what
Manner a People that we call Savages behave on such important Occasions.

On the 22d of
January
the general Council was opened at
Onondaga
,
consisting of eighty
Sachems
; in the first Place
Sadekanaghtie
, an

Onondaga Sachem
, rising up, addressed himself to the Messenger of

Albany
, saying,

Four Messengers are come from the Governor of
Canada
,
viz
. three who
had been carried Prisoners to
France
, and a
Sachem
of the
Praying
Indians
that live at
Montreal
.

The Governor of
Canada
notifies his Arrival to us, that he is the
Count
de Frontenac
, who had been formerly Governor there; that he had
brought back with him
Tawerahet
a
Cayuga Sachem
, and twelve
Prisoners, that had been carried to
France
; then taking the Belt of

Wampum
in his Hand, and holding it by the Middle, he added, what I
have said relates only to one Half of the Belt, the other Half is to let
us know, that he intends to kindle again his Fire at
Cadarackui
next
Spring, and therefore invites his Children, and
Dekanasora
an

Onondaga Captain
in particular, to treat there with him about the old
Chain. Then
Adarahta
the chief
Sachem
of the
praying Indians
stood
up, and said, with three Belts in his Hand, I advise you to meet the
Governor of
Canada
as he desires; agree to this, if you would live,
and
gives one Belt of
Wampum
.

Tawerahet
sends you this other Belt, to inform you of the Miseries,
that he and the rest of your Countrymen have suffered in their
Captivity; and to advise you to hearken to
Yonondio
, if you desire to
live.

This third Belt is from
Thurensera
[30]
,
Ohguesse
[31]
, and

Ertel
[32]
, who say by it, to their Brethren: We have interceded for
you with
Yonondio
, and therefore advise you to meet him at

Cadarackui
in the Spring, because it will be for your Advantage.

When this
Sachem
had done speaking, the
Mohawk
Messenger sent from

Albany
delivered his Message Word for Word, as he had received it,
without omitting the least Article. The Interpreter, while the
Indian

was speaking, read over a Paper, on which the Message was set down, lest
any Thing should have been forgot.

After this
Cannehoot
a
Seneka Sachem
stood up, and gave the general
Council a particular Account of a Treaty made last Summer, between the

Senekas
and the
Wagunha
Messengers, (one of the
Utawawa
Nations)
who had concluded a Peace for themselves, and seven other Nations, to
which the other four Nations were desired to agree, and their Brethren
of
New-York
to be included in it. He said the Proposals made in
several Propositions were as follow.

1. We are come to join two Bodies into one. Delivering up at the same
Time two Prisoners.

2. We are come to learn Wisdom of you
Senekas
, and of the other
Five
Nations
, and of your Brethren of
New-York
.
Giving a Belt.

3. We by this Belt wipe away the Tears from the Eyes of your Friends,
whose Relations have been killed in the War, and likewise
[33]
the Paint
from your Soldiers Faces.
Giving another Belt.

4. We now throw aside the Ax, which
Yonondio
put into our Hands, by
this
third Belt
.

5. Let the Sun, as long as he shall endure, always shine upon us in
Friendship. Here he
gave a red Marble Sun
as large as a Plate.

6. Let the Rain of Heaven wash away all Hatred, that we may again smoke
together in Peace,
giving a large Pipe
of red Marble.

7.
Yonondio
is drunk, but we wash our Hands clean from all his
Actions.
Giving a fourth Belt.

8. Now we are clean washed by the Water of Heaven, neither of us must
defile ourselves by hearkening to
Yonondio
.

9. We have twelve of your Nation Prisoners, who shall be brought home in
the Spring; there he
gave a Belt
, to confirm the Promise.

10. We will bring your Prisoners when the Strawberries shall be in
blossom,
[34]
at which Time we intend to visit
Corlear
, and see the
Place where the Wampum is made. (
New-York
.)

The Speaker added, we will also tell our Friends the other
Utawawa

Nations, and the
Dionondadies
, who have eleven of your People
Prisoners, what we have now done, and invite them to make Peace with
you.

He said further, we have sent three Messengers back with the
Wagunhas
,
in order to confirm this Peace with their Nation.

After the
Seneka
Speaker had done, the
Wagunha
Presents were hung up
in the House, in the Sight of the whole Assembly, and afterwards
distributed among the several Nations, and their Acceptance was a
Ratification of the Treaty. A
large Belt was given
also to the
Albany

Messengers as their Share.

The Belt of Wampum sent from
Albany
was in like Manner hanged up, and
afterwards divided.

New-England
, which the
Indians
call
Kinshon
(that is a Fish) sent
likewise the Model of a Fish, as a token of their adhering to the
general Covenant. This Fish was handed round among the
Sachems
, and
then laid aside to be put up.

After these Ceremonies were over,
Sadekanahtie
, an
Onondaga
Speaker,
stood up, and said, Brethren, we must stick to our Brother
Quider
, and
look on
Yonondio
as our Enemy, for he is a Cheat: By
Quider
they
meant
Peter Schyler
the Mayor of
Albany
, who had gained a
considerable Esteem among them; as they have no Labeals in their
Language, they pronounce
Peter
by the Sound
Quider
.

The Messenger from
Canada
had brought Letters, and some medicinal
Powder, for the Jesuit
Milet
, who resided at
Oneydo
. These Letters
and the Powder were delivered to the Interpreter from
Albany
to be
carried thither, that the Contents of them might be made known to the

Sachems
of the several Nations. The Jesuit was present all this While
in their Council.

Then the Interpreter was desired to speak what he had to say from their
Brethren at
Albany
. He told them, that a new Governor was arrived, who
had brought a great many Soldiers from
England
. That the King of

England
had declared War against
France
, and that the People of

New-England
were fitting out Ships against
Canada
. He advised them,
that they should not hearken to the
French
, for when they talk of
Peace, said he, War is in their Heart, and desired them to enter into no
Treaty but at
Albany
, for the
French
, he said, would mind no
Agreement made any where else.

After this they had Consultations for some Time together, and then gave
the following Answer by their Speaker.

Brethren, our Fire burns at
Albany
. We will not send
Dekanasora
to

Cadarackui
. We adhere to our old Chain with
Corlear
; we will
prosecute the War with
Yonondio
, and will follow your Advice in
drawing off our Men from
Cadarackui
. Brethren, we are glad to hear the
News you tell us, but tell us no Lies.

Brother
Kinshon
, we hear you design to send Soldiers to the eastward
against the
Indians
there; but we advise you, now so many are united
against the
French
, to fall immediately on them. Strike at the Root,
when the Trunk shall be cut down, the Branches fall of Course.

Corlear
and
Kinshon
, Courage! Courage! In the Spring to
Quebeck
,
take that Place, and you'll have your Feet on the Necks of the
French
,
and all their Friends in
America
.

After this they agreed to the following Answer to be sent to the
Governor of
Canada
.

1.
Yonondio
, you have notified your Return to us, and that you have
brought back 13 of our People that were carried to
France
, we are glad
of it. You desire us to meet you at
Cadarackui
next Spring, to treat
of the old Chain; but
Yonondio
, how can we trust you, after you have
acted deceitfully so often? Witness what was done at
Cadarackui
; the
Usage our Messengers met with at
Utawawa
, and what was done to the

Senekas
at
Utawawa
. This was their Answer; however, they sent a Belt
with this, which always shews a Disposition to treat.

2.
Therhansera, Ohguesse
and
Ertel
, do you observe Friendship with
us, if you have not, how come you to advise us to renew Friendship with

Yonondio
, they sent them likewise a Belt?

3.
Tawerahet
, the whole Council is glad to hear, that you are returned
with the other twelve.
Yonondio
, you must send home
Tawerahet
and
the others this very Winter, before Spring, and we will save all the

French
that we have Prisoners till that Time.

4.
Yonondio
, you desire to speak with us at
Cadarackui
: Don't you
know that your Fire there is extinguished? It is extinguished with
Blood, you must send home the Prisoners in the first Place.

5. We let you know that we have made Peace with the
Wagunhas
.

6. You are not to think, that we have laid down the Axe, because we
return an Answer; we intend no such Thing: Our Fair-fighters shall
continue the War till our Countrymen return.

7. When our Brother
Tawerahet
is returned, then will we speak to you
of Peace.

As soon as the Council broke up, their Resolutions were made publick to
all their People, by the
Sachems
of their several Nations.

Two
Sachems
were sent to
Albany
, by their general Council, to inform
their Brethren there of their Resolutions, and to bring back the
Contents of the Letters sent from
Canada
to the Jesuit.

As soon as they arrived, one of the
Mohawks
, that had been sent from

Albany
to the Council, delivered the
Wagunha
Belt, and repeated over
distinctly all the Articles agreed to with that Nation, and referred to
the
Onondaga Speaker
, being one of those sent by the Council of

Albany
, to recite the Answer to the Governor of
Canada
. He rising
up, repeated over the whole as before set down, and added; The
French

are full of Deceit; but I call God to witness, we have hitherto used no
Deceit with them, but how we shall act for the future, Time only can
discover. Then he assured the Brethren, that the
Five Nations
were
resolved to prosecute the War, in Token whereof he presented

Quider
[35]
with a Belt, in which three Axes were represented. Perhaps
by this Representation only three Nations joined in sending it, the

Cayugas
and
Oneydoes
being more under the Influence of the Jesuit

Milet
, who lived among them intirely, according to their Manner of
Life, and was adopted by the
Oneydoes
, and made one of their

Sachems
. The Letters from
Canada
to him were read, they contained
nothing but common News and Compliments.

The
Mohawk
Messengers, that had been sent from
Albany
, had carried
with them Goods to sell at the general Council. This was taken Notice of
at the general Council, and gave the
Indians
a mean Opinion of the
People of
Albany
, and particularly of
Peter Schyler
; for it is
exceedingly scandalous among the
Indians
, to employ a Merchant in
publick Affairs; Merchants, (I mean the Traders with the
Indians
) are
looked upon by them as Liars, and People not to be trusted, and of no
Credit, who by their Thoughts being continually turned upon Profit and
Loss, consider every Thing with that private View. As this made a Noise
at
Albany
, by its giving the Jesuit an Opportunity of setting the
Messengers from
Albany
in an ill Light,
Peter Scheyler
cleared
himself by Oath, of his having any Interest directly or indirectly in
those Goods, and sent a Belt back with his publick Justification. The

Mohawk
Messengers had refused to take the Goods, as being scandalous
to the Business they went on; but were persuaded, by being told that the
Goods belonged to
Quider
.

The Magistrates of
Albany
advised the
Sachems
, to send the Jesuit
Prisoner to
Albany
, where he might be kept securely, without having it
in his Power to do Mischief, but they could not prevail. The
Indians

were resolved to keep all the Means of making Peace in their own Hands.

CHAP. IV.

The
French
surprise
Schenectady.
The
Mohawks
Speech of
Condoleance on that Occasion
.

T
he
Count De Frontenac
being desirous, as before observed, to raise
the drooping Spirits of the
French
in
Canada
, by keeping them in
Action, and engaging the most daring of them, in Enterprizes that might
give Courage to the rest, had sent out three Parties against the

English
Colonies, in Hopes thereby to lessen the Confidence which the

Five Nations
had in the
English
Assistance, now that
England
had
declared War against
France
. The Party sent against
New-York
was
commanded by
Monsr. De Herville
, and was ordered to attempt the
surprising of
Schenectady
, the nearest Village to the
Mohawks
; It
consisted of 150
French Bush-lopers
or
Indian
Traders, and of as
many
Indians
, the most of them
French
Converts from the
Mohawks
,
commonly called the
Praying Indians
, settled at a Place near

Montreal
, called
Cahnuaga
. They were well acquainted with all that
Part of the Country round
Schenectady
; and came in Sight of the Place
the 8th of
February
1689-90.

The People of
Schenectady
were at that Time in the greatest Security,
notwithstanding that they had Information from the
Indians
, of a Party
of
French
, and
French Indians
being upon their March that Way. They
did not think it practicable, in that Season of the Year, while it was
extremely cold, and the whole Country covered with Snow. Indeed

Europeans
will hardly think it possible, that Men could make such a
March through the Wilderness in the severest Frosts, without any
Covering from the Heavens, or any Provision, except what they carried on
their Backs.

Tho' the People of
Schenectady
were informed in the Evening before the
Place was surprised, that several sculking
Indians
were seen near the
Place, they concluded, that they could be only some of the neighbouring

Indians
; and as they had no Officer of any Esteem among them, not a
single Man could be persuaded to watch in such severe Weather, tho', as
the
French
owned afterwards, if they had found the least Guard or
Watch, they would not have attempted the Place, but have surrendered
themselves Prisoners: They were so exceedingly distressed with the
Length of their March, and with Cold, and Hunger, but finding the Place
in fatal Security, they marched into the Heart of the Village, without
being discovered by any one Person; then they raised their War Shout,
entered the Houses, murdered every Person they met, Men, Women, and
Children, naked and in cold Blood; and at the same Time set Fire to the
Houses. A very few escaped, by running out naked into the Woods in this
terrible Weather: And several hid themselves, till the first Fury of the
Attack was over; but these were soon driven from their lurking Places by
the Fire, and were all made Prisoners.

Captain
Alexander Glen
, at this Time, lived at a Distance by himself,
on the other Side of the River, and was the most noted Man in the Place.
He had at several Times been kind to the
French
, who had been taken
Prisoners by the
Mohawks
, and had saved several of them from the Fire.
The
French
were sensible what Horror this cruel sacking of a
defenceless Place, and murdering People in cold Blood, must raise in
Mens Minds; and to lessen this, they resolved to shew their Gratitude to
Captain
Glen
. They had passed his House in the Night, and observing
that he stood on his Defence the next Morning, some of them went to the
River Side, and calling to him, assured him, that they designed him no
Injury. They persuaded him to come to the
French
Officer, who restored
to him all his Relations that were Prisoners.

Some
Mohawks
being also found in the Village, the
French
dismissed
them, with Assurance, that they designed them no Hurt.

This Conduct was not only necessary to promote the Peace which the

Count De Frontenac
with so much Earnestness desired, but likewise to
secure their Retreat, by making the
Mohawks
less eager to pursue them.

The
French
marched back, without reaping any visible Advantage from
this barbarous Enterprize, besides the murdering sixty-three innocent
Persons in cold Blood, and carrying twenty-seven of them away Prisoners.

The Care the
French
took to sooth the
Mohawks
had not intirely it's
Effect, for as soon as they heard of this Action, a hundred of their
readiest young Men pursued the
French
, fell upon their Rear, and
killed and took twenty-five of them.

This Action frightened the Inhabitants in and about
Albany
so much,
that many resolved to desert the Place, and retire to
New-York
. They
were packing up and preparing for this Purpose, when the
Mohawk
Sachems
came to
Albany
to condole, according to their Custom, with
their Friends, when any Misfortune befals them. I shall give their
Speech on this Occasion, as it will be of Use to the Reader, in order to
his forming a true Notion of the
Indian Genius
. They spoke the
twenty-fifth of
March
as follows.

"Brethren, the Murder of our Brethren at
Schenectady
by the

French
grieves us as much, as if it had been done to our
selves, for we are in the same Chain; and no Doubt our Brethren
of
New-England
will be likewise sadly affected with this cruel
Action of the
French
. The
French
on this Occasion have not
acted like brave Men, but like Thieves and Robbers. Be not
therefore discouraged. We
give this Belt

to wipe away your
Tears
.

"Brethren, we lament the Death of so many of our Brethren, whose
Blood has been shed at
Schenectady
. We don't think that what
the
French
have done can be called a Victory, it is only a
farther Proof of their cruel Deceit. The Governor of
Canada

sends to
Onondaga
, and talks to us of Peace with our whole
House, but War was in his Heart, as you now see by woful
Experience. He did the same formerly at
Cadarackui
, and in the

Senekas
Country. This is the third Time he has acted so
deceitfully. He has broken open our House at both Ends, formerly
in the
Senekas
Country, and now here. We hope however to be
revenged of them. One Hundred of our bravest young Men are in
Pursuit of them, they are brisk Fellows, and they will follow
the
French
to their Doors. We will beset them so closely,
that not a Man in
Canada
shall dare to step out of Doors to
cut a Stick of Wood; But now
we gather up our Dead, to bury
them
, by
this second Belt
.

"Brethren, we came from our Castles with Tears in our Eyes, to
bemoan the Bloodshed at
Schenectady
by the Perfidious

French
. While we bury our Dead murdered at
Schenectady
, we
know not what may have befallen our own People, that are in
Pursuit of the Enemy, they may be dead; what has befallen you
may happen to us; and therefore
we come to bury our Brethren
at
Schenectady with
this third Belt
.

"Great and sudden is the Mischief, as if it had fallen from
Heaven upon us. Our Forefathers taught us to go with all Speed
to bemoan and lament with our Brethren, when any Disaster or
Misfortune happens to any in our Chain. Take this Bill of
Vigilance, that you may be more watchful for the future.
We
give our Brethren Eye-Water
to make them sharp sighted,
giving
a fourth Belt
.

"We are now come to the House where we usually renew the Chain;
but alas! we find the House polluted, polluted with Blood. All
the
Five Nations
have heard of this, and we are come to wipe
away the Blood, and clean the House. We come to invite

Corlear
, and every one of you, and
Quider
(calling to every
one of the principal Men present by their Names)
to be revenged
of the Enemy
, by
this fifth Belt
.

"Brethren, be not discouraged, we are strong enough. This is the
Beginning of your War, and the whole House have their Eyes fixed
upon you at this Time, to observe your Behaviour. They wait your
Motion, and are ready to join in any resolute Measures.

"Our Chain is a strong Chain, it is a Silver Chain, it can
neither rust nor be broken. We, as to our Parts, are resolute to
continue the War.

"We will never desist, so long as a Man of us remains. Take
Heart, do not pack up and go away,
[36]
this will give Heart to
a dastardly Enemy. We are of the Race of the Bear, and a Bear
you know never yields, while one Drop of Blood is left.
We must
all be Bears
;
giving a sixth Belt
.

"Brethren be patient, this Disaster is an Affliction which has
fallen from Heaven upon us. The Sun, which hath been cloudy, and
sent this Disaster, will shine again with its pleasant Beams.
Take Courage, said he, Courage, repeating the Word several Times
as they
gave a seventh Belt
.

(
To the
English.)

Brethren, three Years ago we were engaged in a bloody War with the

French
, and you encouraged us to proceed in it. Our Success answered
our Expectation; but we were not well begun, when
Corlear
stopt us
from going on. Had you permitted us to go on, the
French
would not now
have been able to do the Mischief, they have done, we would have
prevented their sowing, planting or reaping.

We would have humbled them effectually, but now we dye. The Obstructions
you then made now ruin us. Let us after this be steady, and take no such
false Measures for the future, but
prosecute the War vigorously
.

Giving a Bever Skin.

The Brethren must keep good Watch, and if the Enemy come again, send
more speedily to us. Don't desert
Schenectady
. The Enemy will glory in
seeing it desolate. It will give them Courage that had none before,

fortify the Place
, it is not well fortified now: The
Stockadoes
are
too short, the
Indians
can jump over them.
Gave a Bever Skin.

Brethren, The Mischief done at
Schenectady
cannot be helped now; but
for the future, when the Enemy appears any where, let nothing hinder
your sending to us by Expresses, and fire great Guns, that all may be
alarmed. We advise you to bring all the
River Indians
under your
Subjection to live near
Albany
, to be ready on all Occasions.

Send to
New-England
, tell them what has happened to you. They will
undoubtedly awake and lend us their helping Hand. It is their Interest,
as much as ours, to push the War to a speedy Conclusion. Be not
discouraged, the
French
are not so numerous as some People talk. If we
but heartily unite to push on the War, and mind
our Business, the

French
will soon be subdued
.

The Magistrates having returned an Answer on the twenty seventh, to the
Satisfaction of the
Indians
, they repeated it all over, Word by Word,
to let the Magistrates see how carefully they minded it, and then added,

Brethren, we are glad to find you are not discouraged. The best and
wisest Men sometimes make Mistakes. Let us now pursue the War
vigorously. We have a hundred Men out, they are good Scouts. We expect
to meet all the
Sachems
of the other Nations, as they come to condole
with you. You need not fear our being ready, at the first Notice. Our Ax
is always in our Hands, but take Care that you be timely ready. Your
Ships, that must do the principal Work, are long a fitting out. We do
not design to go out with a small Company, or in sculking Parties; but
as soon as the Nations can meet, we shall be ready with our whole Force.
If you would bring this War to a happy Issue, you must begin soon,
before the
French
can recover the Losses they have received from us,
and get new Vigour and Life, therefore send in all Haste to

New-England
. Neither you nor we can continue long in the Condition we
are now in, we must order Matters so, that the
French
be kept in
continual Fear and Alarm at home; for this is the only Way to be secure,
and in Peace here.

The
Scahkok Indians
, in our Opinion, are well placed where they are
(to the Northward of
Albany
); they are a good Out-guard; they are our
Children, and we shall take Care that they do their Duty: But you must
take Care of the
Indians
below the Town, place them nearer the Town,
so as they may
be of most Service to you
.

Here we see the
Mohawks
acting like hearty Friends, and if the Value
of the Belts given at that Time be considered, together with what they
said on that Occasion, they gave the strongest Proofs of their
Sincerity. Each of these Belts amount to a large Sum in the
Indian

Account.

The
English
of
New-York
and the
French
of
Canada
were now
entering into a War, in which the Part the
Five Nations
are to take is
of the greatest Consequence to both; the very Being of the
French

Colony depended on it, as well as the Safety of the
English
. The

Indians
at this Time had the greatest Aversion to the
French
, and
they desired nothing so much, as that the
English
might join heartily
in this War. We shall see by the Sequel how a publick Spirit, directed
by wise Counsels, can overcome all Difficulties, while a selfish Spirit
loses all, even natural Advantages. In the present Case, the Turn Things
took seems to have been entirely owing to one Thing. The French in
making the Count
de Frontenac
Governor of
Canada
, chose the Man
every Way the best qualified for this Service: The
English
seemed to
have little Regard to the Qualification of the Person they sent, but to
gratify a Relation or a Friend, by giving him an Opportunity to make a
Fortune; and as he knew that he was recommended with this View, his
Counsels were chiefly employed for this Purpose.

By this Means an
English Governor
generally wants the Esteem of the
People; while they think that a Governor has not the Good of the People
in View, but his own, they on all Occasions are jealous of him; so that
even a good Governor, with more Difficulty, pursues generous Purposes
and publick Benefits, because the People suspect them to be mere
Pretences to cover a private Design. It is for this Reason, that any
Man, opposing a Governor, is sure to meet with the Favour of the People,
almost in every Case. On the other Hand, the Opinion the
French
had of
the Count
de Frontenac
's publick Spirit, and of his Wisdom and
Diligence, made them enter into all his Measures without hesitating, and
chearfully obey all his Commands.

CHAP. V.

The
Five Nations
continue the War with the
French;
the
Mohawks

incline to Peace
;
their Conferences with the
Governor
of
New-York.

T
he
Governor
of
Canada
received Hopes that the
Five Nations

inclined to Peace, by their returning an Answer to
Therawaet
's
Message, and thought he might now venture to send some
French
to them
with further Proposals. The Chevalier
D'O
, with an Interpreter called

Collin
, and some others, went; but they had a much warmer Reception
than they expected, being forced to run the Gauntlet through a long Lane
of
Indians
, as they entered their Castle, and were afterwards
delivered up Prisoners to the
English
.

The
Five Nations
kept out at this Time small Parties, that continually
harassed the
French
. The Count
de Frontenac
sent Captain
Louvigni

to
Missilimakinak
, to relieve the Garison, and he had Orders, by all
Means, to prevent the Peace which the
Utawawas
and
Quatoghies
were
upon the Point of concluding with the
Five Nations
. He carried with
him one hundred forty three
French
, and six
Indians
, and was
likewise accompanied with a Lieutenant and thirty Men, till he got one
hundred twenty Miles from
Montreal
. They were met in
Cadarackui
River
, at a Place called the
Cats
, by a Party of the
Five Nations
,
who fell vigorously on their Canoes, killed several of the
French
, and
made them give Way; but
Louvigni
, by putting his Men ashore, at last
got the better, after a smart Engagement, in which the
Indians
had
several Men killed, and two Men, and as many Women, taken Prisoners. I
am obliged to rely on the
French
Account of these Skirmishes; they do
not mention the Number of the
Indians
in this Rencounter, but I
suspect them to have been much fewer than the
French
; for when the
Enemy are equal in Number, or greater, they seldom forget to tell it.
One of the
Indian
Prisoners was carried by them to
Missilimackinak
,
to confirm this Victory, and was delivered to the
Utawawas
, who eat
him. The Lieutenant carried the other back with him. He was given to

Therawaet
.

To revenge this Loss, the
Five Nations
sent a Party against the

Island of Montreal
, who fell on that Part called the
Trembling
Point
; and though they were discovered before they gave their Blow,
they attacked a Party of regular Troops, and killed the commanding
Officer, and twelve of his Men: Another Party carried off fifteen or
sixteen Prisoners from
Riviere Puante
, over against
Trois Rivieres
.
This Party was pursued, and finding that they were like to be
overpowered, murdered their Prisoners and made their Escape. These
Incursions kept all the River, from
Montreal
to
Quebeck
, in
continual Alarm, and obliged the Governor to send all the Soldiers to
guard the south Side of the River. Notwithstanding this, five Persons
were carried away in Sight of
Sorel Fort
, by a small skulking Party,
but they were soon afterwards recovered by the Soldiers. About the same
Time another Party burnt the Plantations at
St. Ours
.

The
Five Nations
had conceived great Hopes from the Assistance of the

English
, as the Magistrates of
Albany
had promised the
Mohawks
,
when they came to condole, after the surprising of
Schenectady
; but
the
English
were so far from performing these Promises, that many of
the Inhabitants retired from
Albany
to
New-York
; and they who had
the Administration of Affairs, were so intent on their party Quarrels,
that they intirely neglected the
Indian
Affairs. Indeed the People of

New-York
have too often made large Promises, and have thereby put the

Indians
upon bold Enterprizes, when no Measures were concerted for
supporting them. This made the
Indians
think, that the
English
were
lavish of
Indian
Lives and too careful of their own. The
Mohawks
,
who lived nearest the
English
, were most sensible of these Things, and
soon entertained Notions prejudicial to the Opinion they ought to have
had of the
English
Prudence and Conduct; it is even probable, these

Indians
began to entertain a mean Opinion of both the
English

Courage and Integrity. It is not strange then, that the
Mohawks
at
last gave Ear to the assiduous Application of their Countrymen, the

praying Indians
, who, with
French
Arguments, persuaded them to make
Peace as soon as possible, without trusting longer to the
English
, who
had so often disappointed or deceived them.

The
Mohawks
sent one of their
Sachems
,
Odigacege
, to the
praying
Indians
, who introduced him to the Count
de Frontenac
. The Count made
him welcome, and told him, that he was sorry for the Injuries his
Predecessors had done them; but that he would treat them like Friends,
if their future Conduct did not prevent him, and
gave him a Belt
, with
Proposals of Peace to his Nation.

Colonel
Slaughter
, who was then Governor of
New-York
, being
informed that the
Five Nations
were like to make Peace with the

French
, by their having lost much of their Confidence in the
English

Assistance, found it necessary to meet them, which he did in the End of

May
1691. There were present at that Time six
Oneydo
, eleven

Onondaga
, four
Cayuga
, and ten
Seneka Sachems
. He renewed the
Covenant with them, and gave them Presents. The
Mohawks
having entered
into a Treaty with the
French
, did not join with the other four
Nations in their Answer.

On the second of
June
the Speaker, in Name of the other four Nations,
told him, they were glad to see a Governor again in this Place; that
they had learned from their Ancestors, that the first Ship which arrived
in this Country surprized them exceedingly; that they were curious to
know what was in its huge Belly. They found Christians in it, and among
them one
Jacques
, with whom they made a Chain of Friendship, which has
been preserved to this Day. By that Chain it was agreed, that whatever
Injury was done to the one, should be deemed, by both Sides, as likewise
done to the other. Then they mentioned the Confusion that had lately
been in the Government of
New-York
, which had like to have confounded
all their Affairs, but hoped all would be reduced to their wonted Order
and Quiet. They complained of several of the Brethren leaving
Albany

in Time of Danger, and praised those by Name who staid, and then said:
Our Tree of Peace, which grows in this Place, has of late been much
shaken, we must now secure and fasten its Roots; we must frequently
manure and dress it, that its Roots may spread far.

They assured the Governor, that they were resolved to prosecute the War
against the
French
as long as they lived, and that they would never
speak of Peace, but with the common Consent. They abhor those that do
otherwise, and desired that the Brethren might not keep a
Correspondence with
Canada
by Letters. You need not (said they) press
us to mind the War, we mind it above all Things; do you but your Parts,
lay aside all other Thoughts but that of the War, for it is the only
Thing we have at Heart. They
gave Bevers
at the End of every distinct
Part of their Answer.

On the fourth the
Mohawks
spoke to the Governor, in Presence of the
other four Nations: They confessed the Negotiations they had with the

Praying Indians
, and with the Governor of
Canada
, and that they had
received a Belt from him. Then they restored one of the Prisoners taken
at
Schenectady
, as the Fruit of that Negotiation. They desired the
Governor's Advice, and the Advice of the whole House, what Answer to
return to the Governor of
Canada
; and lastly, desired the
Senekas
to
release the Prisoners they had taken from the
Praying Indians
.

Colonel
Slaughter
check'd the
Mohawks
for entering into a separate
Treaty with the Enemy, and said he could admit of no Proposals of Peace.
He told them, that the Prisoners taken from the
Praying Indians
must
not be restored; putting them in mind, that some of them having been
formerly released, soon after returned and murdered several People, and
burnt several Houses.

He assured them of his Assistance, and then added, You must keep the
Enemy in perpetual Alarm. The
Mohawks
thanked him for his Assurance of
Assistance; but took Notice of his saying,
You
must keep the Enemy in
perpetual Alarm. Why don't you say, they replied, We will keep the Enemy
in perpetual Alarm. In the last Place, the
Mohawks
renewed their
League with all the
English
Colonies; adding, Though an angry Dog has
endeavoured to bite the Chain in Pieces, we are resolved to keep it
firm, both in Peace and in War: We now renew the old Chain, that so the
Tree of Peace and Prosperity may flourish, and spread its Roots through
all the Country.

In the last Place, the four Nations answered the
Mohawks
.

"
Mohawks
, our Brethren, in answer to your Proposals from the
Governor of
Canada
, we must put you in Mind of his Deceit and
Treachery; we need only give one recent Instance, how he lately
sent to the
Senekas
to treat of Peace, and at the same Time
fell upon
Schenectady
, and cut that Place off. We tell you,
that the Belt sent by the
French
Governor is Poison; we spew
it out of our Mouths, we absolutely reject it, and are resolved
to prosecute the War as long as we live."

Then they left the Belt lying on the Ground.

CHAP. VI.

The
English
attack
Montreal
by Land
,
in Conjunction with the

Indians,
and
Quebeck
by Sea
.

I
t was now evident that the
Indians
could no longer be amused with
Words, and that, unless the
English
entered soon upon Action, the

French
would carry their Design of making Peace with the
Five
Nations
, and the
English
be left to carry on the War in
America
by
themselves. Certainly a more proper Opportunity of doing it with Success
could not be expected, than at present, while the
French
in
Canada

had neither recovered their Spirits, nor the Strength they had lost, by
the terrible Incursions of the
Five Nations
. A joint Invasion on

Canada
was concerted with
New-England
, they were to attack

Quebeck
by Sea, while
New-York
attacked
Montreal
by Land. The
Governor therefore proposed to the
Indians
to join with him in
attacking
Canada
, for which Purpose he told them, that he designed to
send a considerable Force this Summer. They desired Time to consult on
it at their general Meeting, which was soon to be held at
Onondaga
,
and to know what Number of Christians he designed to send, that they
might join a suitable Number of their Men. To this the Governor
answered, that he must not communicate the Particulars of his Design to
so many, because they could not then be kept secret from the Enemy; as
he found by the Discoveries that were last Year made to the
French
by
that Means.

It was at last agreed, that the
Mohawks
should join with the
Christians that were to march from
New-York
directly against

Montreal
, and that the other four Nations should send a considerable
Party down
Cadarackui Lake
, and join them before
Montreal
.

Major
Peter Schuyler
, the same whom the
Indians
call
Quider
,
commanded the Party sent from
New-York
, which consisted of three
hundred Men, one half Christians, the other
Mohawks
and
Scahkook
Indians
. He set out from
Albany
about Midsummer. As he was preparing
his Canoes to pass
Corlear
's Lake, he was discovered by the
French
Indians
, who immediately returned to
Montreal
, to give Information of
what they had seen. The Chevalier
Clermont
was sent out to make
further Discoveries: He found the
English
above
Chamblie
, and went
immediately back with the Intelligence he there gained. In the mean
while Mr.
de Callieres
, Governor of
Montreal
, did all in his Power
to give Major
Schuyler
a proper Reception, by drawing the Militia and
regular Troops together for the Defence of the Place. There happened to
be a very considerable Number of
Utawawas
trading at that Time at

Montreal
, Mr.
de Colliere
, in Order to engage them to join him, made
a great Feast for them, went among them, and, after the
Indian
Manner,
began the war Song, leading up the Dance with his Axe in his Hand, and
shouting and hollowing in the same wild Manner the
Indians
do. This
done, he carried his whole Force, which consisted of twelve hundred Men,
cross the River, and encamped on the south Side, at
la Prairie de la
Magdeleine
, together with a great Number of
Utawawas
, the
Praying
Indians
, and other
French Indians
. The famous
Therawaet
being now
entirely gained by the Caresses of the Count
de Frontenac
, made one of
the Number. They encamped round the Fort, which stood on a steep rising
Ground between two Meadows.

Major
Schuyler
having left forty of his Men to guard his Canoes, which
had carried him cross the Lake, marched on without stopping. He got into
a Hollow, which led into the Meadow, without being discovered; and
marching under that Cover, he fell suddenly upon the Militia, who were
soon put into Confusion, and many of them, and of the
Utawawas
, who
were posted with them, were killed. He pursued them as they fled to the
Fort, which he attacked briskly, but was obliged to leave it, by the
Approach of the regular Troops who came to relieve it. He received them
however bravely, and, after they had lost several Officers and many Men,
they retired. Major
Schuyler
finding the Number of the Enemy much
greater than was expected, and being informed that a considerable Party
of the Enemy had marched Southward, he began to apprehend, that this
Party was sent to cut off his Retreat, by destroying his Canoes. It was
resolved therefore immediately to follow this Party; he overtook them,
and they covering themselves behind some large fallen Trees, he attacked
them, and made his Way through them, but with considerable Loss.

In this Attack the
Mohawks
signalized themselves, but the
Scahkook
Indians
did not behave themselves well. The
Mohawks
, upon no
Occasion, yielded an Inch of Ground, till the
English
first gave Way.
The
French
, by their own Accounts, lost, in the several Attacks made
by
Schuyler
, two Captains, six Lieutenants, and five Ensigns, and, in
all, three hundred Men, so that their Slain were in Number more than
Major
Schuyler
had with him. The
Mohawks
suffered much, having
seventeen Men killed, and eleven wounded. They returned to
Albany
the
eleventh of
August
.

After the
English
under Major
Schuyler
had retired, an
Owenagunga
Indian
came from
New-England
, with an Account of the Preparations
made there against
Canada
, and that they had actually sailed.

This Fleet, which was commanded by
Sir William Phips
, was discovered
in
St. Laurence Bay
, while the Count
de Frontenac
remained at

Montreal
; and thereupon he made all possible Haste to
Quebeck
, and
carried three hundred Men with him.

The Fleet, which consisted of thirty Sail, did not reach
Quebeck
till
the seventh of
October
. Sir
William
spent three Days in nothing but
Consultation, while the
French
made all possible Preparation for a
Defence, and, by this Means, suffered them to get over the Fright and
Consternation, into which the first Appearance of the Fleet had thrown
them; for the Place was not in any Posture of Defence. It gave them Time
likewise to draw all the Country round them into the Town. And on the
fourth Day Sir
William
summoned the
Count
to surrender, who returned
him such an Answer as his Conduct deserved.

The
English
landed four Miles below the Town, and had thick Woods to
march through, before they could come at it, in which Ambuscades of

French
and
Indians
were made at proper Distances, by whom the

English
were repulsed with considerable Loss. They attempted the Wood
again the next Day with no better Success.

The
French
, in their Account of this Action, say, that the Men, though
they appeared to be as little disciplined as Men could be, behaved with
great Bravery, but that Sir
William
's Conduct was such, that, if he
had been in Concert with them, he could not have done more to ruin the
Enterprize; yet his Fidelity was never suspected. In short, this Descent
was so ill managed, that the
English
got on Board again in the Night,
with the Loss of all the Cannon and Baggage which they had landed.

The
French
thought themselves in such great Danger at that Time, that
they attributed their Deliverance to the most immediate Protection of
Heaven, in confounding the Devices of their Enemy, and by depriving them
of common Sense; and for this Reason the People of
Quebeck
make an
annual Procession, in Commemoration of this Deliverance.

Sir
William
cannonaded the Town for some Time with little Execution,
and then returned in Hast, Winter approaching; indeed that Season was
already so far advanced, that he lost eight Vessels in his Return.

The
Five Nations
continued their Incursions all along
St. Laurence
River
, from
Montreal
to
Quebeck
, and carried away many Scalps. At
one Time a
French
Officer, with thirty eight Men, surprised some of
the
Five Nations
in a Cabin, which they had built near
Lake St.
Piere
. Some of them escaped and informed two other Cabins, which the

French
had not discovered, and they returned with their Companions,
and killed the Captain and Lieutenant, and one half of the Men.

Notwithstanding that the
French
preserved their Country, these
warlike Expeditions, and the Necessity they were under of being on their
Guard, prevented their cultivating the Ground, or of reaping the Fruit
of what they had sowed or planted. This occasioned a Famine in
Canada
,
and, to increase the Misery of the poor Inhabitants, they were forced to
feed the Soldiers gratis, while their own Children wanted Bread.

In
October
the
Onondagas
,
Cayugas
, and
Oneydoes
came to

Albany
, to condole with the
English
, for the Men lost in the
Expedition against
Montreal
, as they had already done with the

Mohawks
. They said it was ever their Custom to condole with their
Friends when they lost any Number of Men in Battle, though they had the
Victory. They at the same Time, as they had often done before,
complained of the Dearness of Powder: Why, say they, do you call us your
King's Soldiers, when you will not sell us Powder at the usual and
reasonable Rates?

And in answer to a Complaint, of there not being a sufficient Number of

English
sent against
Montreal
, the People of
Albany
upbraided them
with a Breach of Promise, in not sending that Party down
Cadarackui
River
which they promised, which they said was the chief Reason of the
want of Success in that Expedition.

CHAP. VII.

The
French
and the
Five Nations
continue the War all Winter with
various Success
.
The
French
burn a
Captain
of the
Five Nations

alive
.

T
he old
French
Governor kept up his Vigour and Spirits wonderfully, no
Fatigue made him ever think of Rest. He knew of what Use it would be to
convince the
Five Nations
, that the joint Attack of the
English
and

Indians
had neither weakened him, nor frightened him from carrying on
the War with as much Vigour as before.

It was absolutely necessary that the
Utawawas
and other
Western
Indians
, who came to
Montreal
to trade, should return safe to their
own Country, otherwise there would be an End to the
French
Trade with
those Nations, upon which the Being of
Canada
depends; for it is only
by the
Fur-trade
with these Nations that they make Returns to

Europe
; and if these Nations did not return in Time, all the
Western
Indians
would look on the
French
as lost, and consequently would make
Peace with the
Five Nations
, and perhaps join in the Destruction of

Canada
.

Captain
la Forest
, with one hundred and ten Men, was sent to conduct
the
Utawawas
Home; he carried with him considerable Presents sent by
the King of
France
, to confirm these Nations in the
French
Interest.

Two
Indian
Prisoners, taken at
la Prairie
, were given to the

Utawawas
, and carried with them, to confirm the Stories they were to
tell of their Successes against the
English
and
Five Nations
. These
poor Men were there burnt alive; and if I should add, that it was done
by
French
Instigation, what I shall relate by and by will clear me of
the want of Charity. I believe it was so, in Order to rivet the Hatred
between these People and the
Five Nations
.

The
Five Nations
continued their Incursions all Winter on
Canada
.
Forty of the
Mohawks
fell upon
Fort Vercheres
, and carried off
twenty of the Inhabitants; but the Alarm reaching
Montreal
, Mr.
de
Crizaei
, with one hundred Men of the regular Troops, was sent in
pursuit of them, who recovered most of the Prisoners.

The Count
de Frontenac
being informed, that a considerable Party of
the
Five Nations
hunted Bever on the Neck of Land between
Cadarackui
Lake
and
Lake Erie
, with great Security, resolved to give them a
better Opinion of the Strength and Courage of the
French
. For this
Purpose he sent three hundred and twelve Men to surprise them, under the
Command of Mr.
Beaucour
, a young Gentleman. The
Praying Indians
of

Montreal
were of the Party. This Expedition being in the Winter, they
were obliged to undergo cruel Fatigues, while they marched on the Snow
with snow Shoes, and carried all their Provision on their Backs. Several
of the
French
had their Feet frozen, which obliged fifteen to return,
with some old
Indians
, that could not bear the Fatigue; and it was
with much Difficulty that
Beaucour
could persuade the rest to continue
their March. After a March to a surprizing Distance, at that Season of
the Year, they surprised eighty of the
Five Nations
, who
notwithstanding made a brave Defence, and did not run before they left
most of their Men dead on the Spot. Three Women were made Prisoners,
with whom the
French
immediately turned back to
Montreal
. Some
stragling Parties went towards
Albany
, but did no more Mischief than
killing two or three stragling Persons, and alarming the Country.

The Trade to
Missilimakinak
being still intirely stopt, by the Parties
of the
Five Nations
investing
Cadarackui River
, by which, and

Cadarackui Lake
, the Passage in Canoes is made to the
Western
Indians
, Captain
la Noue
, with a Command of the regular Troops, was
ordered early in the Spring to guard the Traders through that Passage;
but when he reached the
Falls de Calumette
, he discovered the Enemy,
and returned faster than he went.

La Noue
had Orders a second Time to attempt this Passage, and went as
far as the River
du Lievre
(thirty Leagues from
Montreal
) without
any Obstruction; but there discovering several Canoes of the
Five
Nations
, he went back as fast as before.

The
Quatoghies
and the
Bullheads
[37]
having informed the
French
of
another smaller River, which falls into
Cadarackui River
, and runs to
the Northward of it, by which a Passage might be made to the Lakes, it
was resolved to attempt this Passage, though it were much farther round,
and more dangerous, there being many more rapid Falls in that River.
Three Officers, with thirty Soldiers, were sent with the Traders for
this Purpose, but a Party of the
Five Nations
meeting with them in the
long Fall, before they reached this River, they were all killed or
taken, except four that escaped back to
Montreal
.

A considerable Party of the
Five Nations
, under the Command of

Blackkettle
, a famous Hero, continued a long Time on
Cadarackui
River
, in hopes of meeting with other
French
Parties, in their
Passage towards
Missilimakinak
; but finding that no Attempts were made
that Way, he resolved to make an Irruption into the Country round

Montreal
. The
French
say he had six hundred Men with him; but they
usually increase the Number of their Enemies, in the Relation they give
of these Transactions, either to excuse their Fears, or to increase
their Glory.

Blackkettle
overrun the Country (to use the
French
Expression) as a
Torrent does the Low-lands, when it overflows its Banks, and there is no
withstanding it. The Soldiers had Orders to stand upon the defensive
within their Forts. Mr.
de Vaudreuil
pursued this Party (after they
had burnt and ravaged the whole Country) at the Head of four hundred
Men; he overtook them and surprised them. The
Five Nations
fought
desperately, though the same Author, at this Place, makes them no more
than two hundred Men. After they had lost twenty Men on the Spot, they
broke through the
French
, and marched off. The
French
lost four
Officers and many common Soldiers, and they took five Men, nine Women,
and five Children Prisoners.

The
Five Nations
in a few Days had however some Revenge; a Captain
having had Orders to guard the Vessels from
Montreal
to
Quebeck
, a
Party of the
Five Nations
attacked him in his Return, as he passed
through the Islands in
Lake St. Pierre
. He himself was killed, and the
whole Party intirely routed.

The
French
all this Summer were obliged to keep upon the defensive
within their Forts, while the
Five Nations
, in small Parties, ravaged
the whole Country, so that no Man stirred the least Distance from a
Fort, but he was in danger of losing his Scalp.

The Count
de Frontenac
was pierced to the Heart, when he found that he
could not revenge these terrible Incursions of the
Five Nations
; and
his Anguish made him guilty of such a Piece of monstrous Cruelty, in
burning a Prisoner alive after the
Indian
Manner, as though I have
frequently mentioned to have been done by the
Indians
, yet I forbore
giving the Particulars of such barbarous Acts, suspecting it might be
too offensive to Christian Ears, even in the History of Savages. Here
however I think it useful to give a circumstantial Account of this
horrid Act, to shew on one Hand, what Courage and Resolution, Virtue,
the Love of Glory, and the Love of one's Country can instill into Mens
Minds, even where the Knowledge of true Religion is wanting; and on the
other Hand, how far a false Policy, under a corrupt Religion, can debase
even great Minds.

The Count
de Frontenac
, I say, condemned two Prisoners of the
Five
Nations
to be burnt publickly alive. The Intendant's Lady intreated
him to moderate the Sentence, and the Jesuits, it is said, used their
Endeavours for the same Purpose. But the Count
de Frontenac
said,
there is a Necessity of making such an Example, to frighten the
Five
Nations
from approaching the Plantations, since the Indulgence, that
had hitherto been shewn, had incouraged them to advance with the
greatest Boldness to the very Gates of their Towns; while they thought
they run no other Risque, but of being made Prisoners, where they live
better than at Home. He added, that the
Five Nations
having burnt so
many
French
, justified this Method of making Reprizals. But with
Submission to the Politeness of the
French
Nation, may I not ask,
whether every (or any) horrid Action of a barbarous Enemy, can justify a
civilized Nation in doing the like?

When the Governor could not be moved, the Jesuits went to the Prison, to
instruct the Prisoners in the Mysteries of our Holy Religion,
viz
. of
the Trinity, the Incarnation of our Saviour, the Joys of Paradise, and
the Punishments of Hell, to fit their Souls for Heaven by Baptism, while
their Bodies were condemned to Torments. But the
Indians
, after they
had heard their Sentence, refused to hear the Jesuits speak, and began
to prepare for Death in their own Country Manner, by singing their Death
Song.

Some charitable Person threw a Knife into the Prison, with which one of
them dispatched himself: The other was carried out to the Place of
Execution by the Christian
Indians
of
Loretto
, to which he walked,
seemingly, with as much Indifference as ever Martyr did to the Stake.
While they were torturing him, he continued singing, that he was a
Warrior brave and without Fear; that the most cruel Death could not
shake his Courage; that the most cruel Torment should not draw an
indecent Expression from him; that his Comrade was a Coward, a Scandal
to the
Five Nations
, who had killed himself for fear of Pain; that he
had the Comfort to reflect, that he had made many
Frenchmen
suffer as
he did now. He fully verified his Words, for the most violent Torment
could not force the least Complaint from him, though his Executioners
tried their utmost Skill to do it. They first broiled his Feet between
two red hot Stones; then they put his Fingers into red hot Pipes, and
though he had his Arms at Liberty, he would not pull his Fingers out;
they cut his Joints, and taking hold of the Sinews, twisted them round
small Bars of Iron. All this while he kept singing and recounting his
own brave Actions against the
French
. At last they flead his Scalp
from his Skull, and poured scalding hot Sand upon it; at which Time the
Intendant's Lady obtained Leave of the Governor to have the

Coup-de-grace
given, and I believe she thereby likewise obtained a
Favour to every Reader, in delivering him from a further continuance of
this Account of
French
Cruelty.

Notwithstanding this Cruelty, which the
French
Governor manifested
towards the
Five Nations
, and thereby his Hatred of them, he found
Peace with them so necessary to
Canada
, that he still pursued it by
all the Means in his Power. For this Purpose the
Praying Indians
(who,
as I observed before, are
Mohawks
, and have always kept a
Correspondence with their own Nation) were employed to bring it about,
and to endeavour a Cessation of Arms, that the Governor might have an
Opportunity of shewing what kind Things he had in his Heart towards the

Five Nations
, but without Success.

CHAP. VIII.

The
Five Nations
treat with Captain
Ingoldsby.

T
he Governor of
New-York
, Colonel
Slaughter
's Death, soon after his
Arrival, was very prejudicial to the Affairs of
New-York
; for Captain

Ingoldsby
, who had no other Commission but that of Captain of one of
the Independent Companies of Foot, took upon himself the Government of
the Province, without any Authority; and he having likewise highly
offended a great Number of the People, by the Share he took in the late
Party Quarrels, it was not easy for him to prosecute any vigorous
Measures. He was reckoned to be much more a Soldier than a Statesman.

Captain
Ingoldsby
met the Five Nations at
Albany
, the sixth of

June
1692. In his Speech, he told them of his vigorous Resolutions to
prosecute the War, and then blamed them for not sending (according to
their Promise) a Party down
Cadarackui River
, to join them that went
from
Albany
against
Montreal
, and for their Carelesness in suffering
themselves to be surprised last Winter in their Hunting. He desired them
to keep the Enemy in perpetual Alarm, by the Incursions of their Parties
into the Enemy's Country, and to give him timely Notice of all their
Motions. He told them in the next Place, that he heard the
French
were
still using their wonted Artifice, of amusing them with Offers of Peace;
but the former Proceedings of the
French
sufficiently demonstrates,
said he to the Brethren, that while Peace is in their Mouths, War is in
their Hearts, and the late horrid Murder of the Brethren, after Quarter
given, sufficiently shews the Perfidy and Rancour of their Hearts. It is
in vain, said he, to think of any Cessation of Arms, much less of a
Peace, while the two Kings are at War at Home. He added,
Virginia
is
ready to assist us, and only waits the King's Orders, which are daily
expected, and then renewed the Chain for
Virginia
. In the last Place
he told them, that he heard the
Dionondadas
had sent two Prisoners
Home, with a View thereby to procure Peace; and advised them by all
Means to make Peace with that Nation.

The
Five Nations
answered by
Cheda
, an
Oneydo Sachem:

"
Brother
Corlear,

The
Sachems
of the
Five Nations
have with great Attention heard

Corlear
speak; we shall make a short Recital, to shew you with what
Care we have hearkened. After the Recital he continued.

We heartily thank
Corlear
, for his coming to this Place to view the
Strength thereof, for his bringing Forces with him, and for his
Resolution of putting Garisons into the Frontier Places.
Giving five
Bevers and a Belt.

Brother
Corlear
, as to what you blame us for, let us not reproach one
another, such Words do not favour well among Friends. They gave nothing
with this Article.

Brother
Corlear
, be patient under the Loss of your Men, as we are of
the
Mohawks
our Brethren, that were killed at the same Time. You take
no Notice of the great Losses we have suffered. We designed to have come
to this Place to have condoled with you in your Loss, but the War took
up all our Time, and employed all Hands. They
gave five Bevers, four
Otters, and one Belt
, as a Gift of Condolence.

Brother
Corlear
, we are all Subjects of one great King and Queen, we
have one Head, one Heart, one Interest, and are all ingaged in the same
War. You tell us, that we must expect no Peace while the Kings are at
War on the other Side the great Water. We thank you for being so plain
with us. We assure you we have no Thoughts of Peace. We are resolved to
carry on the War, though we know we only are in danger of being Losers.
Pray do you prosecute the War with the same Resolution. You are strong
and have many People. You have a great King, who is able to hold out
long. We are but a small People, and decline daily, by the Men we lose
in this War, we do our utmost to destroy the Enemy; but how strange does
it seem to us! How unaccountable! that while our great King is so
inveterate against the
French
, and you are so earnest with us to carry
on the War, that Powder is now sold dearer to us than ever? We are poor,
and not able to buy while we neglect hunting; and we cannot hunt and
carry on the War at the same Time: We expect, that this Evil we so
justly complain of be immediately remedied.
Giving nine Bevers.

Brother
Corlear
, you desire us to keep the Enemy in perpetual Alarm,
that they may have no Rest, till they are in their Graves; Is it not to
secure your own Frontiers? Why then not one Word of your People that are
to join us? We assure you we shall continue to carry on the War into the
Heart of the Enemies Country.
Giving eight Bevers.

We the
Five Nations
,
Mohawks
,
Oneydoes
,
Onondagas
,
Cayugas
,
and
Senekas
, renew the Silver Chain whereby we are linked fast with
our Brethren of
Assarigoa
(
Virginia
) and we promise to preserve it
as long as the Sun shall shine in the Heavens.
Giving ten Bevers.

But Brother
Corlear
, How comes it, that none of our Brethren fastened
in the same Chain with us, offer their helping Hand in this general War,
in which our great King is engaged against the
French
? Pray
Corlear
,
how come
Maryland
,
Delaware River
, and
New-England
, to be
disengaged from this War? You have always told us, that they are our
Brethren, Subjects of the same great King. Has our King sold them? Or do
they fail in their Obedience? Or do they draw their Arms out of our
Chain? Or has the great King commanded, that the few Subjects he has in
this Place, should make War against the
French
alone? Pray make plain
to us this Mystery? How can they and we be Brethren, and make different
Families? How can they and we be Subjects of the same great King, and
not be engaged in the same War? How can they and we have the same Heart,
the same Head, and the same Interest, as you tell us, and not have the
same Thoughts? How comes it, that the Enemy burns and destroys the Towns
in
New-England
, and they make no Resistance? How comes our great King
to make War, and not to destroy his Enemies? When, if he would only
command his Subjects on this Side the great Lake to joyn, the
Destruction of the Enemy would not make one Summer's Work.

You need not warn us of the Deceit and Treachery of the
French
, who
would probably insinuate Thoughts of Peace; but Brethren, you need not
fear us, we will never hearken to them: Tho' at the same Time, we must
own, that we have not been without Thoughts of your being inclined to
Peace, by Reason of the Brethren's Backwardness in pushing on the War.
The
French
spread Reports among us to this Purpose, and say, that they
had in a Manner concluded the Matter with you. We rejoice to be now
assured of this Falshood. We shall never desist fighting the
French
as
long as we shall live. And
gave a Belt of Wampum
.

We now renew the old Chain, and here plant the Tree of Prosperity and
Peace. May it grow and thrive, and spread its Roots even beyond

Canada
.
Giving a Belt.

We make the House clean, where all our Affairs of Importance are
transacted with these five Otters.

We return you Thanks for the Powder and Lead given us; but what shall we
do with them without Guns, shall we throw them at the Enemy? We doubt
they will not hurt them so. Before this we always had Guns given us. It
is no Wonder the Governor of
Canada
gains upon us, for he supplies his

Indians
with Guns as well as Powder; he supplies them plentifully with
every Thing that can hurt us.
Giving five Otters.

As to the
Dionondadas
setting two of our Nation at Liberty, we must
tell you, that it was not the Act of that Nation, but the private Act of
one Person: We are desirous to make Peace with that Nation as soon as we
can, upon honourable Terms. And
gave a Belt
.

The
Mohawks
, before they left the Place, desired a private Conference
with the Governor, and told him, that they were all exceedingly
dissatisfied, that the other
English
Colonies gave no Assistance, and
that it might prove of ill Consequence. Captain
Ingoldsby
promised to
write to them, and hoped it would have a good Effect.

CHAP. IX.

The
French
surprise and take three
Mohawk
Castles
.

T
he
Praying Indians
promised their Endeavours to reconcile their
Brethren the
Mohawks
to the
French
, on whom the
French
expected
they would have much Influence; but their Endeavours proving
ineffectual, their Correspondence began to be suspected. The
French

thought they did more Hurt than Good, by the Intelligence the Enemy by
their Means received. The
French
in
Canada
began to lose their
Spirits, by being obliged to remain so long upon the defensive, as the

Five Nations
gained more Courage by it. The Count
de Frontenac

thought it therefore absolutely necessary to undertake some bold
Enterprize, to shew the
Five Nations
, that they had to do with an
Enemy still able to act offensively: An Attack on the
Mohawks
he
thought would be most effectual for this Purpose, because it would shew,
at the same Time, that the
English
would not protect their nearest
Neighbours. As this was designed to be done by Surprize, the Winter
Season was chosen for this Purpose, as least to be suspected at such a
Time; and when the Enemy could not, without great Hardship, keep Scouts
abroad, to discover them or the
English
give any Assistance.

The Body of the
French
designed for this Expedition was put under
three Captains of the regular Troops, and thirty Subalterns, and
consisted of picked Men of the regular Troops of the common Militia of
the Country of the
Praying Indians
, the
Quatoghies
of
Loretto
,

Adirondacks
, and
Sohokies
, who live to the eastward of
Boston
,
making in all about six or seven hundred Men, so that a great Part of
the Force of
Canada
was employed in it. They were well supplied with
all Sorts of Ammunition, Provision, Snow-Shoes, and such Conveniencies
for Carriage, as were practicable upon the Snow, and through such great
Forests as they had to pass. The
French
at
Canada
have a Kind of
light Sledges made with Skins, and are drawn by large Dogs on the frozen
Snow.

They set out from
la Prairie de Magdeleine
the 15th of
January

1692-3, after having endured what might have been thought unsurmountable
Hardships; they passed by
Schenectady
at some Distance from it, on the
8th of
February
, at which Time one that had been taken Prisoner, when
that Place was sacked, made his Escape from them, and gave the People of

Schenectady
Intelligence of the
French
, who by an Express,
immediately informed the Commandant of
Albany
. The Millitia was
expeditiously raised, and a Lieutenant with fifty five Horse was
immediately dispatched to
Schenectady
; but no Care was taken to give
the
Mohawks
Notice, which might have been done without much Danger, by
sending up the South Side of the River, whilst the
French
marched on
the North. The
French
, on the 8th at Night, reached the first
Mohawk

Castle, where there were only five Men, and some Women and Children in
great Security, their other Men being all abroad, these were all taken
without Opposition. The next Fort not far from it was in like Manner
surprized, without any Opposition, both of them were very small, and
being next the
English
, not fortified.

Schenectady
being the nearest
English
Settlement to the
Mohawks
,
and but a little Way from their nearest Castle, many of them are always
there. The
Mohawks
then in the Town were exceedingly enraged, that
none went out to assist their Nation; some were sent therefore out the
next Day, to gain Information of the Enemy, and to give the
Mohawks

Notice; but they returned without doing their Duty.

The
French
went on to the next
Mohawk
Fort, which was the largest;
and coming to that in the Night, they heard some Noise, and suspected
they were discovered: But this Noise was only occasioned by a War Dance,
forty of the
Indians
designing to go next Day upon some Enterprize.
The
French
approached the Castle silently, and finding the
Indians

no way on their Guard, opened the Gate, and entered before they were
discovered; but notwithstanding this, and the Confusion the
Indians

must be in, this Conquest was not without Loss of Blood, the
French

having lost thirty Men, before the
Indians
entirely submitted: The

French
designed to have put them all to the Sword, but their own

Indians
would not suffer it, and gave Quarter: They took three hundred
Prisoners, of whom one hundred were fighting Men. I have no Account of
the Number of
Mohawks
killed, but no Doubt it was very considerable.

When the Account came to
Albany
, how much the
Mohawks
, who were at

Schenectady
, were enraged, that no Assistance was sent to their
Countrymen;
Peter Schuyler
a Major of the Militia offered himself to
go with what Force could be got ready for their Assistance. He went
himself immediately to
Schenectady
, and sent out to discover the
Enemy: His Scouts brought him Intelligence, first, that the
French

were in Possession of the two smallest Forts, afterwards, that they had
heard great Firing at the largest Fort; and at last, that it was taken.
Having received 200 Men, partly regular Troops, but most of the Militia,
he began his March on the 12th in Quest of the Enemy; but hearing soon
after, that six hundred Men of the upper Castles were on their March,
'tis probable he did not endeavour to be up with the
French
so soon as
he might; for I find by his Journal, that he was nearer them on the
fourteenth, than he was two Days after. He had not sufficient Force to
fight them: He sent therefore to the upper
Indians
, to hasten their
March. On the 15th he was joined by these
Indians
, in all two hundred
and ninety Men and Boys, very ill armed. His Body then consisted of two
hundred and fifty Christians, and two hundred and ninety
Indians
,
armed fighting Men. They had no other Provision but some Biscuit every
Man had in his Pocket. On the 16th he was informed by an
Indian
, who
pretended to be a Deserter, that the
French
had built a Fort, where
they designed to wait for him, and fight him; whereupon he sent an
Express to Coll.
Ingoldesby
, then Commandant at
Albany
, to hasten
more Men to join him, with sufficient Provision for the whole. He found
afterwards, that this
Indian
was sent by the French, on purpose to
persuade the
Indians
to give over the Pursuit. Major
Schuyler
came
up to the Enemy on the 17th; when he came near them he did not go on
streight towards them, for Fear of Ambuscades, but marched round. As
soon as he came in Sight, he was saluted with three loud Shouts, which
were answered with as much Noise. The
Indians
began in their Manner to
secure themselves, by felling the Trees between them, and the Enemy
sallied out to prevent them, but were soon beat back. The
Indians
fell
to Work again, and desired the Christians to assist them, which was
done, but in such Confusion, that they themselves were in Danger from
the falling Trees. The
French
sallied a second Time with all their
Force, crying out,
They run, we'll cut them off, and get their
Provisions
; but they were warmly received, and beat back into their
Fort. They sallied a third Time, and were beat back with considerable
Loss, the
Indians
bringing in several Heads and Scalps. As soon as the
Skirmishing was over, the Major sent back an Express, to hasten the Men
that were to reinforce him, and were to bring Provision, some of the Men
having had no Provision for two Days. The
Major
then secured himself,
under the Cover of the fallen Trees, and kept out Watches to observe the

French
.

The 18th proving a cold stormy Day, with Snow, he was informed, by a
Deserter, that the
French
were upon their March, it not being easy to
follow their Tracks, or to discover them in such Weather. The Officers
were commanded to pursue and retard their March, till the Reinforcement
should come up, but the Men refused to march without Provision. The
Officers, with about 60 Men, and a Body of
Indians
, followed the Enemy
till Night, when they began to secure themselves, by fortifying their
Camp. The Officers wanting a sufficient Number to secure themselves in
like Manner, or to sight the Enemy, returned, leaving about forty
Christians, and one hundred
Indians
, to observe them. On the 19th the
Provisions, with about 80 Men, arrived, under the Command of Captain

Sims
of the regular Troops. Every Man, as he was served with
Provision, marched towards the Enemy. The Van was commanded by Captain

Peter Matthews
of the regular Troops, who coming up with the Enemy's
Rear, would have attacked them, to retard their March, but the
Mohawks

were averse to fighting. The French dropt on purpose several of their
Prisoners, who told the
Mohawks
, that the
French
were resolved to
put all the Prisoners to the Sword, if they should be attacked. The
Enemy passed the North Branch of
Hudson
's River upon a Cake of Ice,
which, very opportunely for them, stuck there in one Place, while it was
open by a late Thaw, both above and below. The Weather continuing very
cold, and the
Indians
averse to fighting, Major
Schuyler
gave over
the Pursuit on the 20th, having lost only four private Men, and as many

Indians
, two Officers and twelve Men Christians and
Indians
were
wounded. The
French
lost thirty three Men (the Bodies of twenty seven
were found) of whom four were Officers, and twenty-six wounded, as the
Deserters told him. Between forty and fifty Prisoners were recovered. I
have been told, that Captain
Matthews
desired Coll.
Schuyler
, when
he came first up with the
French
, to summon them to surrender; he
said, the
French
are in great Distress, and this will give them an
Opinion of our Strength; but Coll.
Schuyler
refused, tho' he was
brave, he was no Soldier; and it is very probable, that the
French

observing the want of Conduct and Discipline, were encouraged. It is
true, the
English
were in great Want of Provisions at that Time. The

Indians
eat the Bodies of the
French
that they found. Coll.

Schuyler
(as he told me himself) going among the
Indians
at that
Time, was invited to eat Broth with them, which some of them had ready
boiled, which he did, till they, putting the Ladle into the Kettle to
take out more, brought out a
French
Man's Hand, which put an End to
his Appetite.

The
French
went home as fast as they could carry their wounded Men
with them; but coming to a Place, where they had hid Provisions for
their Supply in their return, they found it all spoiled. This put them
in great Distress, so that they were forced to eat their Shoes; they
sent some of the nimblest Men forward to
Montreal
, that Provision
might meet them. As soon as they came near the Settlements they
dispersed, every Man running home to eat, so that they returned to

Canada
like an Army routed. The
French
own they lost eighty Men, and
had thirty three wounded in this Expedition.

One may wonder how it is possible for Men to march several hundred Miles
in the Wilderness, while the Ground is every where covered with Snow,
two or three Feet deep at least; but the foremost march on Snow Shoes,
which beat a firm Track for those that follow. At Night, when they rest,
they dig a Hole in the Snow, throwing the Snow up all round, but highest
towards that Side from whence the Wind blows, so large, as to contain as
many Men as can lye round a Fire: They make the Fire in the Middle, and
cover the frozen Ground round it with the small Branches of the
Fir-Trees. Thus they tell me a Man lyes much warmer, than one imagines
that never tried it.

When the Information of the
French
came to
Schenectady
, an Express
was sent to
New-York
to Coll.
Fletcher
then Governor there; the
Express reached
New-York
, an hundred and fifty Miles from
Albany
,
the 12th at ten in the Night. The Governor got the City Regiment under
Arms by eight the next Morning.

He called out to know who were willing to go with him to the Frontiers,
they all immediately threw up their Hats, and answered one and all.
Indeed the People of this Province have, upon all Occasions, shewn
their Courage and Resolution in Defence of their Country; but the
Misfortune is, they are under no Discipline, and have been seldom led by
Men that knew their Duty. The Governor ordered an hundred and fifty
Voluntiers for this Service, and as many more from
Long-Island
. The
River then happened to be open by a sudden Thaw, which does not, at that
Time of the Year, happen once in twenty Years. He embarked three hundred
Men in five Sloops, by four in the Afternoon of the 14th, and arrived at

Albany
the 17th at nine in the Morning. The same Day the Governor went
to
Schenectady
, and ordered the Men to follow, but before they could
get every Thing ready for their March into the Woods, they had an
Account, that Major
Schuyler
was upon his Return. Several Gentlemen of

Albany
, particularly Mr.
Lanslear
, a Gentleman of the best Estate
there, went out Voluntiers under Major
Schuyler
, which I ought not to
have forgot.

Coll.
Fletcher
made a Speech to the
Mohawks
at
Albany
, he blamed
their supine Negligence, in suffering themselves to be surprised in the
Manner they were in Time of War. He told them that they had Reason to be
convinced, that the
English
were their Friends heartily, by the Number
of Men he had marched to their Assistance in a very little Time, upon
the first Notice. He promised to wipe away their Tears in the Spring, by
considerable Presents; and that he would, in the mean while, take Care
of their Subsistence, by providing Houses and Victuals for them. He told
them, he doubted they had some false Brethren among them, that gave the

French
Information, and favoured their Designs; and in the last Place,
advised them to convince the
French
, that they had not lost their
Courage with this Misfortune.

The
Mohawks
, in their Answer, called Coll.
Fletcher
by the Name of

Cayenguirago
; and he was called so by the
Indians
always after
this. It signifies
a great swift Arrow
, as an Acknowledgement of the
Speed he made to their Assistance. But they appeared, in their Answer,
to be quite disheartned; they had not, in the Memory of any Man,
received such a Blow. They said their Strength was quite broke, by the
Continuance of the War; but they added, if all the
English
Colonies
would join, they could still easily take
Canada
: Their being so ill
armed, was the Reason (they said) that the
French
had now escaped.

The
French
, continued they, arm their
Indians
compleatly, and
furnish them with every Thing necessary for War, as we find every Time
we meet with them.

The
French
had got a great Quantity of Furs, and other Peltry, at

Missilimakinak
, by their Trade with the
Indians
; but the
Five
Nations
had so effectually blocked up the Passage between that and

Canada
, that they had remained there useless to the
French
for
several Years. The Count
de Frontenac
, after his Success against the

Mohawks
, was in Hopes the
Five Nations
would keep more at home in
Defence of their own Castles, and with these Hopes sent a Lieutenant,
with eighteen
Canadians
, and twenty
praying Indians
, to open the
Passage to
Missilimakinak
; but this Party fell in with another of the

Five Nations
, who entirely routed them, so that a few escaped only, to
give an Account of their Misfortune; at last 200 Canoes, loaded with
Furs from
Missilimakinak
, arrived at
Montreal
, which gave as
universal a Joy to
Canada
, as the Arrival of the
Galleons
give in

Spain
.

CHAP. X.

The Treaties and Negotiations the
Five Nations
had with the
English

and
French,
in the Years
1693
and
1694.

A
s by this Time the Reader may be tired with the horrid Scenes of a
barbarous War, it may be some Relief to observe the
Indian
Genius in
the Arts of negotiating; and see how a barbarous People, without any of
the Arts and Sciences in which we value our selves, manage their
Interest with the most learned, most polite, and artificial Nation in

Europe
. The
Five Nations
were informed, that the Governor of

Canada
had received from
Europe
a very considerable Recruit of
Soldiers, and of all Sorts of Ammunition. This, with the great Loss the

Mohawks
had lately suffered, while they had been amused by the

English
with great Hopes, and very little real Assistance, made the

Oneydoes
, at last yield to the Solicitations of the Jesuit
Milet
, to
send a Message to the
French
for Peace. It is probable he had the Art
to influence the People at
Albany
to favour his Designs, by giving
them Hopes of being included in the Peace, as may be conjectured, from
what will appear in the Sequel.

Coll.
Fletcher
being informed, that the
Oneydoes
had sent a
Messenger to
Canada
, sent for the
Five Nations
to
Albany
. He spoke
to them the third of
July
1693.

He first excused his not meeting them as he had promised, at the Time
the Sap begins to run in the Trees, by Reason of his having received a
Commission to be Governor of
Pensilvania
, to which Place he was
obliged at that Time to go. He put them in Mind with what Speed he came
to their Assistance last Winter, and how effectual, in all Probability,
it would have been, had they only retarded the Enemy's March till he
could have reached them: He advised them to guard against being drunk,
and shewed them the ill Consequences of it in Time of War.

Then he said, "I have received Information, that some of the Brethren
are wavering, and inclined to Peace with the Enemy; and am assured,
that such Thoughts must arise from the Instigation of the Jesuit

Milet
, whom some of the Brethren have suffered to live so long among
them, and whose only Practice is to delude and betray them. Let me
therefore advise you to remove that ill Person from among you."

In the End he condoled their Dead, and made them a very considerable
Present of ninety Guns, eight hundred and ten Pound of Powder, eight
hundred Bars of Lead, a Thousand Flints, eighty seven Hatchets, four
Gross of Knives, besides a considerable Quantity of Cloathing and
Provisions. This Present, he told them, their King and Queen had sent
them, and renewed the Covenant for all the
English
Colonies.

The King usually sends them a considerable Present with every new
Governor sent to
New-York
, which is not always applied as it is
designed. If this Present had been made sooner, it had been of much more
Use to the
English
, as well as to the
Five Nations
.

The
Five Nations
the next Day spoke as follows.

Brother
Cayenguirago
,

"We are involved in a bloody War, which makes us sit in Sorrow
and Grief; and being about to speak of Matters of Importance,
we, in the first Place, clear the Mouth and Throat of our
Interpretess, by
giving her these three Bever Skins
."

Then they repeated his Excellency's Speech, in Answer to which they
said,

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, we rejoice, that the great King and
Queen of
England
take such Notice of us, as we find, by the
large Present sent us; we return hearty Thanks for the
Ammunition especially.

"We are glad that our Brother
Cayenguirago
renews the Chain,
not only between us and this Government, but likewise with

New-England
,
Virginia
,
Maryland
and
Pensilvania
; it
shall be kept inviolable by us the
Five Nations
, as long as
the Sun shines. We pray our Brother
Cayenguirago
to have a
watchful Eye, that none of the other Colonies keep any
Correspondence with the Enemy, but use their Endeavours to
destroy them. We heard nothing of what you told us of the Priest

Milet
, who lives at
Oneydo
, till we came to this Town. We
have enquired the Truth of our Brethren the
Oneydoes
, who
confess, that the Priest sent an
Indian
to
Canada
with
Letters, which has surprised us very much.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, you are our great Tree, whose Roots
extend to the utmost Bounds of this Government; we desire you
may not be disturbed when any of our Prisoners misbehave, for
they are not countenanced by us; and all proper Methods shall be
taken, to prevent the like for the future. In like Manner we beg
you to take Care, that none of the Prisoners you have correspond
with the Enemy, as we suspect the Chevalier
D'O
. did; and that
he was sent with Letters to
Canada
by some of our Brethren.
(He made his Escape from
Boston
.)

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, In former Times our Propositions to one
another were only Discourses of Peace and Friendship, and in
giving Presents; but how much is the Case altered of late? Now
we talk of nothing but War, and are continually prompting one
another to it. As to our Parts, we will keep close to the War to
the last Drop of our Blood; and tho' we be tossed to and fro
with Storms, we will remain stedfast to the last Man, as it was
resolved by both in the Beginning of the War.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, we were told in our own Country, not
only that the King had made you Governor of
Pensilvania
, but
likewise that you were preparing a Fleet to take
Canada
. O!
what joyful News this was to our young Men.
Sadagarus
, the
great
Seneka
Captain, was to command them. Now they said, we
need only make one hearty Push, while the Fleet is before

Quebeck
. Now there will be an End to this bloody War, and all
our Troubles; But alas, now we are come here, we hear not one
Word of this Design.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, you are that flourishing Tree that
covers us; you keep the Chain bright; we have one Request to
make to you, that you may stay with us, and not return to

England
; for you know our Ways and Manners. If you have any
Thing to tell the King and Queen, write it to them, for the King
knows you to be a wise Man, and will therefore believe you.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, we are very glad to hear that

Pensilvania
is come under your Government, bring their young
Men here, with their Bows and Arrows and Hatchets in their
Hands, for this is the Place of Action. We are pleased that the

Showonons
or
Satanas
, who are our Enemies, have applied to
you for Protection; and that you sent them to us to endeavour a
Peace, and that you sent Christians with them, to conduct them
back again. We wish they were come to assist us against the
common Enemy.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, now we have done, but must tell you
again, that we roll and wallow in Joy, by Reason of the great
Favour the great King and Queen has done us, in sending us Arms
and Ammunition, at a Time when we are in the greatest Need of
them; and because there is such Unity among the Brethren."

They made the Governor a considerable Present of Furs, to shew their
Respect to his Person; but they did not give one Belt to confirm any one
Article; so that the whole of it is, according to their Stile, only
argumentative.

Coll.
Fletcher
not being satisfied with their Answer, concerning the
Jesuit
Milet
, made this further Proposal to them. "As to
Milet
the
Priest, whom the Brethren of
Oneydo
still harbour among them, I must
tell you again, that he betrays you, and all your Councils; and that you
may see I desire not to diminish your Number, I am willing to give you a
pretty
Indian
Boy, in Lieu of the old Priest; and accordingly the Boy
was brought and delivered to them."

In answer to this the
Oneydo Sachem
said, "As soon as the
Indian

Messenger returns all his Papers shall be taken from him, and be
forthwith brought to our Brother
Cayenguirago
, before the Priest shall
see any of them: we are willing to take the Boy in Exchange for the
Priest, but it is not safe to do it, while our Messenger is in the Power
of the Enemy; let the Boy stay here till we bring the Priest, which
shall be as soon as the Messenger shall return". But he gave no Belt, or
other Present, to confirm this Promise. He added,

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, we now acquaint you that it is proposed by all
the
Five Nations
, to make Peace with the
Dionondadies
, a Nation of

Indians
near in Alliance with the
French
of
Canada
. This will both
strengthen us and weaken the Enemy. The
Senekas
, who live nearest
them, have undertaken this Treaty, and take Belts of Wampum from the
other Nations, to confirm the Peace. We desire your Approbation, that
you would send your Belt in Concurrence, as our eldest Brother in our
Chain."

The Governor approved of this, and
gave them a Belt
to carry in his
Name.

Notwithstanding what the Speaker of the
Five Nations
had promised to
the Governor, to bring all the Papers the
Oneydo
Messenger should
bring from
Canada
, before the Jesuit
Milet
should have Liberty to
see them, it could not be difficult for the Jesuit, to persuade them to
keep the Power of making Peace in their own Hands, and for that Purpose,
to call a Meeting of the
Sachems
of
Onondago
, where all such Matters
had been formerly transacted among themselves, and there to determine
independently, rather than to submit themselves to another Nation at

Albany
. They only invited the
English
to assist at the general
Council. The
English
used what Arguments they could to dissuade this
Meeting, but rather to observe the Promise made to the Governor; and it
seems used some Threatning. The
Mohawks
had so much Regard to the

English
, that they refused to assist at the Council. The other four,
notwithstanding this, met, and resolved on an Answer to be sent to the
Governor of
Canada
; but at the same Time, to shew their Regard to the

Mohawks
and
English
, these Resolutions were not to be final, till
they should first be communicated to the
English
and
Mohawks
, and
their Advice received thereon; for which Purpose several
Sachems
were
sent to
Albany
, of whom
Decanesora
was the Principal and the
Speaker.

Decanesora
had for many Years the greatest Reputation among the
Five
Nations
for speaking, and was generally employed as their Speaker, in
their Negotiations with both
French
and
English
: He was grown old
when I saw him, and heard him speak; he had a great Fluency in speaking,
and a graceful Elocution, that would have pleased in any Part of the
World. His Person was tall and well made, and his Features, to my
thinking, resembled much the Bustos of
Cicero
. I shall give an Account
of these Negotiations from
Decanesora
's Mouth, because his Narration
agrees in the main with the Account the
French
give of them, and
carries along with it as strong Evidences of Truth, as that of the

French
do: but the chief Reason is, that I intend to give the Reader
as perfect a Notion as I can of the
Indian
Genius; and here it will
appear, what Art
Decanesora
had, to make an Account of an Affair less
disagreeable to
English
Ears, which had been undertaken against their
Advice, and contrary to their Interest.

Decanesora
spoke to Major
Schuyler
(
Quider
) and the Magistrates of

Albany
, the second of
February
1693-4 as follows.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
[38]
, we are come to acquaint you, that
our Children the
Oneydoes
having of themselves sent a
Messenger to
Canada
, he has brought back with him a Belt of
Peace from the Governor of
Canada
.

"As soon as
Tariha
(the Messenger) arrived at
Canada
, he was
asked, where the six hundred Men were that were to attack

Canada
, as they had been informed by
Cariokese
a
Mohawk

Deserter? He assured them there was no such Design.

"He was carried to
Quebeck
, where he delivered his Belt, with
the following Propositions.
Onondio
, if you would have Peace
go to
Albany
, and ask it there, for the
Five Nations
will do
nothing without
Cayenguirago
. The Governor of
Canada
was
angry at this, and said, he had nothing to do with the Governor
of
New-York
, he would treat only with the
Five Nations
; the
Peace between the Christians must be made on the other Side the
great Lake. He added, he was sorry to see the
Five Nations
so
far degenerated, as to take a sixth Nation into their Chain, to
rule over them. If you had desired me to come and treat in any
of your Castles, I would have done it; but to tell me I must go
to
Albany
, is to desire of me what I can by no Means do. You
have done very ill, to suffer the People of
New-York
to
govern you so far, that you dare do nothing without their
Consent. I advise you to send two of each Nation to me, and let

Decanesora
be one of them. I have Orders from the King my
Master to grant you Peace, if you come in your proper Persons to
ask it. The Governor of
Canada
afterwards said,

"Children of the
Five Nations
, I have Compassion for your
little Children, therefore come speedily, and speak of Peace to
me, otherwise I'll stop my Ears for the future: By all Means let

Decanesora
come; for if the
Mohawks
come alone, I will not
hear them, some of all the
Five Nations
must come. Now

Tariha
return home, and tell the
Five Nations
, that I will
wait for their coming till the Trees bud, and the Bark can be
parted from the Trees. I design for
France
in the Spring, and
I leave a Gentleman to command here, to whom I have given Orders
to raise Soldiers, if you do not come in that Time, and then
what will become of you? I am truly grieved to see the
Five
Nations
so debauched and deceived by
Cayenguirago
, who is
lately come to
New-York
, and by
Quider
. Formerly the chief
Men of the
Five Nations
used to converse with me; but this
Governor of
New-York
has so deluded you, that you hearken to
none but him; but take Care of what will follow, if you hearken
to none but him."

Then
Decanesora
excused the not sending the Letters to
Albany
, which
came by
Tariha
, as they had promised, saying, the other Nations
trusted this to the
Oneydoes
, because the Messenger was to return to
them, and the
Oneydoes
deceived the others. He likewise excused their
not coming to
Albany
as soon as
Tariha
returned, which was in

November
. He said the chief
Sachem
of the
Onondagas
, who was
entrusted (as their Speaker) by the
Five Nations
with their general
Affairs, by the general Council of
Onondaga
, had a sore Leg, and could
not travel
[39]
.

That in such Case he (
Decanesora
) did all that was in his Power, that
is, he called a Council at
Onondaga
, to give Directions in this
Affair; and that he invited
Quider
to this Council. He continued,

"The four Nations that met there resolved to send Deputies to

Canada
, and that I
Decanesora
was to be one of them; but at
the same Time ordered me, with some others, to communicate the
Resolutions of the General Council to our Brethren at
Albany
,
and to the
Mohawks
, to be farther advised by them.

"The Resolutions are, to
send three Belts
to the Governor of

Canada
, with the following Propositions.

"I.
Onondio
, you have sent for me often, and as often asked,
why I am afraid to come? The great Kettle of War that you have
hung over the Fire is the Reason of it. Then laying down the
first Belt, I am to ask his Consent to the other two Belts which
I still keep in my Hand.

"II. We now not only throw down the Kettle, and thereby throw
the boiling Water out of it, but likewise break it to Pieces,
that it may never be hanged up again by this second Belt.

"III. Hearken,
Onondio
, you are sent from the
French
King,
your Master, as
Cayenguirago
is from the great King and Queen
of
England
. What I am now about to speak to you, is by
Inspiration from the great God of Heaven. You say that you will
have nothing to do with our Brethren of
Cayenguirago
, but I
must tell you, that we are inseparable, we can have no Peace
with you so long as you are at War with them; we must stand and
fall with them; which I am to confirm, by laying down the third
Belt.

"When this was concluded the Jesuit
Milet
, and another

French
Gentleman (who had been taken Prisoner, and was taken
into the Place of the chief
Sachem of Onondaga
, formerly lost
in the War, and thereby became a
Sachem
) desired Leave to add
two Belts to the other three. By their being
Sachems
they had
a Vote in the General Council, and a Right to propose any Thing.
They wrote and read to us the Purports of their Belts, and we
have brought their Papers with us, to shew to our Brethren."

To shew the Necessity they were under of making Peace, speedily he
added:

"That two Women, who were Prisoners at
Canada
, had made their Escape,
on Purpose to inform them that the
French
were making great
Preparations of Battoes, and other Necessaries for an Expedition; one
said, she had informed one of the
Sachems
of the
Praying Indians
of
her Design, who sent an
Indian
with her to advise the
Five Nations
,
to prevent the great Danger they were threatened with by a speedy
Conclusion of the Peace; and added, that they had sent one of their
People back with this
Praying Indian
, to assure them that Deputies
would certainly go to
Canada
in the Spring to treat of Peace." I make
no Doubt, this was only an Article to hasten the
Five Nations
to
conclude the Peace, lest the
English
, if it were delayed, should find
Means to prevent it. Then he shewed the Flag which the Governor of

Canada
sent them to be carried by their Deputies, that the
French

might know them. Upon these Resolutions being taken, the
Five Nations

recalled six hundred Men, that they had placed along
Cadarackui River
,
to intercept the
French
, as they passed to and from
Missilimakinak
.

The Jesuit's Papers being read to them, several Things were found in
them which he had not read to the General Council. To this
Decanesora

answered; "We know that the Priest favours his own Nation, and deceives
us in many Things; but it is not in his Power to alter our Affection to
our Brethren, we wish you would bury all Misunderstandings that you have
conceived on his Account; and we likewise wish you gave less Credit to
the Rum-Carriers than you do."

Here we see, by this Appellation, what a contemptible Character the
Traders have among the
Indians
, and yet the Government of
New-York

has almost perpetually trusted the Management of the
Indian
Affairs to
these Traders.

Decanesora
ended his Conference as follows:

"The Governor of
Canada
's Words, and the Resolutions of the
four Nations are now before you, consult therefore what is to be
done, and if it be necessary for the Brethren to go to our
Castles to advise us farther, be not unwilling; and then he laid
down a large Belt eleven Rows deep, and seven Fathom of Wampum."

The next Day Major
Schuyler
told them that he could consent to no
Treaty with the
French
; but proposed to them to meet the Governor here
in seventy Days, and that
Decanesora
in particular should return at
that Time, and gave a Belt.

They agreed to meet the Governor at that Time;

"But as for myself (says
Decanesora
) I cannot promise; I am
now the Minister of the General Council, and cannot dispose of
myself, but by their Directions; if they order me, I shall
willingly return. We did not expect to hear such positive
Prohibition of keeping any Correspondence with the
French
;
seventy Days must pass before we meet again, if any Mischief be
done by the Enemy in that Time, let us not blame one another.
Consider again what is most for the publick Good, and let it be
spoken before we part, and laid down a large Belt of fourteen
deep."

Major
Schuyler
then asked them again, whether they promised to stop
all Correspondence with the
French
, either by the Jesuit or otherwise,
for seventy Days, and till they shall have his Excellency the Governor's
Answer.

Decanesora
answered to this, "I have no Authority to answer this
Question. I shall lay the Belt down in every one of the Castles, and
tell, that by it all Correspondence is desired to stop with the

French
; but I cannot promise that this will be complied with."

Major
Schuyler
on the sixth called the
Indians
again together: He
advised them not to submit to, nor trust such a perfidious Nation as the

French
are, who have upon all Occasions proved themselves such. Be not
discouraged, (says he,
giving a Belt
) Heaven begins again to favour us.
This Day the Forerunners of the
Shawonons
are come to Town, seven
Nations are on their March following them, one Thousand in Number,
including Men, Women and Children, as you may learn from their own
Mouths. Take Courage, and be not afraid,
giving five Fathom of Wampum
.
This seemed a lucky Incident, and accordingly it had more Influence than
all other Arguments together.

Decanesora
, the next Day, called the Magistrates together, and told
them, you have at last shut up the Way to
Canada
, but we have one
Thing to ask, after mature Deliberation, which we expect will not be
refused us. Major
Schuyler
assured them that every Thing should be
granted, which was either for their Safety or Honour. We desire then,
said he, that you send a Messenger along with ours to the
Praying
Indians
at
Canada
, to tell them that the Priest is false; that we
are to meet
Cayenguirago
in the Spring, and therefore cannot go to

Canada
at that Time; and that a further Cessation of Arms be agreed
to, till such Time as we can go. We desire at least, that if you will
not send a Messenger, that you put the Message in Writing, as a Token of
your Assent to it. This last was agreed to, and the Message was put in
Writing in the following Words, and translated into
French
.

The
Dispatch of three Belts
, which two Messengers of the
Five Nations

carry to the
Caraguists
and Catholick
Indians
, according to what was
resolved by the
Agayandres
or
Sachems
of the
Five Nations
, at

Albany
,
February
the ninth 1694.

First Belt
.

The
Agayandres
of the
Five Nations
cannot go to
Canada
in the
Spring, as they gave Reason to expect by the last Message from

Onondaga
, because
Cayenguirago
has called all the
Five Nations
,
and other
Indians
, to meet him at
Albany
, in the Month of
April

next, to which the
Five Nations
have agreed.

Second Belt
.

If the
Caraguists
, or
French
, have any Thing to propose to the
Five
Nations
, they may safely come into our Country. This Belt opens the
Path, and secures it to them both coming and going.

Third Belt
.

The
Five Nations
, and their Friends, lay down the Hatchet till they
shall have an Answer, which they expect in forty Days. Provided
nevertheless, that the
Caraguists
and
French
tye their Hatchets down
at the same Time.

These Belts were accordingly presented to the
Praying Indians
of

Cahnuaga
, who refused to receive them but in the Presence of Mr.
de
Callieres
, Governor of
Montreal
. Mr.
de Callieres
acquainted the
Count
de Frontenac
with the Contents. After which the
Praying
Indians
, in Presence of Mr.
de Callieres
, gave the following Answer.

"We will have no Correspondence with the
Five Nations
, but by
Order of the Governor of
Canada
our Father, and unless

Decanesora
, and the other Deputies, come before the Feast of
St.
John
, the Way will be shut up for ever after, and our
Father's Ears will be stopt. We however assure you, that if the
Deputies come in that Time the Path shall be safe both coming
and going."

Whether the Accounts given of the coming of the
Shawonons
was only an
Amusement, or whether they were diverted on their March, I know not, for
I find no farther Account of them in the Register of the
Indian

Affairs: However it was, the Impression made on the
Indians
by that
News, was not sufficient to withstand the Force of the resolute Answer
their Messenger received from the
Praying Indians
.
Decanesora
and
the other Deputies went early in the Spring to
Canada
; the other

Sachems
met Colonel
Fletcher
at
Albany
, the fourth of
May
1694.
The
Indians
spoke first by
Sadakanahtie
, an
Onondaga Sachem
, as
follows:

"
Brother
Cayenguirago,

"Some of our
Sachems
agreed last Winter that we should keep no
Correspondence with the
French
; we confess that we have broke
that Promise, and that we have received a Messenger from

Canada
, and have sent our Deputies likewise thither. The Belt
is not yet arrived, by which we are to acknowledge our Fault in
doing this. The Reason of our doing it is truly this, we are
afraid of the Enemy.

"When a Messenger came last Year from
Canada
to
Onondaga
,
our Brother
Cayenguirago
discharged our Meeting in General
Council at
Onondaga
, to consult on that Message, and ordered
us to hold our General Council here at
Albany
on that Affair.
The Privilege of meeting in General Council, when we please, is
a Privilege we always have enjoyed; no former Governor, of the
Name of
Corlear
, ever obstructed this Privilege. We planted a
Tree of Peace in this Place with them, its Roots and Branches
extend as far as
Virginia
and
New-England
, and we have
reposed with Pleasure under its Shade. Brother, let us keep to
that first Tree, and let us be united and unanimous; such
Prohibition of our Assemblies will be of ill Consequence, and
occasion Differences between us.

"We acknowledge, I say, our sending Agents to
Canada
for
Peace, we were incouraged in doing this, by the Knowledge we
have of the Governor of
Canada
. He is an old Man, and was
formerly Governor of that Place. He was always esteemed a wise
peaceable Man, and therefore we trust our Message will have a
good Issue. We did not take it amiss that you sent to the

Dewagunhas
, nor that
Arnout
was sent to the
Satanas
, both
of them our Enemies; and, for the same Reason, our Brother

Cayenguirago
ought not to be displeased with our sending to
the
French
for Peace.

"We,
Onondagas
, acknowledge ourselves to have been the chief
Promoters of this Message, we have sent in all nine
Sachems

with nine Belts. It is true we are now under much Uneasiness in
having trusted so many
Sachems
in the
French
Hands, being
almost half the Number we have in our Nation, but we were in
haste to prevent the Designs the
French
had against our
Countries and yours, by the great warlike Preparations they were
making in
Canada
."

Then he told all the Orders and Directions which their Ambassadors had
received; which agreeing with the Account which
Decanesora
gave of his
Negotiation, I shall here pass over. He finished all by
giving a Belt
.

Colonel
Fletcher
told them, he would give no Answer to what they had
said, before they discovered to him what Reason they had to say, that he
had forbid their holding any Assembly at
Onondaga
, and that he had
made Peace with the
Dewagunhas
and
Satanas
, without their Consent
and Concurrence.

To this the Speaker the next Day answered; "I was sick, and absent when
the Affairs you mention were transacted, and I was at a Loss how to
excuse our sending to the
French
contrary to your Advice; but several

Sachems
being arrived since I spoke, I have been better informed by
them, who were present at those Transactions. We find it, in every
Circumstance, as our Brother
Cayenguirago
says; that you did not
obstruct our keeping General Councils at
Onondaga
, but only cautioned
us in hearkening to the Fallacies of the
French
, and in holding
Meetings on that Occasion. We assure you we will never separate from
you, we still have one Head, one Blood, one Soul, and one Heart with
you; and as a Confirmation of this I
give this Belt seven deep
.

"As to the
Dewagunhas
and
Shawonons
, we are confident
Cayenguirago

will not admit them into his Government, till they have made Peace with
us, which we shall willingly grant. When our Enemies are humbled, and
beg Peace, why should they not have it? Let them come and live with us,
it will strengthen our Country.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, when the Christians first arrived in this
Country, we received them kindly. When they were but a small People, we
entered into a League with them, to guard them from all Enemies
whatsoever. We were so fond of their Society, that we tied the great
Canoe which brought them, not with a Rope made of Bark to a Tree, but
with a strong iron Chain fastened to a great Mountain. Now before the
Christians arrived, the General Council of the
Five Nations
was held
at
Onondaga
, where there has, from the Beginning, a continual Fire
been kept burning; it is made of two great Logs, whose Fire never
extinguishes. As soon as the Hatchet-makers (their general Name for
Christians) arrived, this General Council at
Onondaga
planted this
Tree at
Albany
, whose Roots and Branches have since spread as far as

New-England
,
Connecticut, Pensilvania, Maryland
and
Virginia
; and
under the Shade of this Tree all these
English
Colonies have
frequently been sheltered. Then (
giving seven Fathom of Wampum
) he
renewed the Chain, and promised, as they likewise expected, mutual
Assistance, in Case of any Attack from any Enemy.

"The only Reason, to be plain with you, continued he, of our sending to
make Peace with the
French
, is the low Condition to which we are
reduced, while none of our Neighbours send us the least Assistance, so
that the whole Burthen of the War lyes on us alone. Our Brethren of

New-England, Connecticut
,
Pensilvania, Maryland
and
Virginia
, of
their own accord thrust their Arms into our Chain; but since the War
began we have received no Assistance from them. We alone cannot continue
the War against the
French
, by Reason of the Recruits they daily
receive from the other Side the great Lake.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, speak from your Heart, are you resolved to
prosecute the War vigorously against the
French
, and are your
Neighbours of
Virginia, Maryland, Pensilvania, Connecticut
and

New-England
, resolved to assist us? If it be so, we assure you,
notwithstanding any Treaty hitherto entered into, we will prosecute the
War as hotly as ever. But if our Neighbours will not assist, we must
make Peace, and we submit it to your Consideration, by
giving this great
Belt fifteen deep
.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, I have truly told you the Reasons which have
induced us to offer Peace to the
French
; we shall likewise, from the
Bottom of our Hearts, inform you of the Design we have in this Treaty.
When the Governor of
Canada
shall have accepted the nine Belts, of
which I have just now told you, then we shall have something more to say
by two large Belts, which lye still hid in our Bosom. We shall lay down
first one and say, We have a Brother
Cayenguirago
, with whose People
we have been united in one Chain from the Beginning, they must be
included in this Treaty; we cannot see them involved in bloody War,
while we sit in easy Peace. If the Governor of
Canada
answer, that he
has made a separate Peace with us, and that he cannot make any Peace
with
Cayenguirago
, because the War is from over the great Lake; then
we shall lay down the second great broad Belt, and tell the Governor of

Canada
, if you will not include
Cayenguirago
's People, the Treaty
will become thereby void, as if it had never been made; and if he
persists, we will absolutely leave him."

While the
Sachems
were at
Albany
,
Decanesora
and the other
Ambassadors arrived at the Castle of the
Praying Indians
, near the
Falls above
Montreal
. They were conducted from thence, by the Superior
of the Jesuits, to
Quebeck
. They had their Audience of the Governor of

Canada
with great Solemnity, in the Presence of all the Ecclesiasticks
and Officers of Distinction, and of the most considerable
Indians
then
in the Place. They were every Day, while they staid in the Place,
entertained at the Governor's Table, or at the Tables of the most
considerable Officers.
Decanesora
on his Side made a good Appearance,
being cloathed in Scarlet trim'd with Gold, and with a laced Bever Hat
on his Head, which had been given him by Colonel
Fletcher
before he
went.

The Jesuit
Milet
had by Letter informed the Governor of every Thing in
their Commission, and though he was thereby enabled to have answered
them immediately, he consulted three Days, after the Ambassadors had
delivered what they had to say, before he would return an Answer, that
it might appear with more Solemnity. The
Indians
never return a sudden
Answer on any Occasion of Importance, however resolved they be
beforehand, and despise those that do, though their Answer be never so
much to the Purpose. I choose to give an Account of this from

Decanesora
's Mouth, as I did of the former, and for the same Reason.
The Account given of it by the
Indians
agrees, in all the material
Points, with that published by the
French
, and I am confident it is
not less genuine.

Colonel
Fletcher
being sensible of what Consequence this Treaty
between the
French
and
Five Nations
might be of to all the
English

Colonies, gave them Notice of it, and informed them of the Reasons which
had induced the
Indians
to enter into it. He told them, there was no
Possibility of preventing it, but by the
Indians
being assured of more
effectual Assistance, than they had hitherto received, and advised them
to send Commissioners for that Purpose to
Albany
in
August
, at which
Time he intended to meet the
Five Nations
there, after the Return of
their Messengers from
Canada
. Accordingly,
Andrew Hamilton
, Esq;
Governor of
New-Jersey
, Colonel
John Pinchon
,
Samuel Sands
, Esq;
and Major
Pen Townsend
, Commissioners from
Massachuset's Bay
, and
Colonel
John Hauley
and Captain
Stanley
, Commissioners from

Connecticut
, waited on Colonel
Fletcher
at
Albany
, who carried
with him likewise a Part of the Council of
New-York
.

These Gentlemen having met the
Indians
at
Albany
the fifteenth of

August
,
Decanesora
rose up first, and desired Leave to sing a Song
or two of Peace, before they began on Business. Then
Rode
, a
Mohawk
Sachem
, rose up, and addressing himself to the other
Sachems
, said,
we have great Reason to rejoice, seeing so many of those, who are in our
Chain, are now met, to consult together on the general Weal; after which
they sang two or three Songs.

Sadakanahtie
being chosen Speaker for that Day, rose up, spoke much to
the same Purpose as he had done to Colonel
Fletcher
in
May
last;
giving a metaphorical Account of their League with the
English
, how it
began, and by what Steps it had been inlarged and strengthened; how the
other Colonies had thrust their Arms into this Chain, but had given
little or no Assistance against the common Enemy. "Our Brother

Cayenguirago
's Arms (says he) and ours are stiff, and tired with
holding fast the Chain, whilst our Neighbours sit still and smoak at
their Ease. The Fat is melted from our Flesh, and fallen on our
Neighbours, who grow fat while we grow lean: They flourish while we
decay.

"This Chain made us the Envy of the
French
, and if all had held it as
fast as
Cayenguirago
, it would have been a Terror also. If we would
all heartily join and take the Hatchet in our Hand, our common Enemy
would soon be destroyed, and we should for ever after live in Peace and
Ease. Do you but your Parts, and Thunder itself cannot break our Chain."

Then he mentioned some Jealousies they had entertained of
New-England
,
by their suffering the Chevalier
D'O
to escape to
Canada
, which they
suspected had been concerted between him and the People of

New-England
, in Order to treat of Peace. "Our Agents, said he, saw the
Chevalier
D'O
at
Canada
, who told them that he had been set at
Liberty by the
English
, and that it was in vain that the
Five
Nations
warred against the
French
, while the
English
favoured
them." On this Occasion he shewed them a Fish painted on Paper, which
the Commissioners of
New-England
had given them, when they first
entered into the Chain, as a Seal to the League.

He finished by telling them, that they would next Day give all the
Particulars of their Negotiation in
Canada
.

The next Day
Decanesora
proceeded to the Account of his Negotiation,
as follows: "The Governor of
Canada
having often sent to us to come to

Canada
to treat with him, we went thither, and told him that we were
come to treat of Peace. We made the following Proposals.

"Father, if we do not conclude a Peace now, it will be your Fault; for
we have already taken the Hatchet out of the Hands of the
River
Indians
(
Hudson
's River) whom we incited to the War. But we must tell
you, that you are an ill Man, you are inconstant and not to be trusted;
we have had War together a long Time, and though you occasioned the War,
we never hated the House of
Oghessa
, (a Gentleman living at

Montreal
) let him undertake the toilsome Journey to
Onondaga
; for if
he will he shall be welcome.

"Father, we are now speaking of Peace, and therefore I must speak a Word
to the
Praying Indians
, and first to those of
Cahnuaga
(chiefly

Mohawks
) you know our Customs and Manners, therefore make
Onondio

acquainted therewith, and be assisting in the prosecuting of this good
Work. Then to the other Castle, called
Canassadaga
, (chiefly

Onondagas
) you are worse than the
French
themselves, you deserted
from us, and side with our Enemies to destroy us; make some amends now,
by forwarding Peace.

"You have almost eat us up, our best Men are killed in this bloody War;
but we now forget what is past. Before this we once threw the Hatchet
into the River of
Kaihohage
[40]
, but you fished it up, and
treacherously surprised our People at
Cadarackui
. After this you sent
to us to have our Prisoners restored; then the Hatchet was thrown up to
the Sky, but you kept a String fastened to the Helve, and pulled it
down, and fell upon our People again. This we revenged to some Purpose,
by the Destruction of your People and Houses in the Island of

Montreal
.

"Now we are come to cover the Blood from our Sight, which has been shed
by both Sides during this long War.

"
Onondio
, we have been at War a long Time, we now give you a Medicine
to drive away all ill Thoughts from your Heart, to purge it and make it
clean, and restore it to its former State.

"
Onondio
, we will not permit any Settlement at
Cadarackui
; you have
had your Fire there thrice extinguished; we will not consent to your
rebuilding that Fort, but the Passage through the River shall be free
and clear. We make the Sun clean, and drive away all Clouds and
Darkness, that we may see the Light without Interruption.

"
Onondio
, we have taken many Prisoners from one another, during the
War. The Prisoners we took have been delivered, according to our Custom,
to the Families that have lost any in the War. They no longer belong to
the Publick, they may give them back if they please, your People may do
the same. We have brought back two Prisoners, and restore them to you.

"After I had finished what I had to say, continued he, the Governor of

Canada
told me, that he would not make Peace with
Cayenguirago
. To
this I answered, these Words displease me much, you shall keep Peace
with him.
Onondio
said again, I must fight with
Cayenguirago
, it is
not in my Power to make Peace; this can only be done by my Master, who
lives over the great Water. To this I replied, I cannot bear this
Discourse; if you should fight him now, and not stay till I get Home,
all the Country will look on me as a Traytor; I can treat with you no
longer. The Argument on this Subject lasted three Days, at last the
Governor of
Canada
assured me, that he would not undertake any
Enterprize against
Cayenguirago
this Summer, but would wait to hear
what he wou'd say.

"The Governor of
Canada
insisted three Days to have Hostages left,
which I refused, but two agreeing of their own accord to stay, they were
left,
viz
. one an
Onondago
, another a
Seneka
.

"Then the Governor of
Canada
made the following publick Answer:

"I. I accept of Peace as you offer.

"II. Son, bring all the Prisoners back that you have taken from me, and
yours shall have Liberty to return Home, if they please.

"III. Children, erect my Fire again at
Cadarackui
, and plant there the
Tree of Peace.

"After this the Governor of
Canada
delivered me a Belt, which I now
lay down before you; by it he said, desire
Cayenguirago
to send a wise
Man to me, and he shall have Protection according to the Custom of
Christians; and added,

"Children of the
Five Nations
, if
Cayenguirago
shall employ you to
do any Service for him, do not accept of it, let him send his own
People."

Decanesora
added, that the Governor of
Canada
had fixed eighty Days
for a Return to this Belt.

He continued and said, "The
Sachems
of the
Dionondadies
were
present; after I had finished my Speech, they said; May what you have
now said be from your Hearts; we suspect you are not sincere; let us no
longer feel the Smart of the Hatchet, and gave this Belt which I now lay
down.

"The
Praying Indians
next said, Brethren, our Father
Onondio
has
told you to bring Home all the Prisoners, do not fail in this;
giving
two Belts
.

"Brother
Cayenguirago
, you will find what I have now said confirmed by
this Paper, which the Governor of
Canada
gave me. I brought Letters
likewise for the Jesuit
Milet
, who was to read the Paper to us." The
Paper contained the Articles in
French
, in which the Governor of

Canada
was willing to make Peace.

But besides what
Decanesora
here tells, the
French
Accounts say,
that he brought two Belts underground (that is privately) from three

Onondaga Sachems
, to assure the Governor of
Canada
of their
particular Affection, which the Governor of
Canada
answered, by a
private Belt to them.

As soon as
Decanesora
had done speaking, Colonel
Fletcher
rejected
the Belt sent by the Governor of
Canada
, saying; If the Governor of

Canada
have any Thing to say to me, let him send some of his People to

Albany
, and they shall have Protection.

Next Day
Sadekanahtie
, after he had sung a long Song, gave the
following Account of their Negotiations with the
Dewagunhas
and

Dionondadies
, which they had undertaken by the Governor's Advice.

"We were afraid, says he, to send Messengers of our own People,
and therefore we employed two Prisoners we had of the

Dionondadies
with the Governor's Belt. Some time after this,
some of the
Senekas
hunting near the
Dionondadies
, two of
them were taken; but when they were carried to the
Dionondadie

Castle, they were not treated like Prisoners; they were used
kindly, and sent back with the following Offers of Peace.

"We are glad to see you Face to Face to speak to you, since the
Sun has been so propitious to send home the Men that were
Prisoners with you, giving a few Strings of Wampum.

"We are glad of this Opportunity to tell you, that we have been
both drunk in making War on one another; we now give you a
Cordial to ease your Hearts, that there be no longer War between
us, by
this Belt
.

"We are glad that you have set the Doors open as far as

Cayenguirago
's House, that we may freely go thither. Carry him

this second Belt
.

"Brethren, we thank you for having prepared a Place for us at
your General Council of
Onondaga
. Our Country is every where
free to you to treat with us, by
this third Belt
.

"Brethren, our whole Country rejoiced when you invited us into
your Country, and from thence to go where
Cayenguirago
dwells;
be not afraid to come to our Country, you shall meet with no
Molestation.

"Brethren, we thank you for putting us in Mind of what was
formerly agreed to,
viz
. that when any ill Accident happens,
we were to meet together to compose Matters, and not to revenge
it with War. We are now together to put an End to all
Misunderstanding, by
this fourth Belt
.

"Brethren, (we include all the Nations from the
Senekas

Country to
New-York
in this Name) hearken to us. We rend the
Clouds asunder, and drive away all Darkness from the Heavens,
that the Sun of Peace may shine with Brightness over us all;

giving a Sun
of a round red polished Stone.

"Brethren, we put the Hatchet into the Hands of the

Chightaghies
,
Twithtwies
, and
Odsirachies
, to war against
you; but we shall in three Days go to these Nations and take the
Hatchet out of their Hands;
giving half a Stone Pipe
.

"You
Senekas
are stupid Creatures, we must therefore warn you
not to hunt so far from your Castles, lest you be hurt by any of
these three Nations, and then blame us. They then
gave the other
half of the Pipe
.

"But Brother
Cayenguirago
, says
Sadakahnitie
, do not suffer
these Nations to come nearer than the
Senekas
Country, lest
they discover our Weakness, and to what a low Condition the War
has reduced us. These Nations have been so long in Friendship
with the
French
, and are so much under their Influence, that
we cannot trust them yet, or be too much upon our Guard against
them."

Colonel
Fletcher
not being able to give the
Five Nations
any
Assurance of a vigorous Assistance, he called the principal
Sachems
to
a private Conference on the twentieth. He asked them, whether they had
made Peace with the Governor of
Canada
; they answered, that it only
wanted his Approbation, and added, that they could no longer carry on
the War without Assistance. You have the whole Negotiations before you,
say they, and we submit it to your Prudence.

He then allowed them to make Peace, provided they kept faithful in their
Chain with the
English
; but told them, that as to his Part he could
make no Peace with the Governor of
Canada
. They were under great
Uneasiness to leave their Friends in the War, they said, and wished,
since neither the Governor of
Canada
nor he would receive Proposals by
their Hands, that they might think of some neutral Place to treat. The
Governor answered, that he could neither receive nor send any Message on
that Head; and that Peace could be only made between them by the two
Kings.

The Governor next asked them, whether they would permit the
French
to
build again at
Cadarackui
; they answered, they would never permit it,
and were resolved to insist on it, in all the ensuing Treaties, that he
never shall. Then the Governor added, if you permit the French to build
any where on that Lake, there will be an End to your Liberty, your
Posterity will become Slaves to the
French
. If ever you should permit
them, I will look on it as an absolute Breach of the Chain with us: If
the
French
attempt it give me Notice, and I will march the whole Force
of my Government to your Assistance. We shall find afterwards, however,
that the Government of
New-York
was far from making good this Promise.

The Governor told them, that they had lost much of their Honour in
creeping to the
French
, in such an abject Manner; for, says he, the
Governor of
Canada
's Paper, which you brought with you, says, that you
came in the most humble and penitent Manner, and begged Peace. To which
they answered, the Governor of
Canada
has no Reason to make such
Reflexions, we have many of his Belts to shew, by which he again and
again sued to us for Peace, before we would hearken to him. But, replies
the Governor, how came you to call him Father? For no other Reason, they
replied, but because he calls us Children. These Names signify nothing.

They desired the Governor not to say any Thing particularly of

Cadarackui
, in his publick Speech that he was to make next Day, for
they had, they said, some among them that would tell all to the Governor
of
Canada
; and concluded, with wishing that they had some one, who
could write and read all that the Governor had said to them, that they
might not forget any Part of it, when they come to consult and resolve
on this weighty Affair, at their General Council at
Onondaga
.

Here we see these Barbarians, these Savages, as we call them, acting
with the greatest regard to the Treaties they had entered into with
their Allies, and that at a Time when the Exigences of their own
Affairs, and when the faint feeble Assistance, which their Allies had
contributed in the common Cause, would, among Christian Potentates, have
been thought a sufficient Excuse for their taking Care of themselves
separately, in breach of the most solemn Confederacy they could enter
into.

The
Sachems
of the
Five Nations
being met at
Onondaga
, to consult
on the Terms offered by the
French
, they were divided in their
Opinions; the
Cayugas
, and Part of the
Senekas
, were most favourable
to the
French
Proposals; but the major Part was absolutely against
allowing the
French
to rebuild a Fort at
Cadarackui
, nor would they
consent to include all the
French
Allies in the Treaty, with some of
which they had particular Causes of Animosity.

The Party that was most for Peace obtained Leave to go to
Canada
, to
try whether they could obtain Terms less disagreeable. They accordingly
went thither, within the Time prefixed by the Governor of
Canada
, for
an Answer; and to make themselves more acceptable to the
French
, they
carried thirteen Prisoners with them, and delivered them up. The Jesuit

Milet
was of this Number, who had been taken in the Year 1689, and one

Jonscaire
, who had been long a Prisoner among the
Senekas
: He had
been delivered up to a Family of the
Senekas
, that had lost some
considerable Relation, and was by them adopted. He ingratiated himself
so much with that Nation, that he was advanced to the Rank of a

Sachem
, and preserved their Esteem to the Day of his Death; whereby
he became, after the general Peace, very useful to the
French
in all
Negotiations with the
Five Nations
, and to this Day they shew their
Regard to his Family and Children.

When the Governor of
Canada
came to Particulars with these Deputies,
he could obtain nothing but ambiguous or dubious Answers, as to the
rebuilding of
Cadarackui Fort
, and the including of all the
French

Allies in the Peace. Whereupon he dismissed them with Presents, and made
them many fair Promises, in Case of their Compliance; but threatened
them with utter Destruction, in Case of their refusing the Terms he had
offered. Many of the
French Indian
Allies were present, when the
Governor of
Canada
refused any Agreement without his Allies being
included in it, and this attached them exceedingly to the
French

Interest. This Regard, which the
French
generally shew for the
Interest of their Allies, is a Piece of Policy which, upon all
Occasions, proves useful to them; whereas, the Neglect of this Piece of
natural Justice has as often been prejudicial to others, who have not
had so tender a Sense of it. But it is not so easy for a weak State to
keep up its Honour in such Cases, as it is for a powerful Prince.

CHAP. XI.

The War renewed
.
The
French
repossess themselves of
Cadarackui

Fort
,
and find Means to break off the Treaty between the
Five
Nations
and
Dionondadies.

T
he
Five Nations
refusing to come to the Governor of
Canada
's Terms,
he resolved to force them; and as he suspected that they continued
obstinate, by the Advice of the
English
, and the Confidence they had
of the
English
Assistance, he thought he would most effectually lessen
that Confidence, by attacking and destroying the remainder of the

Mohawks
, who liv'd adjoining to the
English
Settlements. For this
Purpose he resolved to march, in the Winter, the whole Force of
Canada

against that Nation; but one of the Prisoners learning their Design,
made his Escape, and informed the
Mohawks
of it. This made him alter
his Measures, knowing well enough, that if the
English
were prepared
to receive them, such an Enterprize would only lead those engaged in it
to certain Destruction. He then sent three hundred Men into the Neck of
Land between
Lake Erie
and
Cadarackui Lake
, the usual hunting Place
of the
Five Nations
, in hopes of surprising them while they hunted
carelessly there, and at the same Time to view the old
French
Fort
there, to observe in what Condition it remained.

This Party met with three or four Men, who defended themselves
obstinately, till they all fell dead on the Spot. They surprised
likewise a Cabin, where they took some Men and Women Prisoners; and four
of them were publickly burnt alive at
Montreal
. So far the Count
de
Frontenac
thought it more proper to imitate the
Indians
in their most
savage Cruelties, than to instruct them, by his Example, in the
Compassion of the Christian Doctrine. A Party of one hundred and fifty
of the
Five Nations
fell upon the
Dewagunhas
, in their Way to

Canada
, and entirely routed them. Ten Prisoners were taken, nine of
which were burnt alive, in revenge of the same Fate the four Men of the

Five Nations
had received at
Montreal
.

This Year also some sculking
French Indians
murdered some People near

Albany
and
Schenectady
.

The Party sent to view
Cadarackui Fort
found it in a better Condition
than they expected, the
Indians
having neglected to demolish and level
the Bastions, and probably they had not Instruments sufficient to do it.
The Count
de Frontenac
therefore, in the Summer of the Year 1695, sent
a considerable Body of Men, both
French
and
Indians
, thither, to
repair the Fortifications, and to cover those that should be at work.
The
Five Nations
, in
August
, sent Messengers to
Albany
, to
acquaint the
English
that the
French
had taken Possession of

Cadarackui
, and were repairing of it. They demanded, in Consequence of
the Promise Colonel
Fletcher
had given them, the Assistance of five
hundred Men and some Cannon, which they promised they would draw over
Land, where they could not be carried by Water. At the same Time they
desired, that the People of
New-England
might be told, that many of
the
Owenagungas
were gone with the
French
to
Cadarackui
, and that
this was a proper Time to fall upon those that remained, and to destroy
them, and the Women and Children.

Coll.
Fletcher
came to
Albany
in
September
; there, in a Speech to
the
Five Nations
, he blamed them for being asleep, when they suffered
the
French
to take Possession of
Cadarackui
; it would have been much
easier, he said, to have prevented their getting the Possession, than to
drive them out, now they are in it, especially as now you yourselves are
convinced, that it is impossible to carry Cannon thither from this
Place. All, says he, I can now do, is to advise you to invest the Place
with your Parties, so as to prevent their receiving any Supply of
Provisions: By this Means you may force them to desert it. Then he gave
them 1000 Pound of Powder, two Thousand Pound of Lead, 57 Fusees, one
Hundred Hatchets, three Hundred and forty eight Knives, and two
Thousand Flints, besides Cloathing, &c. But in my Opinion, the
Government of
New-York
have, on all Occasions, been exceedingly to be
blamed, in not having some Men of Experience among the
Five Nations
to
advise and direct them on all Emergencies of Importance. The
French

are very careful of this, and the
Officers
of the regular Troops are
obliged to take their Tours among their
Indians
, while the Captains of
the independent Companies of Fusiliers at
New-York
live like military
Monks, in Idleness and Luxury.

The
French
gained a great Advantage, by possessing this Place, as it
is of great Security to their Traders, in their passing between

Montreal
and
Missilimakinak
. It served likewise as a Place of
Stores, and Retreat in all their Enterprizes against the
Five Nations
,
that Place being nearly about half Way between
Montreal
and the
Country of the
Five Nations
. It likewise exposed the
Five Nations
in
their hunting, to the Incursions of that Garison, by its being in the
Neighbourhood of their principal hunting Place for Bever.

The
French
grew exceedingly uneasy, when they found, that the

Dionondadies
, who live near
Missilimakinak
, had almost concluded a
Peace with the
Five Nations
, and that the rest of their Allies were
like to follow their Example: Some of these Nations had been at

Montreal
, and at their Return forwarded the Peace, that thereby they
might be at Liberty to go to
Albany
; for they informed their
Neighbours, that the
Five Nations
had intirely shut up the Path to

Montreal
; and besides that, the
French
were not in a Condition to
supply them, for they had nothing for themselves, not so much as a Drop
of strong Spirits. If these Nations had, at that Time, deserted the

French
, it might probably have put an End to the
French
Colony; for
as the Lands of
Canada
barely produce sufficient for the Subsistence
of its Inhabitants, the only Means they have of purchasing Cloathing and
other Necessaries is by their Trade with the
Indians
. The
French

likewise had been in Danger of greater Mischief by the Peace, for these
Nations being at War with the
Five Nations
, and lying on the Back of
them, obliged the
Five Nations
to keep always a very considerable Part
of their Force at home, to defend themselves against these Nations, and
to revenge the Injuries they received from them; but if the Peace had
been concluded with these Nations, the
Five Nations
could have turned
their whole Force against
Canada
, and probably might have persuaded
these Nations to have joined with them in warring on the
French
.

The
French
Commandant at
Missilimakinak
had his Hands full at this
Time; and if he had not been a Man of great Abilities, he must have sunk
under the Difficulties he had to go through; in the first Place, to
contradict the Stories brought from
Montreal
, he ordered the Stores of
his Fort to be sold to the
Indians
at the cheapest Rate, and assured
them, that great Quantities were every Day expected from
France
, which
were only detained by contrary Winds; and after these Goods shall
arrive, said he, they will be sold cheaper than ever they have been. He
told them likewise, that the Count
de Frontenac
would never make Peace
with the
Five Nations
, but was resolved to extirpate them; for which
Purpose he was now rebuilding
Cadarackui Fort
. At the same Time he
took all possible Methods to extinguish the Beginnings of Friendship,
which appeared between the
Five Nations
and
Dionondadies
.

The
Dionondadies
durst not avow their treating with the
Five Nations

to the
French
, neither durst the
Five Nations
trust their Agents in
a Place where they knew the
French
had so great Influence; both Sides
therefore agreed to carry on their Treaty by Means of Prisoners which
they took from one another. The Civility with which the
Dionondadies

treated these Prisoners, their dismissing them, and their receiving
again Prisoners which had been taken by the
Five Nations
, gave the
Commandant sufficient Ground to suspect what was doing. The

Dionondadies
at last took seven Men of the
Five Nations
Prisoners,
and carried them to
Missilimakinak
. The
French
perceiving, by their
Manner of bringing them in, that the
Dionondadies
intended to treat
them with the Civility they had lately used to others, murdered two of
them with their Knives as they stept ashore. On this the
Dionondadies

immediately took to their Arms, saved the other Five, and carried them
safe to their Castle; and continuing in Arms, threatened Revenge for the
Insult they had received.

The
French
were forced in like Manner to stand to their Arms, and as
there are always many different Nations at
Missilimakinak
trading,
some of which were inveterate Enemies of the
Five Nations
, they joined
with the
French
. The
Utawawas
stood neuter. This gave the Commandant
Means of ending the Dispute by Composition. He in the first Place
assured them, that the Christians abhorred all Manner of Cruelty, and
then told them, that as the
French
shared with the
Dionondadies
in
all the Dangers and Losses sustained by the War, they ought in like
Manner to partake with them in any Advantage. The
Dionondadies
on this
were persuaded to deliver up one of the Prisoners. What I am about to
relate, I think, gives Room to charge the
French
with a Piece of
Policy, not only inconsistent with the Christian Religion, but likewise
with the Character of a polite People; and that all Considerations from
Religion, Honour, and Virtue, must give Way to the present Exigencies of
their Affairs. That an End might be put to the Beginnings of a
Reconciliation between these People and the
Five Nations
, the
French

gave a publick Invitation to feast on the Soup to be made on this
Prisoner, and, in a more particular Manner, invited the
Utawawas
to
the Entertainment.

The Prisoner being first made fast to a Stake, so as to have Room to
move round it, a
Frenchman
began the horrid Tragedy, by broiling the
Flesh of the Prisoner's Legs, from his Toes to his Knees, with the red
hot Barrel of a Gun; his Example was followed by an
Utawawa
, and they
relieved one another as they grew tired. The Prisoner all this while
continued his Death Song, till they clapt a red hot Frying-pan on his
Buttocks, when he cried out, Fire is strong and too powerful; then all
their
Indians
mocked him, as wanting Courage and Resolution. You, they
said, a Soldier and a Captain, as you say, and afraid of Fire; you are
not a Man. They continued their Torments for two Hours without ceasing.
An
Utawawa
being desirous to outdo the
French
in their refined
Cruelty, split a Furrow from the Prisoner's Shoulder to his Garter, and
filling it with Gunpowder, set Fire to it. This gave him exquisite Pain,
and raised excessive Laughter in his Tormenters. When they found his
Throat so much parched, that he was no longer able to gratify their Ears
with his howling, they gave him Water, to enable him to continue their
Pleasure longer. But at last his Strength failing, an
Utawawa
flead
off his Scalp, and threw burning hot Coals on his Scull. Then they
untied him, and bid him run for his Life: He began to run, tumbling like
a drunken Man; they shut up the Way to the East, and made him run
Westward, the Country, as they think, of departed (miserable) Souls. He
had still Force left to throw Stones, till they put an End to his Misery
by knocking him on the Head with a Stone. After this every one cut a
Slice from his Body, to conclude the Tragedy with a Feast. It is doing
no Injury, I think, to these
Frenchmen
, who thus glory in this horrid
Cruelty, to ask them, whether they did not likewise regale their
revengeful Appetites with a Share of this inhuman Feast?

Though I have had frequent Occasions to mention these barbarous inhuman
Cruelties, transacted by the
Indians
, yet I have avoided to relate the
particular Circumstances of them, because I believe few civilized Ears
can bear the reading of them without Horror. But when they are
perpetrated by Christians, and so far gloried in, as to be recorded in
their own History, I am willing to shew it to my Countrymen in its
proper Colours. This last Piece of
French
History is taken from

Histoire de l'Amerique Septentrionale, par Monsr. de la Poterie
,
published at
Paris
with the Royal Licence, and recommended to the
Publick by Mons.
Fontenelle
, Vol. ii. Page 298.

Though this cruel Act had its designed Effect, in breaking off this
Method of negotiating between the
Five Nations
and
Dionondadies
, it
did not prevent the Peace; and it had very near raised a Civil War with
their own
Indians
, which was only prevented by the dextrous Conduct of
the
French
Officers, who, in all kind of Artifice, have always been
superior to the
Indians
. But let me observe on this Occasion, that
the avoiding any Misfortune, by any base or wicked Action, is commonly
the Cause of greater Mischiefs than what is thereby avoided; and of this
numerous Examples may be given.

CHAP. XII.

The Count
de Frontenac
attacks
Onondaga
in Person
,
with the whole
Force of
Canada.
The
Five Nations
continue the War with the
French,

and make Peace with the
Dionondadies.

T
he Count
de Frontenac
having secured
Cadarackui Fort
, which was
called by his Name, as a Place of Arms and Provisions, and for a Retreat
to the Men that should happen to be sick or wounded, resolved to make
the
Five Nations
feel his Resentment of their refusing his Terms of
Peace. For this Purpose he assembled all the regular Troops of
Canada
,
the Militia, the
Owenagungas
, the
Quatoghies
of
Loretto
, the

Adirondacks
,
Sokokies
,
Nepiciriniens
, the
Praying Indians
of the

Five Nations
, and a few
Utawawas
, at
Montreal
, in
June
1696. The
other western
Indians
near
Missilimakinak
, by their late
Correspondence with the
Five Nations
, and the Dissatisfaction they had
manifested, were not trusted. The Manner of making War with the

Indians
in a Country wholly covered with Woods, must be so much
different from the Methods used in
Europe
, that I believe the Reader
will be pleased to have a particular Account of the Count
de
Frontenac
's Conduct in this, who was an old experienced General, in the
seventy fourth Year of his Age.

It is to be observed, that it is impossible to pass the vast Forests
between the Countries of the
Five Nations
with Waggons, or other
Carriages, or on Horseback, or even on Foot, in the summer Time, by
Reason of many impassible thick Swamps and Morasses. For this Reason,
the only Method of travelling is in Bark Canoes, or very light Battoes,
along the Rivers, which may be easily carried on Men's Shoulders, where
the Stream of the River becomes too rapid, and from one River to
another; for which Purpose the shortest Passes are always chosen, and
are called, for this Reason, Carrying Places.

The Count
de Frontenac
marched from
la Chine
, in the south End of
the Island of
Montreal
, the fourth of
July
. He divided five hundred

Indians
so, that the greatest Number of them should always be in the
Van, which consisted of two Battalions of the regular Troops. They were
followed by the Canoes which carried the Provisions. The Van was
commanded by the Chevalier
de Callieres
, Governor of
Montreal
; he
had with him two large Battoes, which carried two small Pieces of
Cannon, small Mortars, Granadoes, and the Utensils of the Artillery. The
Count
de Frontenac
was at the Head of the main Body, accompanied by
the Engineer and several Gentlemen Voluntiers. The Body consisted of
four Battalions of the Militia, who, in War with
Indians
, were then
more depended on than the regular Troops; these were commanded by
Monsieur
Ramsay
, Governor of
Trois Rivieres
. The Rear, which
consisted of two Battalions of regular Troops, and of the rest of the

Indians
, was under the Command of the Chevalier
de Vaudreuil
. All
the
Indians
had
French
Officers set over them.

In this Order the Army marched, only those that were in the Van one Day,
were in the Rear the next; and they always kept a Number of
Indians
on
the Scout, to discover the Tracks of the Enemy, for fear of Ambuscades.
And when they were obliged to carry the Canoes, and drag the large
Battoes, several Parties were detached to cover the Men that worked.

After twelve Days March they arrived at
Cadarackui Fort
, one hundred
eighty Miles from
Montreal
. Here they waited for the
Utawawas
, who
disappointed them; and in the mean Time raised a Bark, which had
remained sunk since
Cadarackui Fort
was deserted. They crossed over

Cadarackui
Lake to
Onondaga
River (now
Ohswega
). This River being
narrow and rapid, they ordered fifty Men to march on each Side of it, to
prevent their being surprised, and the Army moved slowly along the
River, according to the Intelligence they received from their Scouts.
They found a Tree, as they passed along, on which the
Indians
had, in
their Manner, painted the
French
Army, and had laid by it two Bundles
of cut Rushes. This was a Defiance in the
Indian
Manner, and to tell
them by the Number of Rushes, that fourteen hundred thirty four Men
would meet them. The
French
passed the little Lake, between
Ohswega

and
Onondaga
, in Order of Battle; and the two Wings, to prevent their
being surprised, and to make the Place of their Landing more uncertain
to the Enemy, took a Circuit along the Coast. As soon as they had landed
they raised a Fort. A
Seneka
, who had been some time a Prisoner in

Canada
, and pretended an Attachment to the
French
, was sent out to
make a Discovery. He deserted to the
Onondagas
. He found them waiting
for the
French
, with a Resolution to defend their Castle, and to fight
the
French
; for which Purpose they had sent away their Women and
Children. The
Seneka
told them that the
French
Army was as numerous
as the Leaves on the Trees; that they had Machines which threw Balls up
in the Air, and which falling on their Castle burst to Pieces, and
spread Fire and Death every where, against which their Stockadoes could
be of no Defence. This was confirmed by another
Seneka
, who deserted.
Upon which the
Onondagas
thought it most adviseable to retire, leaving
their poor Fort and bark Cottages all in Flames.

After the General had an Account of this, he marched to their Village in
Order of Battle. The Army was divided into two Lines: The first
commanded by the Chevalier
de Callieres
, who placed himself on the
Left, consisted of two Battalions of the Inhabitants in the Center, and
a Battalion of the regular Troops on each Wing. The Artillery followed
them. Most of the
Indians
of this Division were upon the Right, who
continually sent out Scouts. The second Line was commanded by the
Chevalier
de Vaudreuel
, composed of the same Number of Battalions, and
in the same Order. The Count
de Frontenac
was carried in a Chair
directly after the Artillery. But it was impossible for them to keep
their Order, in passing through thick Woods, and in passing Brooks. In
this formidable Manner the aged General marched up to the Ashes of the
Village, and his Army exerted their Fury on the
Indian
Corn, which
covered a large Field in thick Ranks.

An
Indian Sachem
, about one hundred Years old, would not retire with
the rest, but chose this Time to end his Days. The
French Indians
had
the Pleasure of tormenting him, which he bore with surprising Evenness
of Mind, and with that Resolution which becomes a
Sachem
of the
Five
Nations
. He told his Tormentors to remember well his Death, when his
Countrymen should come to take terrible Vengeance of them. Upon which,
one stabbing him several Times with his Knife, he thanked him but said,
you had better make me die by Fire, that these Dogs of
Frenchmen
may
learn how to suffer like Men. You
Indians
, their Allies, you Dogs of
Dogs, think of me when you shall be in the like State. Thus this old

Sachem
, under all the Weakness of old Age, preserved a Greatness of
Soul, and a due Regard for the Honour of his Country, to the last Moment
of his Breath.

The Chevalier
de Vaudreuil
was sent with a Detachment of six or seven
hundred Men to destroy the
Oneydoes
Corn, who liv'd but a small
Distance from
Onondaga
, which he performed without any Resistance. The
Jesuit
Milet
had lived for the most Part with the
Oneydoes
; he had
infused into them the most favourable Sentiments of the
French
, and
they had been the most inclined to Peace on the
French
Terms. Thirty
five of them staid in their Castle to make the
French
welcome; but the
only Favour they obtained, was to be made Prisoners, and carried to

Montreal
. The
French
Governor declared his Resolutions to extirpate
the
Onondagas
, and for that Reason gave Orders to give no Quarter.

The Difficulty of supporting so many Men in these Deserts, made it
necessary for the Count
de Frontenac
to return as speedily as
possible. Though the
French
Army was much an Overmatch for the

Onondagas
, both in Number of Men and in their Arms, the
Onondagas

were not so far dispirited, as not to follow them in their Return. They
found Opportunities to revenge themselves in some Measure, by cutting
off every Canoe that happened at any Time to be at a Distance from the
main Body. This obliged the Count to hasten his March, so that he
returned to
Montreal
the tenth of
August
.

The
Onondagas
suffered nothing by this chargeable Expedition, but the
Loss of their Corn, and their Bark Cottages. They lost not one Man, but
the old
Sachem
, who resolved to die a Martyr to his Country's Honour.
The
French
suffered considerably by its Consequences; for all the
Planters being taken off from their Labour, either in this Expedition,
or in watching and securing their Forts and Country, a Famine ensued;
and this I find has often happened in
Canada
, where all the Men, fit
to bear Arms, have been employed in such like Expeditions. If the

Oneydoes
had not timely surrendered themselves, the Count had not been
able to have carried Home the least Token of a Victory. And all that can
be said for this Enterprize is, that it was a kind of heroick Dotage.

The Influence that the Jesuit
Milet
had obtained over the
Oneydoes

was such, that some Time after this, thirty of them deserted to the

French
, and desired that he might be appointed their Pastor.

In the following Winter the
Mohawks
, with the Governor of
New York
's
Privacy,
sent one to the
Praying Indians
with two Belts
, and he
carried two Prisoners with him. By the first Belt he asked, whether the
Path was entirely shut up between their two Countries; and, by the
second, demanded the Restitution of a Prisoner the
Praying Indians
had
taken: But his real Design was, to learn the State of their Country, and
what Designs were forming. Notwithstanding the Influence and Artifice of
the
French
Priests over these Converts, they still retained an
Affection to their Countrymen; for which Reason the Count
de Frontenac

entertained a Jealousy of these Intercourses, and threatened to put to
Death any that should come in that Manner again; but the Messenger had
the Satisfaction of discovering the distressed Condition of
Canada
by
Famine.

A Party of the
French
was sent out in the Winter, to make some Attempt
upon the
English
Settlements near
Albany
; but some
Mohawks
and

Scahkook Indians
meeting with them, before they reached the
Settlements, they were intirely routed. The commanding Officer, one
du
Bau
, and two others, saved themselves from the Fury of the
Indians
,
by running to
Albany
; the rest were either killed or perished in the
Woods, so that not one Man of this Party got back to
Canada
.

It was much easier for the
French
to set the
Praying Indians
upon
the
English
, against whom it is possible many of them had personal
Animosities, that made them go over to the
French
, than to fight their
Countrymen. Several of them came this Winter skulking about

Schenectady
and
Albany
; and being well acquainted with the Country,
and speaking likewise the
Mohawk
's Language, by which they sometimes
deceived the Inhabitants, they surprised some of the Inhabitants, and
carried away their Scalps.

The
Five Nations
, to shew that the Count
de Frontenac
's Expedition
had no Way discouraged them, sent out several Parties against
Canada
.
One of them met with a Party of
French
upon
St. Laurence River
, near

Montreal
. The
French
were routed, and their Captain killed. As soon
as this was heard at
Montreal
,
Repentigni
was sent out after them
with a considerable Party of
French
,
Nepicirinien Indians
and

Praying Indians
; but this Party was likewise defeated, and the
Captain, with many of his Men, killed.

Thus the War was continued till the Peace of
Reswick
, by small Parties
of
Indians
, on both Sides, harassing, surprising, and scalping the
Inhabitants near
Montreal
and
Albany
.

Some Time this Year the chief
Sachem
of the
Dionondadies
(whom the

French
call the
Baron
) went to
Quebeck
, pretending a strong
Attachment to the
French
, but really to conceal the Treaty of Peace
that he was on the Point of concluding with the
Five Nations
; for
which Purpose he had
sent his Son with nineteen Belts
to the
Senekas
.
The Substance of whose Commission was as follows:

The
French
have for many Years confounded our Resolutions, and
deceived us, but now we are resolved to break all their Artifices, by
stopping our Ears. We come now to unite with you, while the
French

know nothing of the Matter. The Commandant at
Missilimakinak
has told
us many Lies, he has betrayed us, and made us kill one another, but we
are firmly resolved never to hearken to him any more. The Peace was
accordingly firmly concluded, notwithstanding all the Opposition the

French
could make. The
French
Authors say, the only Reason that
induced the
Dionondadies
was, that the
English
sold them Goods
cheaper than the
French
could.

Some Time before the News of the Peace arrived, the
French
at

Montreal
being informed that a Party of the
Five Nations
were
discovered near
Corlear's Lake
, sent out a Captain with a Party of
Soldiers and
Indians
, who being well experienced in the Manner of
making War with
Indians
, marched through the thickest Woods, and by
the least frequented Places, so that he discovered the Enemy, without
being discovered. He surprised that Party, killed several, and took one
Prisoner. The
Utawawas
being then trading at
Montreal
, the Count

de Frontenac
invited them to a Feast to be made of this Prisoner, and
caused him to be burnt publickly alive at
Montreal
, in the Manner of
which I have already given two Accounts from the
French
Authors.

CHAP. XIII.

The Conduct which the
English
and
French
observed
,
in regard to
the
Five Nations,
immediately after the Peace of
Reswick.

S
oon after the News of the Peace of
Reswick
reached
New-York
, the
Governor sent an Express to
Canada
, to inform the Governor there of
it, that Hostilities might cease. The
Five Nations
having an Account
of the Peace earlier than they had it in
Canada
, took Advantage of it,
in hunting Bever near
Cadarackui Fort
. The Governor of
Canada
being
informed of this, and believing that the
Five Nations
thought
themselves secure by the general Peace, resolved to take his last
Revenge of them. For this Purpose he sent a considerable Party of

Adirondacks
to surprise them, which they did, and killed several, but
not without Loss of many of their own Men. The Loss of one of their
greatest Captains at that Time gave the
Five Nations
the greatest
Affliction. After he was mortally wounded, he cried out: "Must I, who
have made the whole Earth tremble before me, now die by the Hands of
Children?" for he despised the
Adirondacks
.

A Dispute at this Time arose, between the Government of
New-York
and

Canada
, about the
French
Prisoners which the
Five Nations
had in
their Hands. The Earl of
Bellamont
, then Governor of
New-York
, would
have the
French
receive those Prisoners from him, and directed the

Five Nations
to bring them to
Albany
for that Purpose. The
French
,
on the other Hand, refused to own the
Five Nations
as subject to the
Crown of
Great-Britain
, and threatened to continue the War against the

Five Nations
, if they did not bring the Prisoners to
Montreal
, and
deliver them there. The Count
de Frontenac
sent some of the
Praying
Indians
with a Message to this Purpose, and to have all the
French

Allies included in the general Peace.

The Messenger on his Return told the Count, publickly in Presence of
several
Utawawas
, that the
Five Nations
refused to include several
of his Allies, but were resolved to revenge the Injuries they had
received. The
Utawawas
were exceedingly discomposed at hearing this,
and the Count, to recover their Spirits, assured them, that he never
would make Peace without including all his Allies in it, and without
having all their Prisoners restored. At the same Time he made
Preparations to attack the
Five Nations
with the whole Force of

Canada
.

The Earl of
Bellamont
being informed of this, sent Captain
John
Schuyler
(of the Militia) to tell the Count, that he had the Interest
of the King his Master too much at Heart, to suffer the
French
to
treat the
Five Nations
like Enemies, after the Conclusion of the
general Peace; for which Reason he had ordered them to be on their
Guard, and had furnished them with Arms and Ammunition; that he had
ordered the Lieutenant-Governor, in Case they were attacked, either by
the
French
or their Allies, to join them with the regular Troops; and
that, if he found it necessary, he would raise the whole Force of his
Government in their Defence.

This put a Stop to the
French
Threatening, and both Sides made
Complaint to their Masters. The two Kings ordered their respective
Governors to be assisting to each other, in making the Peace effectual
to both Nations, and to leave the Disputes, as to the Dependency of the

Indian Nations
, to be determined by Commissioners, to be appointed
pursuant to the Treaty of
Reswick
.

It is exceedingly impolitick, when weaker Potentates, ingaged in a
Confederacy against one powerful Prince, leave any Points to be
determined after the Conclusion of a Peace; for if they cannot obtain a
Concession, while the Confederacy stands and their Force is united, how
can a weaker Prince hope to obtain it, when he is left alone to himself,
after the Confederacy is dissolved? The
French
have so often found the
Benefit of this Piece of Imprudence, that in all their Treaties they use
all the Cajoling, and every Artifice in their Power, to obtain this
Advantage, and they seldom miss it.

About the Time of the Conclusion of the Peace at
Reswick
, the noted

Therouet
died at
Montreal
. The
French
gave him Christian Burial in
a pompous Manner, the Priest, that attended him at his Death, having
declared that he died a true Christian; for, said the Priest, while I
explained to him the Passion of our Saviour, whom the
Jews
crucified,
he cried out; "Oh! had I been there, I would have revenged his Death,
and brought away their Scalps."

Soon after the Peace was known at
Montreal
, three considerable Men of
the
Praying Indians
came to
Albany
; they had fine laced Coats given
them, and were invited to return to their own Country. They answered,
that they were young Men, and had not Skill to make a suitable Answer,
and had not their ancient Men to consult with; but promised to
communicate the Proposals to their old Men, and would bring back an
Answer in the Fall. I find nothing more of this in the Register of

Indian Affairs
, though it might have been of great Consequence had it
been pursued to Purpose; but such Matters, where there is not an
immediate private Profit, are seldom pursued by the
English
with that
Care and Assiduity, with which they are by the
French
.

While Captain
Schuyler
was in
Canada
, he entered into some
indiscreet Discourse with Monsieur
Maricour
, for whom the
Five
Nations
had a particular Esteem, and call
Stowtowisse
. Captain

Schuyler
, in asserting the Dependency of the
Five Nations
on

New-York
, said, that those Nations were their Slaves. Mr.
Maricour

told this Discourse to an
Onondaga
, with all the Aggravations he
could, and added, that it was intirely owing to the
English
that the
Peace was not absolutely concluded, and that Captain
Schuyler

prevented their Prisoners being restored, because he would have them
sent to
Albany
, as being Slaves to the
English
. That the
French

had no Dispute with the
English
, but for the Independency of the
Five
Nations
. This indiscreet Conduct of Captain
Schuyler
was so much
resented by the
Five Nations
, that a Deputation of the most
considerable
Sachems
was sent to
Albany
in
June
1699, to complain
of it; and they sent at the same Time Deputies to
Canada
to conclude
the Peace, independently of the
English
. These Deputies that came to

Albany
were so far convinced that the
French
had abused them, and
how much more it was for their Security to be included in the general
Peace with the
English
, than to have only the
French
Faith for their
Security, that they immediately dispatched a Messenger after their
Deputies that were gone to
Canada
. Though this Messenger reached them
too late to stop their Proceeding, it convinced the Deputies so far of
its being for their Interest to be joined with the
English
in the
Peace, as they had been in the War, that they insisted that the
Exchange of Prisoners be made at
Albany
. At the same Time the
Messenger was sent after their Deputies to
Canada
, Colonel
Peter
Schuyler
was sent with others to
Onondaga
, to remove the Prejudices
they had received there.

The Count
de Frontenac
died while these Disputes continued. Monsieur

de Callieres
, who succeeded him, put an End to them, by agreeing to
send to
Onondaga
to regulate the Exchange of Prisoners there; for
which Purpose Monsieur
Maricour
,
Ioncaire
, and the Jesuit
Bruyas
,
were sent.

When the
French
Commissioners were come within less than a Mile of

Onondaga
Castle, they put themselves in Order and marched with the

French
Colours carried before them, and with as much Show as they
could make.
Decanesora
met them without the Gate, and
complimented
them with three Strings of Wampum
. By the first he wiped away their
Tears for the
French
that had been slain in the War. By the second he
opened their Mouths, that they might speak freely; that is, promised
them Freedom of Speech. By the third he cleaned the Matt, on which they
were to sit, from the Blood that had been spilt on both Sides: The
Compliment was returned by the Jesuit, then they entered the Fort, and
were saluted with a general Discharge of all the fire Arms. They were
carried to the best Cabin in the Fort, and there entertained with a
Feast. The Deputies of the several Nations not being all arrived, the
Jesuit, and Monsieur
Maricour
, passed the Time in visiting and
conversing with the
French
Prisoners. The General Council being at
last met, the Jesuit made the following Speech, which I take from the
Relation the
Five Nations
afterwards made of it to the Earl of

Bellamont
.

"1. I am glad to see the
Five Nations
, and that some of them
went to
Canada
, notwithstanding
Corlear
forbid them: I am
sorry for the Loss of your People killed by the remote

Indians
; I condole their Death, and wipe away the Blood by
this Belt.

"2. The War Kettle boiled so long, that it would have scalded
all the
Five Nations
had it continued; but now it is overset,
and turned upside down, and a firm Peace made.

"3. I now plant the Tree of Peace and Welfare at
Onondaga
.

"4. Keep fast the Chain you have made with
Corlear
, for now we
have one Heart and one Interest with them; but why is
Corlear

against your corresponding with us, ought we not to converse
together when we are at Peace and in Friendship?

"5. Deliver up the
French
Prisoners you have, and we shall
deliver not only those of your Nation we have, but all those
likewise taken by any of our Allies; and gave a Belt.

"6. I offer myself to you to live with you at
Onondaga
, to
instruct you in the Christian Religion, and to drive away all
Sickness, Plagues and Diseases out of your Country, and gave a
third Belt.

"7. This last Belt, he said, is from the
Rondaxe
, or
French
Indians
, to desire Restitution of the Prisoners taken from
them."

The Jesuit in the Conclusion said; "Why does not
Corlear
tell
you what passes between the Governor of
Canada
and him? He
keeps you in the Dark, while the Governor of
Canada
conceals
nothing from his Children. Nor does the Governor of
Canada

claim your Land, as
Corlear
does."

The General Council immediately rejected the Belt by which the Jesuit
offered to stay with them, saying, We have already accepted
Corlear's

Belt, by which he offers us Pastors to instruct us.
Decanesora
added,
The Jesuits have always deceived us, for while they preached Peace, the

French
came and knocked us on the Head. To this the Jesuit replied,
that if he had known that
Corlear
intended to send them Pastors, he
would not have offered this Belt.

It is to be observed that the
Indian
Council refused to hear the

French
, or to give them an Answer, but in Presence of the
Commissioners from
Albany
.

The
French
Commissioners having assured the Peace with the
Five
Nations
, the Inhabitants of
Canada
esteemed it the greatest Blessing
that could be procured for them from Heaven; for nothing could be more
terrible than this last War with the
Five Nations
. While this War
lasted, the Inhabitants eat their Bread in continual Fear and Trembling.
No Man was sure, when out of his House, of ever returning to it again.
While they laboured in the Fields, they were under perpetual
Apprehensions of being killed or seized, and carried to the
Indian

Country, there to end their Days in cruel Torments. They many Times were
forced to neglect both their Seed Time and Harvest. The Landlord often
saw all his Land plundered, his Houses burnt, and the whole Country
ruined, while they thought their Persons not safe in their
Fortifications. In short, all Trade and Business was often at an intire
Stand, while Fear, Despair, and Misery appeared in the Faces of the poor
Inhabitants.

The
French
Commissioners carried several of the principal
Sachems
of
the
Five Nations
back with them, who were received at
Montreal
with
great Joy. They were saluted by a Discharge of all the great Guns round
the Place, as they entered. The
French
Allies took this amiss, and
asked if their Governor was entering. They were told, that it was a
Compliment paid to the
Five Nations
, whose
Sachems
were then
entering the Town. We perceive, they replied, that Fear makes the

French
shew more Respect to their Enemies, than Love can make them do
to their Friends.

Monsieur
de Callieres
assembled all the
French
Allies, (who were
then very numerous at
Montreal
) to make the Exchange of Prisoners, and
they delivered the Prisoners they had taken, though the
Five Nations

had sent none to be exchanged for them. Thus we see a brave People
struggle with every Difficulty, till they can get out of it with Honour;
and such People always gain Respect, even from their most inveterate
Enemies.

I shall finish this Part by observing, that notwithstanding the
French

Commissioners took all the Pains possible to carry Home the
French
,
that were Prisoners with the
Five Nations
, and they had full Liberty
from the
Indians
, few of them could be persuaded to return. It may be
thought that this was occasioned from the Hardships they had endured in
their own Country, under a tyrannical Government and a barren Soil: But
this certainly was not the only Reason; for the
English
had as much
Difficulty to persuade the People, that had been taken Prisoners by the

French Indians
, to leave the
Indian
Manner of living, though no
People enjoy more Liberty, and live in greater Plenty, than the common
Inhabitants of
New-York
do. No Arguments, no Intreaties, nor Tears of
their Friends and Relations, could persuade many of them to leave their
new
Indian
Friends and Acquaintance; several of them that were by the
Caressings of their Relations persuaded to come Home, in a little Time
grew tired of our Manner of living, and run away again to the
Indians
,
and ended their Days with them. On the other Hand,
Indian
Children
have been carefully educated among the
English
, cloathed and taught,
yet, I think, there is not one Instance, that any of these, after they
had Liberty to go among their own People, and were come to Age, would
remain with the
English
, but returned to their own Nations, and became
as fond of the
Indian
Manner of Life as those that knew nothing of a
civilized Manner of living. What I now tell of Christian Prisoners among

Indians
, relates not only to what happened at the Conclusion of this
War, but has been found true on many other Occasions.

FOOTNOTES:

[1]
This will appear by several Instances in the Second Part of
this History.

[2]

Wampum
is the Current Money among the
Indians:
It is of
two Sorts, White and Purple; the White is worked out of the Inside of
the great Conques into the Form of a Bead, and perforated, to string on
Leather; the Purple is worked out of the Inside of the Muscle Shell;
they are wove as broad as one's Hand, and about two Feet long; these
they call Belts, and give and receive at their Treaties as the Seals of
Friendship; for lesser Matters a single String is given. Every Bead is
of a known Value, and a Belt of a less Number, is made to equal one of a
greater, by so many as is wanting fastened to the Belt by a String.

[3]
It is still a Custom among the
Indians
, to expiate Murder
by Presents to the Relations of the Person killed.

They are called
Shaouonons
, by the
French
, and live now
on one of the Banks of the Misissipi.

It is a Custom among the
Indian
Prisoners of War, when
led to Death, to sing an Account of their own Exploits; and this they
are hardy enough to continue even in the midst of Tortures.

[14]
The
French Priests
had, from Time to Time, persuaded
several of the
Five Nations
to leave their own Country, and to settle
near
Montreal
; where the
French
are very industrious in encouraging
them. Their Numbers have been likewise increased by the Prisoners the

French
have taken in War, and by others that have run from their own
Country; because of some Mischief that they had done, or Debts which
they owed the Christians. These
Indians
are all profess'd Papists, and
for that Reason are commonly called the
praying Indians
by their
Countrymen, and they are called
Cahnuagas
by the People of
Albany
,
from the Place where they live; the
French
value them on Account of
the Intelligence they give in Time of War, and their Knowledge of the
Countries.

The
Calumet
is a large smoaking Pipe made of Marble,
most commonly of a dark red, well polished, shaped somewhat in the Form
of a Hatchet, and adorned with large Feathers of several Colours. It is
used in all the
Indian
Treaties with Strangers, and as a Flag of Truce
between contending Parties, which all the
Indians
think a very high
Crime to violate. These
Calumets
are generally of nice Workmanship,
and were in Use before the
Indians
knew any Thing of the Christians;
for which Reason we are at a Loss to conceive by what Means they pierced
these Pipes, and shaped them so finely, before they had the Use of
Iron.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

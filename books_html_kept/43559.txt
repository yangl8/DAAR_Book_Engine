Descriptions, with plans, of the several wards, with the names
and addresses of the members of the vestry representing them, of
the auditors of the accounts, and of the officers, as required by
the Act to be given in each report, will be found in the Appendix
No. 1 (pages 28 to 36).

At Easter, 1860, the usual election of churchwardens,
sidesmen, church trustees, and auditors of the church
trustees’ accounts took place; their names and addresses,
together with those of the persons previously nominated as fit to
serve the office of overseers of the poor, and submitted for the
choice of the magistrates in special sessions, will be found in
the Appendix No. 3, (page 37).

p. 4
The
vestry on Easter Tuesday also elected John Moore Segar, son of
John Moore Segar deceased, for admission into the parochial
charity school, pursuant to the will of the late John
Chamberlayne, Esquire.

The return usually ordered by the board previous to the annual
election, showing the attendances of each member, is reprinted in
the Appendix No. 2 (and faces page 36); but as the period
embraced in that return does not entirely correspond with the
parochial year, the tabular arrangement commenced in the last
report is continued:—

A list of the members who have served upon the various
committees, and sub-committees, during the year, is given in the
Appendix No. 4 (pages 38 to 41); and the list annually issued by
the vestry clerk, containing the names and places of abode of the
parochial clergy and lay officers, immediately follows it.
Appendix No. 5 (pages 42 to 46).

In November, 1860, in consequence of the numerous additional
matters connected with the new building, into which the vestry
had now removed, requiring the hall-keeper’s attention, the
clerk reported that the messenger’s duties were not
satisfactorily performed, and the subject being referred to one
of the standing committees for consideration, a youth was
appointed upon their recommendation at ten shillings per week to
commence with.

During this year the vestry have contemplated some alterations
in the salaries of the officers, and upon the application of Mr.
J. E. Salway, one of the office clerks, for increased
remuneration, in December, 1860, referred the whole question of
their duties and salaries to the committee of works and for
general purposes for consideration.  That committee for the
purpose of comparison, and in order to have some data before them
upon which to form a satisfactory opinion, requested Mr. Tite,
M.P., to move the House of Commons for a return from each vestry
and district board in the metropolis, of its population; number
of houses; extent of its area; aggregate
p. 5
length of its
streets; and the value of property, as assessed to live county
rate, and the poor rate.  The committee wished this return
also to show the number of meetings held during the year, whether
of the full board or of committees, or sub-committees; as well as
the names and salaries of the officers, with particulars of any
other benefits enjoyed by them: and that this information might
be tabularly arranged in the order of the amount of population of
each place.  See Appendix No. 6 (page 47).

Mr. Tite however replied that Sir John Shelley had moved for
such a return, referring to one similar to that printed at page
69 in the second report, but as the return moved for by Sir John
Shelley differed from that suggested by the committee, in several
important particulars, the vestry requested Mr. Tite to obtain
the introduction into it of the additional information.

The act for regulating the supply of gas to the metropolis
rendered it necessary that the vestry should consider the
appointment of a Gas Examiner; and having themselves determined
to put in operation in this parish the act for preventing the
adulteration of articles of food and drink by appointing an
Analyst; a committee was appointed in March, 1861, to confer with
Dr. Barclay as to his acceptance of the latter office, and the
terms upon which he would undertake its duties, having regard to
his diminished duties as medical officer of health.  This
Committee was amalgamated with one appointed subsequently, and
specially, to consider the duties and salary of the medical
officer of health, to whom was referred also, the question of the
appointment of the gas examiner.

In consequence of the heavy amount of the solicitors’
(Messrs. Lee and Pemberton) bill for the year 1859–60,
which included the greater part of the law charges in the actions
brought against the vestry by the London Gas Light Company and
Mr. Hornsby, the contractor, those gentlemen suggested in the
following letter to the vestry clerk that they should be
taxed:—

44, Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, W.C., London,

18th May, 1860.

Dear Sir, We have given the subject of our Mr.
Pemberton’s conversation with you respecting our bill of
costs, mature consideration, and feeling the delicate position in
which the vestry are placed as trustees accountable to their
constituents, we would suggest that for the future all our bills
be referred to Mr. Richard Dax, of the
p. 6
Temple, barrister at law, for
taxation, and to certify the amount properly payable to us.
This course is adopted by the Great Western and North Western
railway companies, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton
railway company, the Shrewsbury railway company, the Metropolitan
railway company now in course of formation, all of whom refer
their solicitors’ bills to Mr. Dax for the satisfaction of
the shareholders, and we believe it to be the practice with
nearly all railway and other large companies; should the vestry
resolve to do so, we shall feel great pleasure in submitting our
bills to Mr. Dax, and being bound by his certificate, as it is
extremely distasteful to us that any doubt should exist in the
minds of the vestry as to the propriety or amount of any item
charged by us, which however there almost necessarily must be,
from the technical manner in which solicitors are obliged to make
out their bills.  We ought to add, that we have no sort of
personal acquaintance with Mr. Dax, who is the son of the late
Master of the Exchequer, and a well known author and authority on
the subject of solicitors’ costs.  Should the vestry
adopt our suggestion, we must ask to be allowed to make out the
bills now before them, afresh, as they are not framed for
taxation, and that in future, our bills should be delivered
half-yearly and paid within a short time after they have been
certified, and we remain, dear Sir, your’s faithfully,

Lee &
Pemberton
.

The vestry, having accepted the proposal, returned the bills
to the solicitors as desired, and requested Mr. Finch, a
solicitor and a member of the vestry, to attend the
taxation.  This, after a strong protest from the solicitors,
he did; and the accounts amounting to £914. 3s. 5d., as
originally delivered, were settled by Mr. Dax at £998. 8s.
7d., including the costs of taxation.

The law costs for the present year have been submitted to the
same process, and have been certified by Mr. Dax to be correct at
the amount at which they were sent in,—viz., £177.
1s. 6d.

Mr. Miles having been elected to preside at eighty-three
meetings, out of the one hundred and fifty-three held during the
year, his services as chairman were again acknowledged by a vote
of thanks on the twenty-first of May.  The thanks
p. 7
of the vestry
have been also given during the year to Mr. Perry on the eighth
of May, for his exertions as delegate at the metropolitan and
county association for the equalization of the poor rates; and to
Mr. Foy on the fourth of December, for the tasteful way in which
the decorations of the vestry hall, on the occasion of the
inauguration dinner were carried out by him.

GENERAL WORKS.

Appendix No. 7 (pages 48–49), represents the cost,
during the past year under the several sub-heads of paving,
lighting, watering, cleansing, &c., and the provision made
for meeting the same, by orders upon the board of guardians.

The surveyor’s return upon this subject forms Appendix
No. 8 (page 50).

PAVING.

The cost of the item of paving during the past year, exceeding
the estimate by four hundred and fifty pounds, has been unusually
heavy,—viz., £3042 2s. 10d., after allowing for the
sum chargeable to the several public companies and others for
works executed for them.  This is about twelve hundred and
fifty pounds more than the cost of the same item of expenditure
in the year 1856–7, after making the same allowances;
upwards of four hundred pounds more than in 1857–8, eight
hundred pounds more than in 1858–9, and six hundred pounds
more than last year.  It has been occasioned mainly by the
purchase of the following materials, and by works executed in the
places hereinafter named:—

In the
last report it was stated that the question at issue between the
Chief Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Works, &c., and the
vestry, as to the taking charge and maintenance of the Chelsea
Bridge Road, was in an unsatisfactory state, and the position of
that question was stated in the appendix to the fourth report
(No. 9), at pages 45 to 52, up to the receipt of Mr.
Austin’s letter of the 27th June, 1860.  The
proceedings since that date will be found in the Appendix to this
report, No. 9 (pages 51 to 55).

LIGHTINGS

The Metropolis Gas Act received the royal assent on the 28th
August, 1860: it contains fifty-seven clauses, many of them most
important for the protection of public and private
consumers.  By the twenty-seventh section of the act (23
& 24 Vic., cap. 125) the vestry are required to provide
apparatus for testing the illuminating power and purity of the
gas, and to appoint a competent person as examiner; and by the
same section the gas companies are required to erect, at a
distance not less than one thousand yards from their works,
experimental meters with the necessary apparatus for testing the
illuminating power of the gas supplied.  In alleged
compliance with this requirement the London Gas light company
have appointed a testing station at the house No. 73, Besborough
Street, Pimlico.

Mr. Hughes
[8]
observes with reference to this
twenty-seventh section,—

“There was some discussion as to the
propriety of making the requirements of this clause compulsory
instead of merely permissive.  After the fullest
consideration however, it was thought essential, with the view of
avoiding discussions in vestries, and especially with the view of
counteracting the underhand and secret influence which the gas
companies exert in many vestries and district boards, to make the
clause compulsory.  There are many instances on record,
where powers are given to local authorities, and yet these
powers, although highly important to the public interests, have
never hitherto been exercised.  Hence an additional reason
for positively requiring them to provide apparatus, &c., for
testing the gas, and to appoint and pay an inspector for the
purpose.  It is true that no
p. 9
time is fixed within which the
apparatus is to be provided and the inspector appointed, but I
apprehend it will be competent for any ratepayer to compel, by
mandamus, the performance of this duty by any vestry or district
board, within a reasonable time.

“The second section of the clause imposes an obligation
on the gas companies—namely, that each of them shall within
six months erect at the prescribed distance from their works, an
experimental meter and other apparatus for testing the
illuminating power of the gas.

“Now these two obligations, the one on the local
authorities of the metropolis, and the other on the gas
companies, must not be confounded, because they are perfectly
distinct, and the one is not to be a substitute for the
other.  In the first place each local authority in the
metropolis—
i.e.
, each vestry and district board,
about thirty-eight in number, constituted under the Metropolis
Local Management Act, is to erect its own apparatus, and appoint
its own inspector; and from future clauses it appears that the
act contemplates a continuous and regular succession of testing
by this inspector, both for purity and illuminating power.
The evidence of this inspector however as to any defects in the
gas, will not be conclusive until his report has been confirmed
by testing the gas at the prescribed distance of 1000 yards from
the works.  Hence the necessity for the obligation on the
company.  The next clause will better explain the mode of
proceeding by the inspector, whenever he finds the gas to be
below the prescribed standard of illuminating power.  With
reference to purity there is nothing about testing for this at
the distance of 1000 yards, and therefore the test for this may
be made wherever the inspector pleases.

“With respect to the number of separate places for
testing the gas, inasmuch as there are thirteen companies
included within the act, and each must provide a testing house
1000 yards distant from their works, there must evidently be not
less than thirteen of these.
[9]
But if each
local authority
p.
10
also erects a separate one at some central part of its
district, thirty-eight of these will be necessary.  A power
is afterwards given for two or more local authorities to combine,
and then the number will probably be somewhat diminished.

“All this necessity for a duplicate set of testing
establishments is rendered essential by the absurd requirement of
the act as to testing the gas at 1000 yards distance from the
works.  Now as the erection of this apparatus by the
companies and the establishment of a permanent testing place away
from their works will be very expensive to the companies, it is
just possible they may be very glad to be relieved from this
expense, and may consent to the testing at the establishment of
the local authority being sufficient evidence of the illuminating
power as well as the purity of the gas.  This is the more
probable as it must be perfectly well known to the
companies—at least to their engineers—that so far as
the company is concerned the gas may just as well be tested in
the centre of any district supplied, as at the limited distance
of 1000 yards from the works.”

Under the provisions of the fiftieth section of this act, the
duty is imposed upon the Metropolitan Board of Works of raising
the costs and charges incident to its passing; and that board
have accordingly levied under their precepts upon the several
vestries and district boards, the necessary amounts for meeting
the claims received.

The accounts sent in by the various parties were submitted to
the proper officer of the House of Commons for taxation with the

The
proportion of the above with which this parish is debited by the
precept of 1861 is £106 16s. 5d., but that proportion is
based upon the amount of the accounts as sent in; as reduced by
taxation it will only be £81 12s. 8d.  But as the
vestry has already contributed two hundred pounds to Mr. Beal in
answer to his various appeals, and expended upwards of twenty
pounds in making experiments as suggested by him, they will have
a large sum to receive back

In November, 1860, a proposal was made by the vestry of St.
James’, Westminster, to recognize the services of Messrs.
Beal and Hughes throughout the enquiry into the supply of gas to
the metropolis, and the passing of the recent measure by raising
some fitting testimonial, and a committee of that vestry having
been appointed to carry it out, Messrs. Hall and Perry were
deputed to confer with them as to the best mode of doing so.

The Bill to amend the Metropolis Gas Act,
[11]
introduced by the government into
parliament for transferring to the metropolitan board of works,
so far as regards the metropolis, the powers conferred by the
acts for regulating measures used in the sale of gas (22 & 23
Vic., cap. 66, and 23 & 24 Vic., cap. 146) upon the justices
of the peace, of appointing inspectors of meters, having received
the royal assent (24 & 25 Vict., cap. 79), it will be the
duty of that board to take the necessary steps for carrying it
into execution.  To aid in accomplishing this transfer, the
vestry on the tenth July, 1860, expressed their opinion that the
appointment of inspectors of meters in the metropolis would be
best placed in the hands of the metropolitan board of works, and
petitioned parliament and memorialised the justices of the peace
upon the subject.  See Appendix No. 10 (page 56).

The number of public lamps in the parish on the 25th March,
1861, was as follows—

The contractors were fined £40 10s. for neglect during
the year.

IMPROVING.

The principal charges under this head are for works over the
Ranelagh sewer at Sloane Square in rebuilding the south wall; and
in fencing the enclosure opposite Royal Avenue Terrace.

REMOVING NUISANCES.

The removal of the dust, ashes and refuse from the houses of
the inhabitants, and the public courts and alleys during this
year has cost £311 2s.  An alteration in the form of
the contract as to the mode of executing the works by which the
parish is divided into daily districts, was made during this
year, which has very greatly lessened the public inconvenience,
and consequently the number of complaints.  See Appendix No.
11 (page 57).

SANITARY MEASURES.

The return of the proceedings taken by the vestry under the
metropolis local management act and the nuisances removal act, as
required by the former statute to be published, will be found in
the Appendix No. 12 (page 60).

Forty-seven slaughter houses in the parish were licensed by
the magistrates in October, 1860, not one having been opposed by
the vestry.  A list of them is given in the Appendix No. 13
(page 61).

The tenant of No. 3, Queen’s Road East, having been
detected in slaughtering upon his premises which were not
licensed for that purpose, the attention of the board was called
to the subject, but as it appeared that he had been acting under
the impression that the premises were licensed, in place of other
proceedings, a letter of warning was written to him, and the
offence was discontinued.

The notices of the vestry having been neglected by Mr.
p. 13
Peter
Augustus Halahan, owner of Nos. 1 to 10, Wickham Place,
application was made under the nuisances removal act to the
magistrate and his orders obtained for the execution of the
necessary works; these orders being also neglected and nothing
being done at the expiration of the time allowed, the clerk was
instructed to apply for the enforcement of the penalties provided
by the twenty-seventh section.  The defendant was fined
thirty-six shillings and costs, and in default of payment was
committed to prison.

A manuscript copy of all the reports made to the vestry by the
medical officer of health during the year is sent to the
metropolitan board of works with a copy of this report.

GENERAL RATES.

The orders issued by the vestry, and the rates made by the
overseers (the board of guardians) thereunder during the year,
have been as follows:—

SEWERAGE WORKS.

Again no general sewers rate for local purposes having been
made during the year, there is a deficit upon this account, of
one hundred and fifty-five pounds nineteen shillings and one
penny.

In the Appendix No. 14 (page 62), and No. 15 (page 63), will
be found statements giving particulars of a similar kind to those
given under the head of General Works.

APPLICATIONS.

During the period between the 26th March, 1860, and the 25th
March, 1861, the vestry have adjudicated upon forty-six
applications for directions upon the subject of house drainage,
twenty-three of which had reference to the drainage of
twenty-five houses already built, and twenty-three to forty-three
intended houses and the new barracks at Pimlico; they have also
brought under the cognisance of the Commissioners of Police, the
dangerous condition of forty-five buildings, and have decided
upon seventeen miscellaneous applications.  Of the
applications so made, fifty-nine have been granted, and four
negatived.

Eight buildings have been commenced without previous notice to
the vestry, and their builders having been summoned before the
board for neglect, the explanations given by them, or their
apologies, have in most cases been considered satisfactory.
Fourteen proposals have been made to build before the general
frontage line, and one hundred and three obstructions and
offences upon the public highway have been dealt with by the
Board.

VESTRY HALL.

The first meeting of the vestry in the new building took place
on the ninth of October, 1860, and shortly afterwards it was
determined to celebrate the public opening of the large hall with
an inauguration dinner.  A committee being formed for the
purpose the necessary arrangements were made, and
p. 15
on the
thirtieth of November one hundred and twenty of the most
influential parishioners, presided over by Viscount Chelsea, with
the county members as their guests, commemorated the completion
of a building, which it may be permitted the vestry to hope, will
be of service to the ratepayers and the parish.  The report
and balance sheet of the dinner committee is printed in the
Appendix No. 18 (pages 65–66).

After the dinner the first public use of the hall was given
gratuitously on three days to the Chelsea, Brompton, and Belgrave
Dispensary, and by means of an oratorio, “The
Creation,” on one day; a lecture by the Rev. J. B. Owen, of
St. Jude’s Church, on another; and a concert on a third
day, that useful local charity realised nearly one hundred
pounds.

Having obtained a license for public music and dancing, the
applications for the hire of the hall were soon found to be so
numerous that a committee was appointed to regulate the letting,
and they drew up the scale of charges which was approved by the
vestry, and will be found at page 67.  A debtor and creditor
account in connexion with the letting of the hall will be also
found at pages 68–69.

One of the most important applications referred to the letting
committee was from the proposed Literary and Scientific
Institution, that the suite of rooms on the east side of the
building might be set apart for their use.  The letting
committee made a special report upon the subject, to the vestry
on the eighteenth December, and a deputation from the council of
the institution, consisting of the Rev. F. Blunt, Messrs.
McCullagh, Lawrance and Mead, with Mr. Bull, the honorary
secretary, had an interview with the vestry.  The report
which is printed at page 70, read in connection with the
following resolution which was passed by the vestry, will explain
the nature of the engagement subsisting between the two
bodies:—“Resolved, that the suite of rooms upon the
ground floor (east side) including the lighting and warming of
the same, and the use of the Hall for forty nights during the
year, including the lighting, warming, and cleaning of the same,
be let to the council of the Institution for £50 per annum,
payable half-yearly, from Christmas next.  The tenancy to be
subject to six months’ notice of determination by either
party at any time.” A debtor and creditor account for one
winter quarter will be found at page 74.

Upon the application of the vestry, Sir R. Mayne, the
p. 16
chief
commissioner of police, appointed a standing for ten cabs at the
King’s Road end of Robert Street, exactly opposite the
hall; but unfortunately the post-office authorities were unable
to comply with their request that a pillar letter box might be
placed near to the hall.

The vestry hall buildings are insured in the Union Assurance
Office for six thousand pounds; and the fixtures, fittings, and
furniture, in the Manchester Fire Assurance Office for seven
hundred pounds.

Ten thousand pounds, the sum originally borrowed, not having
been sufficient to complete the building together with the
fitting and furnishing, an application was made to the
metropolitan board of works for their sanction to a further loan
of two thousand pounds; and as it was necessary to accompany that
application with a statement of the entire estimated cost, and to
fortify it with a memorial from the vestry, those documents, as
they contain much matter of interest, are printed at pages 75 and
72–73.

COUNTER’S CREEK DISTRICT.

Since the last report the sum assessed by the metropolitan
board of works upon this portion of the parish has been, for the
year 1861, four hundred and seventy-nine pounds, eleven shillings
and eleven pence; but the vestry have abstained from issuing
their order to the board of guardians for its collection.
They have, however, in consequence of the receipt of the
following letter, upon the recommendation of the Finance
Committee, paid the amount for 1858:—

Metropolitan Board of
Works,

1, Greek Street, Soho, W.,

17th October, 1860,

Dear Sir,—I am directed by the metropolitan board of
works to acquaint you that they have directed their attention to
the subject of the amounts outstanding on their precepts issued
to the vestries and district boards of the metropolis, and they
desire me to apprize you for the information of the vestry of
Chelsea, that having been unsuccessful in their attempt to carry
a measure through Parliament in the past session for conferring
upon the board the necessary powers to deal with the question of
the redistribution of the Counter’s Creek charges, they
have had under consideration the subject of the payment of the
amount due from the vestry on the precept for the ordinary
p. 17
expenses of
the board for the year 1858, being the sum of £447
4
s.
2
d.
payment of which was, as you will
recollect, allowed to stand over until the re-apportionments of
the debts of the Commissioners of Sewers had been discussed in
Parliament.  The board now feel that the time has arrived
when it is necessary that they should adopt measures for
obtaining payments of the amounts outstanding, and after an
attentive consideration of the facts of the case, and having
regard to the arrangement with the vestry in reference to the
parish contributing to the cost of the Counter’s Creek
diversion sewer, the conclusion they have arrived at as to the
most convenient course to be adopted is, that the board should
proceed to appoint persons to make a rate on the parish in
default, for the amount due on the precept, and in the event of
the vestry continuing their objection to the payment, that some
ratepayer should then raise the question of the liability of the
parish by an appeal against the rate, on which a special case
might be reserved for the opinion of the Court of Queen’s
Bench.  I am directed to add that the Board have deferred
further proceedings in the matter for a fortnight from the date
of their last meeting, the 12th instant, in order to afford the
vestry an opportunity of paying the amount in question should
they think proper so to do; and meanwhile I am to request that
you will be good enough to lay this letter before the vestry, and
to favor me with a reply with the least possible delay.  I
am, dear sir, yours faithfully,
John
Pollard
, Clerk of the Board.

The amount assessed for 1859, four hundred and fifty-six
pounds, nine shillings and one penny, was paid by order of the
board on the sixth December, 1859, before any portion of it was
received from the board of guardians.

January, 1861, the metropolitan board were very pressing for
payment of the amount for 1860 (five hundred and eighteen pounds,
nineteen shillings, and one penny), threatening immediate
proceedings if it were not made before the 25th of that month;
the vestry, however, appealed through Mr Tite against this undue
pressure, contrasting with it, the treatment received by the
vestry of Kensington, who were in arrear many, if not all, of
their instalments, and eventually
p. 18
the metropolitan board consented to
receive the amount of the precept for their ordinary expenses of
1860 less this sum which was included in it.  Thus it is
that the sums assessed for the first four years have been
collected in the district, and paid to the metropolitan board;
but for the two last, 1860 and 1861, they have not been paid to
the metropolitan board, nor have any steps been taken to collect
the money in the district.

METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS.

The estimate upon which the sums were originally proposed to
be raised by the metropolitan board of works for the services of
the year ending the thirty-first of December, 1860, gives the

This estimate, however, having been printed and sent to the
various vestries and district boards, underwent considerable
discussion and some modifications, the principal of which latter,
were, that instead of including the whole cost of the new
buildings in Spring Gardens in the precepts for 1860, it was
determined to spread it over three years; an item of
£20,000 for deodorization was reduced to £10,000; the
amount for special charges was reduced by £5,000; and the
sum of £2,000 was substituted for £5,000 for minor
improvements.  These alterations, with a credit of
£364 10s. 10d. (the remaining portion of the £3053
16s. 3d. adverted to in former reports), had the effect of
diminishing the amount required from this parish to £2239
10s. 9d., and it was thus apportioned by the precept dated 11th
May, 1860:—

has been required to provide for metropolitan purposes the large
sum of £7,747 14s. 1d.

The metropolitan board of works early in February of the
present year determined to re-introduce into parliament the bill
for amending the Metropolis Local Management Act, containing the
same provisions as were in the bill of last session, with the
exception of the introduction of certain clauses for the
re-apportionment of the Rock Loan; but in consequence of the
strong opposition to those clauses, the board deemed it expedient
to withdraw them from the bill, and to embody them in a separate
bill, and the two bills were accordingly introduced into the
House of Commons.  The first of them, after great delays,
passed through the House of Commons on the nineteenth of July,
1861, and was read a first time in the House of Lords on the
twenty-second of that month, but in consequence of the advanced
period of the session, it was found impossible to procure its
passage through the required stages in order to its becoming law
this year.  The bill No. 2, having relation to the Rock
Loan, being strongly opposed by certain members of the House of
Commons, was withdrawn.

p. 20
With
respect to the abortive bill of 1860, the solicitors of the
metropolitan board reported: “We think it will be nearly
correct to estimate the expense to the board, exclusive of
printing, &c. by the printers of the board, and expenses of
that kind, at about £1650.”  It is to be hoped
that the failure of 1861 will be somewhat less costly.

The vestry of Chelsea have at various times responded to the
invitation of the metropolitan board for suggestions during the
preparation of the several bills for amending the Metropolis
Local Management Act; for convenience of reference, their labours
in this respect will be found in the Appendix No. 19, (pages 77
to 103).

CHELSEA CHARITIES.

On the twenty-second of May, 1860, upon the motion of Mr.
Finch, a committee, consisting of the rector (the Rev. A. G. W.
Blunt), the churchwardens (Dr. Diplock and Mr. Collier), three
past churchwardens (Messrs. Hall, Perry, and Leete), and Messrs.
Whitehead, Jones, Miles, Brown, Rabbits, E. O. Symons, Till, and
Finch, was appointed to enquire into the charities of the parish,
the present particulars of the several properties, and the
application of the respective annual proceeds thereof, and to
report thereon.  At the same time, the vestry clerk reported
that, at the request of the rector, he was making arrangements
preliminary to the appointment of new trustees, and laid before
the vestry the following letter from Mr. Druce:

Mr. Lahee,

Dear Sir, Doubtless you are aware that the information
contained in last Saturday’s “Chelsea Times”
[20]
was provided by me, as far as concerned
the Chelsea charities.

The article of this morning
[20]
would lead me to
suppose that it was taken to be the opinion of the writer of such
information that under present circumstances it would be to the
advantage of the parish that the vestry clerk should be a
solicitor; nothing can be more foreign to my opinion, and without
compliment, I think the office is now in very good hands.
In the wicked old tory times on Easter Tuesday, a man might blow
out the steam of discontent, and tell a few truths profitable to
the parish to hear; now a few highly honourable and sensible
parishioners ‘make things pleasant’
p. 21
in a
comfortable room in a house in the King’s Road.  The
money of the parish charities is not properly looked after; for
many months I have been trying to get the late rector to put
matters to rights, but without avail.  Being therefore left
sole trustee for some portion, and knowing more than most, about
the parish school and trust funds, I thought I was the proper
person to light the match.  Should the vestry appoint the
committee on charity affairs, I shall be happy to attend their
summons to give them any information in my power: and I think
they ought to have a committee, both on this subject and that of
the church trustees, and at least chronicle the exact state of
facts; for, seriously speaking, we owe ‘liberal
opinions’ no small grudge for shutting up Easter
Tuesday.  I do not recollect that in your charity report
[21]
you mentioned the large sums belonging
to the charity schools, if you did, the vestry ought to have seen
that the trustees were dying out.  From my experience of the
working of the parish charities, schools, &c., I am quite
convinced that the vestry should annually qualify themselves to
issue a report on all charity money.  I have never found
anything to make me think otherwise than favourably of the
honesty of all dealings with the charity money, but I have found
abundant reason to rest satisfied, that without some lay
assistance and watchfulness, all matters get into disorder,
especially where there are any accounts to keep.  This
letter is at your service, and may be used as you think
fit.  I am, dear sir, always yours very faithfully,
Wm. Druce
.  Swan Wharf, Chelsea, 14th
April, 1860.

The committee, favoured occasionally with the assistance of
Mr. Druce, and strengthened by the addition to it of Messrs.
Butt, Tipper, and Callow, have met upon numerous occasions, and
are carefully pursuing their enquiry.

CREMORNE GARDENS.

It will be recollected that towards the close of the season of
1858, the vestry thought it necessary to remind Mr. Simpson, the
proprietor of Cremorne Gardens, of the arrangement made with them
as to the conduct of his
p. 22
gardens, particularly as to the hour
of closing; and that Mr. Simpson’s reply, although dated
the 16th of August, was not received in sufficient time to be
considered until the meeting on the fifth of October, when it was
thought to be unsatisfactory.  Last year the vestry again
moved in the matter, by reminding him of these promises, and
requesting to know before Monday, the tenth of September, whether
it was his intention to comply with their wishes and those of the
parish, by closing the gardens at twelve o’clock at
night.  No reply having been received from Mr. Simpson at
the meeting of the board on the eleventh of September, it was
moved by Mr. Delany that the report of the second of November,
1857, which the vestry had refrained from making public in
consequence of the pledge on the part of the proprietor, that the
gardens should be closed as near to midnight as possible, and
that in other respects he would meet the wishes of the vestry,
and the comfort of the inhabitants, should be printed for the use
of the vestry.  The chairman, however, having ruled that
this motion was irregular, it was referred to the committee of
works and for general purposes to consider the whole question,
particularly with reference to the effect, a change in the
proprietorship, from an individual to a company, might have in
increasing the annoyance of the parishioners; and the report of
the committee was presented on the twenty-fifth of September.

That report, which is printed at page 107, recommended the
publication of the report of 1857, and the presentation of a
petition to the licensing magistrates that the hour of closing
might be made twelve o’clock at night, as was the case with
other public gardens.  A memorial from forty-four owners of
property and ratepayers residing near the gardens, urging the
vestry to act, was presented at the same time the report was
under consideration.

The vestry then decided, by a majority of 17 to 6, to present
the petition, but to withold the publication of the report of
1857; and the solicitor being in attendance with a form of
petition, which was approved, the seal was affixed to it at once,
and it was duly presented.

On the ninth of October, however, a day or two before the
licensing day, a communication was received from the solicitors,
which induced the board, on a division, by a majority of
p. 23
twenty-eight
to eight, to pass the following resolution:—

Resolved, that having regard to the communication
now made by the solicitors, from which it appears that the
necessary evidence in support of the petition cannot be obtained
upon the present occasion, the solicitors be instructed not to
incur any further expense in the matter, on the understanding
that if the gardens should be kept open after twelve at night,
and the nuisance, annoyance, and injury to the parishioners
continue, this board, will in sufficient time next year consider
the necessary steps to be taken effectually to oppose the
application for the renewal of the license in 1861.

“THE LOTS.”

“The Lots,” a parcel of land so called lying on
the banks of the river
[23a]
in front of
Ashburnham House, comprises about four acres, and is the meadow
ground formerly allotted to Sir Arthur Gorges by the Lord of the
Manor, in lieu of his right of common.
[23b]
These are, and have been for
centuries, the Chelsea Lammas Lands, and have hitherto been
accustomed to be opened on the twelfth of August, being the first
day of the month according to the Old Style.  The graziers,
butchers, and others, with their cattle, used formerly to
assemble in the lane leading to “The Lots” on the eve
of Lammas, and when the clock had struck twelve they entered upon
the meadow.

From the report of a committee, printed at page 108, appointed
by the vestry in the year 1834 to investigate the state of these
town meadows, when it was necessary
vi et armis
to
reassert the invaded privileges of the inhabitants, it appears
that “‘The Lots’ are Lammas land, and have been
for ages appurtenant to the manor of Chelsea.  The Lord of
the Manor possesses the right of letting the land on lease for
the spring and autumn quarters, beginning with March and ending
in August; and the inhabitants at large enjoy the privilege of
turning in their cattle from August till February, being the
autumn and winter quarters.”  Railways, however, and
acts of parliament for smoothing down difficulties in their way,
have sprung up since those pastoral clays; and the
p. 24
Lord of the
Manor having sold his freehold to a railway company, the clerk
called the attention of the vestry, on the 8th of May, 1860, to
the following advertisement:—

West London Extension Railway
Company.—Notice is hereby given, that a Meeting of the
Householders, Inhabitants, and Land-owners of the Parish of St.
Luke, Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, and other persons
interested in the Lammas Lands called “The Lots,” in
the said Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, will be held at the house
of Mr. John Sparks Alexander situate in Cremorne Road, in the
said parish, and known by the name or sign of the
‘King’s Arms,’ on Wednesday, the 9th day of May
next, at Eleven o’clock in the forenoon, for the purpose of
appointing a Committee to treat with the Company for the
compensation to be paid by them for the extinction of the Lammas
and other Commonable Rights, in or over certain land called
‘The Lots’ in the said parish of St. Luke, Chelsea,
and which is required by the Company for the purposes of the
‘West London Extension Railway.  Act,
1859.’—Dated the 27th day of April, 1860.—
Edward Bellamy
, Secretary of the
Company.

A meeting took place consequently on the 9th of May, at which
the following resolution was passed:—

Resolved, that Messrs. William Hall (church
warden), John Perry, James Miles, George Wevell Richards, and
William Whitehead, being five of the persons entitled to Lammas
or other Commonable Rights over or in the piece of land called
‘The Lots Meadow,’ otherwise ‘Chelsea Lot
Mead,’ situate in the parish of Saint Luke, Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex, and containing by admeasurement three acres,
two roods, and thirty perches, or thereabouts, and marked or
referred to in the map or plan, and in the book of reference of
the West London Extension Railway, deposited with the Clerk of
the Peace for the said County of Middlesex, by the number 10 in
the said parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, shall be, and they are
accordingly, in pursuance of the provisions of the ‘Lands
Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,’ appointed to be a
Committee having all such powers as by the ‘Lands Clauses
Consolidation Act, 1845’ are conferred upon Committees of
like description, to treat with the West London Extension Railway
Company for the compensation to be paid for the extinction of
p. 25
all Lammas or
other Commonable Rights over or in the said piece of land.

The important question of the boundaries of the parish has
occupied considerable attention during the past year, and has
been the subject of a reference to a sub-committee of the
committee of works and for general purposes, who have still the
subject under consideration.

Various memorials and petitions have been presented during the
year, to which, as they sufficiently elucidate the subjects of
them, and are printed in the appendix (Nos. 23 to 27) no further
allusion need be made here.

The “Public Indicator” erected in Sloane Square by
permission of the board in May, 1860, was removed in the
fallowing March, in consequence of the failure of the proprietors
to light it at night, and to provide the promised clock.  It
is retained in the custody of the vestry, under a clause in the
agreement, as a lien for the expenses of its removal and making
good the paving.

Plans, books of reference, and parliamentary notices of the
“London, Buckinghamshire, and West Midland Railway”
(whose intended terminus was in the Pavilion grounds), and of
“The London Tramway and Dispatch Company,” were
deposited with the Vestry, but both of their bills were
unsuccessful.  Mr. Train also made an application to the
vestry for permission to lay down his tramways in Sloane Street
and the King’s Road, but its consideration has been
adjourned
sine die.

On the twenty-ninth of January, 1861, Mr. Finch laid before
the Board a copy of a “Bill to Transfer the Seats in
Parliament forfeited by the Borough of St. Albans to the proposed
Borough of Chelsea and Kensington,” which Viscount Enfield,
M.P. for Middlesex had given notice of his intention to introduce
in the House of Commons.  Immediately the Government
[25]
brought in their “Bill for the
Appropriation of the Seats Vacated by the Disfranchisement of the
Boroughs of Sudbury and Saint Albans,” which contained the
following clause: “The parishes of Chelsea and Kensington
in the county of Middlesex shall, for the purposes
p. 26
of this act,
together form a borough, to be called the borough of Chelsea, and
such borough shall, from and after the said first day of
November, 1861, return one member to serve in
parliament.”

An influential deputation from both parishes, accompanied by
the two county members, had an interview with Lord Palmerston on
the fifth of March, on the subject of the bill, and laid before
his lordship various statistical information (see appendix No.
29).  But on a division in the House of Commons on the tenth
of June, the clause was rejected by a majority of two hundred and
seventy-five to one hundred and seventy-two.  Mr. Tite thus
reported the circumstance to the board:—

42, Lowndes Square,

Tuesday Morning, 1 o’clock.

My dear Mr. Lahee,—I never was so taken by surprise as
by the division I have just left.  The Government Bill was
affirmed by two large majorities, but when we came to the Chelsea
question, to my astonishment we were beaten by one hundred and
three.  The house was excessively impatient, and would
hardly listen to anything; but it appeared to me Sir James
Graham, whom they would hear, said all that could be said on the
subject.  I was also astonished at some of those I saw
voting against us.  I will send you the division list as
soon as I get it.  The impression in the House
just
now
was that the bill would be withdrawn, so in happier times
we may have another chance.—Yours very truly,

William
Tite
.

P.S.—Rather sharp work for M.P.’s yesterday.
I was on a committee from 12 to 4, in the House from 5 to just
now; to-day we begin again at 12, I suppose until 2 o’clock
Wednesday morning.

By order of the Vestry,

CHARLES LAHEE,

Vestry Clerk

I beg to report that that part of the carriage road leading to
Chelsea New Bridge which is within the parish of St. Luke,
Chelsea, is in a very dirty state and full of ruts; it is very
dangerous, and quite unfit for public traffic.  This road
was formed by the Board of Works, and has not yet been taken
charge of by the parish of St. Luke.  There has been some
correspondence between the parish and the Board, but nothing
definite has been come to.

In reference to my report of the 4th instant, respecting the
state of the carriage road leading to the New Chelsea Bridge, I
omitted to state that a portion
p. 53
of the road, viz., from
Queen’s-road East to the Commercial-road, a distance of 374
yards, is without gas lamps, or light of any kind at night,
rendering it a very dangerous thoroughfare, and affording great
facility for depredations to be committed.  I also beg to
mention that Her Majesty, when in town, frequently passes along
this road on her way to the new park at Battersea.

Sir,—Your letters of the 5th ultimo, and 6th instant,
the former requesting that the portion of the road leading to
Chelsea Bridge, in this parish, may be immediately put into a
proper state of repair, and the latter transmitting a report of
the Police to the First Commissioner of Her Majesty’s
Works, &c., upon the same subject, having been referred by
the Vestry to their Committee of Works and for General Purposes,
have, together with the former correspondence, and proceedings in
this matter, received their careful consideration.

In addition to the above mentioned two letters, the Committee
also had before them a letter from Sir Richard Mayne, dated the
9th instant, enclosing a further report from Superintendent
Gibbs, omitted from his former report above alluded to.

The Committee having reported their annexed resolution, and
the Vestry having approved of the same, I am directed to request
that you will lay the same before the First Commissioner.

Resolved,—That the First Commissioner of Her
Majesty’s Works, &c., be informed that the Committee
agree with him as to the bad state of that portion of the road
leading to Chelsea Bridge, lying in this parish, which is
probably owing to the manner in which it was originally made up,
and to the works which have been lately executed there; and as
the First Commissioner is aware of the difference of opinion
which exists as to the legal obligations of his department on the
one hand, and of the Vestry of Chelsea on the other, with respect
to this portion of the road, he be again urged, as he was twelve
months ago, to concur with
p. 54
the Vestry in adopting some
inexpensive and expeditious mode of bringing the questions in
difference before a competent tribunal for final decision.

your letter of the 26th ultimo, containing a copy of a resolution
of the Vestry of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, respecting the
portion of the road leading to Chelsea Bridge, which is in that
parish, and I am to state that the Board must deny that the bad
state of the road is ‘owing to the manner in which it was
originally made up,’ that with regard to ‘the works
lately executed there,’ if, as the Board presume, the
Vestry allude to the formation of a sewer, those works were not
done by, or with the consent of this department; and that
although the Board are advised that the parish are liable to the
repair and maintenance of the road, and have no claim on the
Board in respect thereof, they are willing, with a view of
avoiding expense to both parties, to consider any proposition
which the Vestry may submit to them for having the matter settled

your letter of the 24th instant, transmitting copy of a
resolution of the Committee of Works and General Purposes of St.
Luke, Chelsea, approved by the Vestry in regard to the portion of
the Chelsea Bridge Road, in that parish, and I am to state that
this Board are advised by counsel that a mandamus against the
parochial authorities will be the proper course to be adopted to
compel the performance by the latter of the duties which the
legislature has imposed upon them with respect to the road in
question; but that if the parochial authorities think that the
matter in dispute can be more speedily and satisfactorily
settled, and at less expense by means of a special case, and will
be good enough to transmit to this Board the draft of such a
case, it shall receive immediate attention; the bad state of the
road makes it, however, not merely desirable but necessary, that
the opinion of a court of competent jurisdiction should be
obtained as soon as possible.

APPENDIX No. 10

LIGHTING.

To the Justices for the County
of Middlesex
.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea in the
County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

That an Act was passed in the Session of Parliament one
thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, intituled ‘An Act
for Regulating Measures used in the Sales of Gas.’

By that Act provision was made for securing to every consumer
of gas throughout the kingdom an accurate instrument of
measurement for the gas he had to pay for, which was most
grievously required by the community, and the means appointed for
applying the benefits of that Act to the very large body of gas
consumers in the county of Middlesex, is that the justices of the
county should appoint an inspector or inspectors, and determine
the number of copies of the model gasholders to be stamped at the
Exchequer Office for the use of such inspectors.

In the Session of one thousand eight hundred and sixty another
Act was passed, intituled ‘An Act to amend the Act for
Regulating Measures used in the Sales of Gas,’ whereby the
time for the previous Act to take effect, with respect to the
appointment of inspectors and some other matters, was extended,
and it was provided that the previous Act should not come into
operation in any county in England until the magistrates of such
county, in quarter sessions, should have resolved to bring such
county under the operation of the Act.

Your memorialists are informed that the magistrates or
justices of Middlesex have not only failed to take any steps
whatever towards giving the metropolis the benefit of correct
measurement of gas, but have absolutely refused to do so.

By the Amendment Act making the application of the law
optional in counties as contradistinguished from boroughs it was
only intended to relieve rural districts, where little or no gas
is consumed, from the expense of having inspectors in those
districts, but there is nothing in the Amendment Act to make it
optional in boroughs; and your memorialists do not call upon the
justices of Middlesex to enforce it in the rural districts, but
in the densely populated metropolitan boroughs, and some
parishes.

If the justices do nevertheless consider that the option of
bringing the Act into operation in the metropolitan boroughs
rests with them, the public necessity for it is so great that
they are bound in the conscientious discharge of their
magisterial duty to do all that is necessary for that
purpose.

Your memorialists therefore respectfully suggest and fervently
hope that your Worships will immediately proceed to carry into
effect the said Act within the boroughs of Marylebone, Finsbury,
Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Southwark, and City of Westminster, and
parishes not included in any parliamentary borough, such as St.
Luke, Chelsea, Hammersmith, and Kensington.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 21st day
of May, 1861,

Chas.
Lahee

THE VESTRY HALL.

REPORT OF THE DINNER COMMITTEE.

Vestry Hall, January 15th, 1861.

To the Vestry of the Parish of
Chelsea
.

Gentlemen,—We, the subscribers hereto, members of your
committee appointed to carry out the arrangements for giving
proper effect to your resolution of the 23rd October last, to
inaugurate the opening of this hall with a public dinner, have
the pleasure to present the following brief account of our
stewardship.

As so many of you were present upon the occasion, it is almost
superfluous to say more than that it was attended by one hundred
and twenty persons, many of them the most influential in the
parish, and that it passed off, we hope and believe, to the
general satisfaction of the guests.

We annex a financial statement for your information, from
which it appears that the receipts from the sale of tickets were
£113 8s., and the cost of the dinner and wines £113
12s., the two amounts as nearly as possible balancing each
other.

The incidental expenses, for music, printing, toastmaster, a
supper for the workmen, &c., amounted to £26 10s. 9d.,
which by the kind feeling of Mr. Pitt, of Cheyne-walk, has been
reduced to the balance of £21 14s. 9d., a sum which we now
ask at your hands.

Respectfully submitted,

Jas.

REPORT
OF THE LETTING COMMITTEE RESPECTING THE CHELSEA LITERARY AND
SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION.

Committee Room, Vestry Hall,

18th, December; 1860.

To the Vestry of the Parish of
Chelsea
.

Gentlemen
,—

We the undersigned of your Committee, for Letting, &c.,
the Hall, beg to present this further Report with respect to the
application of the Honorary Secretaries of the proposed Literary
and Scientific Institution, which you referred to us from the
Committee of Works and for General Purposes, on the 16th October
(1).

On the 20th of October Mr. Bull attended us and explained his
views, and followed up that interview with a letter, which was
before us on the 19th November, in which, on behalf of the
Council, he thanked the Vestry for the liberal manner in which
they received the application for setting apart a suite of rooms,
with the use of the Hall, for the purposes of the intended
Institution.  The letter proceeded:—

The Council sincerely rejoice in the view taken by
the Vestry of the utility and benefit of such an institution to
the whole body of ratepayers, and whilst they would desire to fix
their home in the new Vestry Hall as a central point for their
members, they do not for one moment expect that any of the
necessary expenses incidental to the use and occupation of the
rooms and hall should fall upon the ratepayers, but the Council
will most readily be prepared to pay every such charge arising
from the lighting, warming, or cleansing of the same.

The Council are anxious to make the Institution a credit and a
benefit to the whole body of parishioners, and by fixing a low
rate of subscription, to enable every person, however humble his
position, to become a member, should he have the inclination to
avail himself of its privileges.  The rate of subscription
to a large proportion of the members would not exceed 3d. per
week, the highest being one guinea per annum.

In reply we informed Mr. Bull “that we were of opinion
that £30 per annum (being the interest upon £1000)
would be a fair sum, alike equitable to the members of the
Institution and the ratepayers, to be paid as rent for the suite
of rooms and the use of the hall one evening in the week, the
Institution themselves bearing the incidental expenses of
lighting, warming, and cleansing the same, as stated in his
note.  That if the council agree to those terms, and will
make a proposal to that effect, we would lay it before the Vestry
for their approval.”

The Council then addressed to us the following letter, to
which we have given the most attentive consideration:—

“19, Walpole
Street, Chelsea,

December 3, 1860.

To the Committee of the New Vestry Hall,
Chelsea,—Gentlemen,—We beg to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 21st instant, and to thank you for allowing
our Council the use of your room for their weekly meetings.

The Council have taken into consideration the proposal of the
Vestry Committee for letting them the suite of rooms and use of
the hall for £30 per annum, as a rent for the same, besides
paying all expenses incurred for cleansing, warming, and
lighting.

p. 71
The
Council are apprehensive that this proposal may prove a stumbling
block to their future progress!

The object of the promoters of the Institution was, to
establish a Literary and Scientific Society so comprehensive in
its objects, and at the same time so accessible to all classes,
that it might possess almost all the advantages of a free
library, without its inconveniences.

To accomplish this desirable end, the Council fixed a low rate
of subscription, so that the industrious mechanic might share the
advantages of the Institution, in common with all the other
classes of the inhabitants.

In order however to meet the views of the Vestry Committee, so
far as the faithful carrying out of the above purpose will
permit, and also to expedite the arrangement between the Vestry
and the Council, the following resolution was agreed to at a
special meeting of the Council on Thursday evening last, the Rev.
Frederick Blunt in the chair:—

“Resolved,—That in answer to the letter of the
Vestry Committee of the 21st instant, the following proposal be
submitted in lieu of that contained their letter:—

“‘That the sum of £40 per annum be offered
to the Vestry Committee as the utmost that the Council can give
consistently with the avowed objects of the Institution, this sum
to include the use and occupation of the three rooms, with
conveniences, on the ground floor of the building, and use of the
large hall once a week, together with all expenses incurred for
lighting and warming, the Council taking upon themselves to keep
in order the three rooms, leaving the cleansing of the large hall
in the hands of the Vestry.’

“The Council trust that the Vestry will take an enlarged
and liberal view of this proposition; and whilst the stated rent
of £30 per annum would be of infinitesimal value to the
ratepayers, this sum, in addition to the other charges, would
prove a heavy burden on the funds of the Institution, if it did
not altogether put an end to its future proceedings.—We
are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, Thos. Bull, Markham R.
Evans, Hon. Secs.”

We find that the cost of lighting, warming, and cleansing the
hall and anterooms, and of warming and lighting the suite of
rooms, will reach, on a moderate estimate, £38 19s. (say
£40) per annum, and we continue of opinion that if the
Vestry undertake these expenses, the Institution should pay in
addition, for the reasons above stated, £30 per annum as
rent.

We understand that an influential deputation will attend you
this day upon the subject.  We therefore, as the application
is for the permanent occupation of a portion of these premises,
leave the ultimate decision of the question respectfully in your
hands.

Respectfully submitted,

Blazdell

Memorial

re

additional Loan of
£2000.

To the Honorable the Chairman and Members of the
Metropolitan Board of Works
.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex.

Sheweth
,

That the Parish of Chelsea is very extensive and populous.

That it comprises about 9000 houses, is nearly 800 acres in
extent, and contains a population of about 70,000 persons.

That the matters of public concern to so large a number of
inhabitants are necessarily very numerous and weighty.

That by the 92nd section of the Metropolis Local Management
Act, your memorialists are authorized to defray expenses, as well
for paving, lighting, watering, cleansing, or improving the
parish, as for those public concerns; by the 150th section they
are enabled to erect a building for parish purposes; and by the
183rd section they are permitted, with the sanction of your
Honourable Board, to borrow any sums of money necessary for
defraying such expenses.

That with reference to the purposes for which a building so
erected may be used, Mr. Toulmin Smith is of opinion that
“under these words, (public concerns of any parish, or of
the inhabitants thereof) it will become matter of obligation on
the Vestry in the case of a single parish, and on the District
Board in the case of parishes combined in a district, to provide
for the expenses of public meetings, and those other similar
matters touching ‘public concerns’ which are now done
irregularly and illegimately. * * * The words in the section are
imperative,—these expenses ‘shall be defrayed
accordingly.’”  Again, “the most
economical course will always be to make such a building a part
of the erection for the offices, &c., of the board, as has
already been done in the case of St. Pancras Vestry Hall, and in
some other cases in the Metropolis.”

That acting within the discretion thus vested in them your
memoralists have erected a Vestry Hall, which is suitable in
every respect for the purposes of your memorialists, and for the
before-mentioned public concerns of the inhabitants.

That as evidence that the large room was much required in this
parish, and is fully appreciated by the inhabitants, your
memorialists do state that since its opening on the 30th November
last, seventy meetings of various kinds have taken place therein,
which may be thus classified:—Religious and Moral,
twenty-seven; Intellectual, twenty; Social, Political, and to
encourage the Volunteer movement, twenty-three.

That for nineteen of these meetings the use of the room has
been given absolutely without charge, and for the others a scale
of payment has been arranged by your Memorialists, which is in
their opinion equitable and fair—and which has been
submitted to your Finance Committee.

That the building erected by your Memorialists is plain and
substantial in its character; the plan of it having been
submitted to, and approved by, your Honourable Board before it
was commenced, (which original plan has not been departed from in
any substantial particular) and will cost (excluding the cost of
the site) the, not unreasonable, sum of Seven Thousand pounds;
being the original contract sum of £5630, and the remainder
for extra and additional works, which your Memorialists fear are
inevitable in all such undertakings.

p. 76
That
particulars in full detail of the estimated cost of the site,
building, fittings, furniture and sundries, have been laid before
your Finance Committee, by your Memorialists, amounting in the
whole to about, £12,000.

That your Memorialists are of opinion that the most equitable
manner of defraying the said expenses both for the present and
future Ratepayers is by means of a loan, repayable with interest
in twenty years, thus rendering the sanction of your Honorable
Board requisite.

That the Large Hall is intended to be used for purposes of the
Vestry, and in fact is now about to be so used for the election
of Vestrymen under the Act.

That although a portion of the premises is now temporarily
made use of as Reading Rooms, as stated in the letter of your
Memorialists to your Finance Committee, those rooms will most
probably be required for the Gas Examiner under the Metropolis
Gas Act, and the analyst under the Act for the Prevention of the
Adulteration of Food and Drink of last session.

That your Memorialists under the 150th Section of the
Metropolis Local Management Act deem the whole of the buildings
necessary and expedient, and under the 92nd section such
buildings are fully authorized inasmuch as they are clearly used
for the public concerns of their Parish and the inhabitants
thereof.

That no further or additional rate, than was contemplated at
the time the original loan of £10,000, was sanctioned by
your Honorable Board, will be required.

That the following objects may be mentioned as showing the
necessity of the Vestry Hall:—A place of meeting for the
local magistrates in petty sessions; a place for the public
discussion of important local public questions, as the Embankment
of the River at Chelsea, the Enfranchisement of the District, the
Removal of the Asylum Wall in the King’s Road, and the
Equalization of the Poor Rates.

That with reference to the remarks of your Finance Committee
in their report that their inquiries have satisfied them that the
building has not been erected exclusively for the purposes of the
Vestry, but for other objects not contemplated by the Metropolis
Local Management Act, your Memorialists submit that under the Act
referred to, it is not imperatively necessary that buildings of
this description should be erected exclusively for the purposes
of the Vestry; and that the building erected by your memorialists
has not been erected for any object not contemplated by the said
Act.

Your Memorialists therefore pray that, as they, and the
inhabitants of the Parish represented by them, are of opinion
that the expenses of the said Vestry Hall, &c., are in
relation to the regulation, government, or public concerns of
this Parish, and of the inhabitants thereof, and that the sum of
£12,000 is necessary for defraying such expenses; and that
such expenses will be best defrayed by a loan upon the credit of
the rates, your Honorable Board will not deem it expedient to
refuse your sanction to the additional loan of £2,000
already applied for.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 10th day
of May, 1861

25th March, 1858.

Sir,—In connexion with the subjoined letter, I have been
directed to transmit for your consideration as a member of the
Committee of Works and for General Purposes, certain general
heads for amendment.  Of the meeting for the discussion of
the same, and of any others which may appear to you desirable,
you will be specially advised.

I have the honor to be, Sir,

Your obedient servant,

Charles Lahee
,

Vestry Clerk.

Metropolitan Board of Works,

1, Greek Street, Soho, 9th January, 1858.

Dear Sir,—I beg to apprise you, for the information of
the Vestry of Chelsea, that the Metropolitan Board of Works are
now engaged in considering what amendments it may be expedient to

present session of parliament, and will be prepared to receive
from the Vestry any suggestions they may desire to offer in
reference to those provisions of the Act which relate to the
duties and powers of vestries and district boards.  If the
Vestry should deem it proper to offer any suggestions, and you
will be good enough, at your early convenience, to transmit to me
the draft of any amended clause or clauses which may be proposed,
I will immediately bring the subject under the notice of this
Board.

I am, dear Sir,

Yours very faithfully,

E. H. Woolrych
,

Clerk of the Board.

Clauses in Act
18 & 19
Vict. cap. 120.

General Heads for
Amendment
.

XI.  For every parish mentioned in either of the
Schedules (A) and (B) to this Act there shall be elected such
number as hereinafter mentioned
of the ratepayers
of the
parish who have signified in writing their assent to serve to be
auditors of accounts, which auditors shall be so elected at the
same times and in the same manner as members of the vestry; and
the number of ratepayers so to be elected auditors in any parish
not divided into
p.
78
wards under this Act shall be five, and the number of
ratepayers so to be elected auditors in any parish which is
divided into wards shall be the same as the number of wards, one
auditor being elected in each ward: Provided always, that where
the number of wards into which any parish is divided exceeds
five, the vestry of such parish shall at their first meeting
after the election of auditors as aforesaid, in any year, elect
by ballot from among such auditors five of them, and the five
persons so elected by ballot shall be the auditors for such
parish exclusively of any other person or persons who may have
been elected an auditor or auditors for such parish under the
provisions herein contained; and a list of the five persons so
elected by the vestry shall be forthwith published by the
churchwardens in the parish as herein provided: Provided also,
that no person shall be eligible to fill the office of auditor of
accounts who is not qualified to fill the office of Vestryman for
the parish; but no person shall be eligible to fill the office of
auditor who is a member of the vestry; and if any person be
chosen to be both a member of the vestry and auditor of accounts,
he shall be incapable of acting as a vestryman.

The system of accounts being necessarily intricate
,

and the scope of the powers of the Vestry to incur legal debts
inaccurately defined
,
the duties of the auditors are very
responsible
.

To consider whether a system of paid auditors
,
not
being of necessity ratepayers
,
such as that in practice
under the Poor Laws
,
is desirable
,
with the
necessary powers for enforcing their disallowances
.

XII.  The auditors first elected under this Act in
any parish as aforesaid shall go out of office at the time
appointed for the election of vestrymen and auditors in the year
one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven, and
the auditors
then elected and to be thereafter elected shall go out of office
at the election of vestrymen and auditors in the year next
following their election
.

There appears to be no reason why the annual election
might not be fixed for the
1
st of May
(sec. 7);
the
audit cannot commence until the
1
st of May
(sec. 195),

it may therefore happen that the auditors go out of office
before they can commence their audit
.

XVI.  On the day of election of vestrymen and
auditors in any parish under this Act the parishioners then rated
to the relief of the poor in the parish, or, where the parish is
divided into wards under this Act, in the ward thereof for which
the election is holden, and who are desirous of voting, shall
meet at the place appointed for such election, and shall then and
there nominate two ratepayers of the parish, or (if the parish be
divided into wards) of the ward for which the election is holden,
as fit and proper persons to be inspectors of votes; and the
churchwardens, or, in the case of a ward election, such one of
the churchwardens as is present thereat, or, where one of the
churchwardens is not present, the person appointed by them to
preside thereat, shall, immediately after such nomination as
aforesaid by the parishioners, nominate two other such
p. 79
ratepayers to
be such inspectors; and after such nominations the said
parishioners shall elect such persons duly qualified as may be
there proposed for the offices of vestrymen and auditors or
auditor:
and the chairman at such meeting shall declare the
names of the parishioners who have been elected by a majority of
votes at such meeting
: Provided nevertheless, that no person
shall be entitled to join or vote in any such election for any
parish, or any ward of any parish, or be deemed a ratepayer
thereof, or be entitled to do any act as such under this Act,
unless he have been rated in such parish to the relief of the
poor for one year next before the election, and have paid all
parochial rates, taxes, and assessments due from him at the time
of so voting or acting, except such as have been made or become
due within six months immediately preceding such voting or
acting.

How are the churchwardens to know officially from the
chairman of the ward meetings who are elected
?
and
,

in the case of persons elected to supply vacancies caused
otherwise than by effluxion of time
, (sec. 9),
in whose
places
?

Where there is a poll
,
the inspectors certify to the
chairmen
, (sec. 22,)
and the chairmen should be required
to certify under their hands to the churchwardens
,
in a
similar way
.
Where there is no poll
,
they
should certify in accordance with their declaration
.

XXII.
The inspectors shall
, immediately after
they have decided upon whom the aforesaid elections have fallen,

deliver to
the churchwardens, or to one of them, or other,

the person presiding at the election
, a list of the
persons chosen by the parishioners to act as vestrymen and
auditors or an auditor of accounts;
and the said list
,

or a copy thereof
,
shall be published in the parish as
herein provided
.

By whom should this list be prepared and published
?
(see sec. 26).
If by the churchwardens an official copy
should be sent to the vestry
.

XXX.
At every meeting
of any vestry under
this Act, in the absence of the persons authorised by law or
custom to take the chair,
the members present shall elect a
chairman for the occasion
before proceeding to other
business, and the chairman, in case of an equality of votes on
any question, shall have a second or casting vote.

To consider whether a permanent chairman is
desirable
.

LV.  Any member of the Metropolitan Board of Works,
or of any vestry elected for any parish mentioned in Schedule (A)
or (B) to this Act, or of the Board of Works for any district,
may at any time resign his office, such resignation of any member
of the Metropolitan Board of Works to be notified in writing
signed by such member to chairman of such board,
and such
resignation of any vestryman
or member of any such district
board
to be notified in writing signed by such vestryman

or member
to the churchwardens of the parish for which he was
elected
.

How is the fact of such resignation to become
officially known to the vestry
?
either a notice of such
resignation should be sent by the churchwardens to the clerk of
the vestry
,
or the resignation should be sent to him in
addition to the churchwardens
.

LXIX.  The vestry of every parish mentioned in
Schedule (A) to this Act, and the Board of Works for every
district mentioned in Schedule (B) to this Act, shall (subject to
the powers by this Act vested in the Metropolitan
p. 80
Board of
Works) from time to time repair and maintain the sewers under
this Act vested in them, or such of them as shall not be
discontinued, closed up, or destroyed under the powers herein
contained, and shall cause to be made, repaired, and maintained
such sewers and works, or such diversions or alterations of
sewers and works
as may be necessary
for effectually
draining their parish or district.

Instead of the words
“
as may be
necessary
,”
to employ the terms made use of in
sec.
135, “
as they may from time to time think
necessary
.”

LXXX.  Where any sewer in any of the parishes
mentioned in either of the Schedules (A) and (B) to this Act,
into which any drain shall be made or branched, has been built
since the third day of
September
, one thousand eight
hundred and thirteen, and before the commencement of this Act, at
the expense of any person or body other than any commissioners of
sewers,
the vestry
or district board
in whom such sewer
is vested
may order such sum as they may deem just to be paid
and contributed by the owner of the house to which such drain
belongs towards the expense of the construction of such sewer,
which sum shall, on the receipt thereof by such vestry or board,
be paid over to the person or body aforesaid, and such vestry or
board may, if they see fit, order and accept payment of such sum,
with interest after a rate not exceeding five pounds for the
hundred by the year, by instalments, within any period not
exceeding twenty years.

This section would appear not to reach those sewers in
Schedule D
,
which are vested in the Metropolitan Board of
Works
,
and have been built by private persons
,

under the circumstances particularised therein
.

If equitable in the one case
,
it would appear to be
so in the other
.

CV.  In case the owners of the houses forming the
greater part of any
new street
laid out or made, or
hereafter to be laid out or made, which is not paved to the
satisfaction of the vestry or district board of the parish or
district in which such street is situate, be desirous of having
the same paved, as hereinafter mentioned, or if such vestry or
board deem it necessary or expedient that the same should be so
paved, then and in either of such cases such vestry or board
shall well and sufficiently pave the same, either throughout the
whole breadth of the carriage way and footpaths thereof, or any
part of such breadth, and from time to time keep such pavement in
good and sufficient repair; and the owners of the houses forming
such street shall, on demand, pay to such vestry or board the
amount of the estimated expenses of providing and laying such
pavement, (such amount to be determined by the surveyor for the
time being of the vestry or board;) and in case such estimated
expenses exceed the actual expenses of such paving, then the
difference between
p.
81
such estimated expenses and such actual expenses shall
be repaid by the said vestry or board to the owners of houses by
whom the said sum of money has been paid; and in case the said
estimated expenses be less than the actual expenses of such
paving, then the owners of the said houses shall, on demand, pay
to the said vestry or board such further sum of money as,
together with the sum already paid, amounts to such actual
expenses.

CVI.  The vestry or district board of any parish or
district may, if they think fit, by notice in writing put up in
any part of any street in their parish or district, not being a
highway, declare their intention of repairing the same under this
Act, and thereupon the same shall be from time to time repaired
by them under the authority of this Act: Provided always, that no
street shall be repaired as last aforesaid unless such notice in
writing be also given to all persons interested in such street,
or if within one month after notice in writing has been put up or
given as last aforesaid any person interested in such street, or
the person representing or entitled to represent any person
interested as aforesaid, by notice in writing to the vestry or
board object thereto.

CVIII.  It shall be lawful for every vestry and district
board from time to time to place any posts, fences, and rails on
the sides of any footways or carriageways in their parish or
district, for the purposes of safety, and to prevent any carriage
or cattle from going on the same, and also to place any posts or
other erections in any carriage-way so as to make the crossings
thereof less dangerous for foot passengers, and also from time to
time to repair and renew any such posts, rails or fences, or to
remove the same, or any other obstruction or encroachment on any
carriageway or footway.

It has been held
(
and the decision upon appeal
was not reversed
)
that the words
“
new
street
,” (section 105),
mean a street formed since
the commencement of this Act
:
the effect of this decision
will be to leave in an unsatisfactory
,
perhaps a dangerous
state
,
many streets used by the public
,
but which
have not been formally taken in charge by the various parishes in
which they are situated
.

Perhaps a power to vestries and district boards to close up
as thoroughfares such streets might be advisable
.

CXIX.  If any porch, shed, projecting window, step,
cellar door or window, or steps leading into any cellar or
otherwise, lamp, lamp post, lamp iron, sign, sign post, sign
iron, snowboard, window shutter, wall, gate, fence, or opening,
or any other projection or obstruction placed or made against or
in front of any house or building after the commencement of this
Act, shall be an annoyance, in consequence of the same projecting
into or being made in or endangering or rendering less commodious
the passage along any street in their parish or district, it
shall be lawful for the vestry or district board to give notice

p. 82
in writing
to the owner or occupier of such house or building to remove such
projection or obstruction, or to alter the same, in such manner
as the vestry or board think fit, &c.

To consider the propriety of introducing the words
,
“
projecting blind
,
blind frame
,
or part
thereof
.”

CXXX.  Every vestry and district board shall cause
the several
streets
within their parish or district to be
well and sufficiently lighted, and for that purpose shall
maintain, or set up and maintain, a sufficient number of lamps in
every such street, and shall cause the same to be lighted with
gas or otherwise, and to continue lighted at and during such
times as such vestry or board may think fit, necessary, or
proper; and public lamps, and the lamp posts and lamp irons and
fittings thereof, to be provided by any vestry or district board,
shall vest in such vestry or board.

Section
250
gives the following as the meaning
of the word
“
street
”
any or part of any
highway
,
road
,
bridge
,
lane
,

footway
,
square
,
court
,
alley
,

passage
,
whether a thoroughfare or not
.

There should be some limit to the obligation to
light
.

CCII.  The Metropolitan Board of Works and every
district board and vestry respectively may from time to time
make, alter and repeal bye laws for all or any of the purposes
following; (that is to say), for regulating the business and
proceedings at their meetings and of committees appointed by
them, the appointment and removal of their officers and servants,
and the duties, conduct, and remuneration of such officers and
servants;
and the said Metropolitan Board may also from time
to time make
,
alter
,
and repeal bye laws for
regulating the plans
,
level
,
width
,
surface
inclination
,
and the material of the pavement and roadway
of new streets and roads
,
and the plans and level of sites
for building
,
and for regulating the dimensions
,

form
,
and mode of construction
,
and the
keeping
,
cleansing
,
and repairing of the pipes
,

drains
,
and other means of communicating with
sewers
,
and the traps and apparatus connected
therewith
;
for the emptying
,
cleansing
,

closing and filling up of cesspools and privies
;
and
for other works of cleansing
,
and of removing and
disposing of refuse
,
and for regulating the form of appeal
and mode of proceeding thereon
;
and generally for carrying
into effect the purposes of this Act
: and every such board
and vestry may thereby impose such reasonable penalties as they
think fit, not exceeding forty shillings, for each breach of such
bye laws, and in case of a continuing offence a further penalty
not exceeding twenty shillings for each day after notice of the
offence from the board or vestry: Provided always, that under
every such bye law it shall be lawful for the justices before
whom any penalty imposed thereby is sought to be recovered to
order
p. 83
the
whole or part only of such penalty to be paid, or to remit the
whole penalty: Penalty: Provided also, that no bye laws shall be
repugnant to the laws of
England
or to the provisions of
this Act; and that no bye law shall be of any force or effect
unless and until the same be submitted to and confirmed at a
subsequent meeting of the board or vestry: Provided also, that no
penalty shall be imposed by any such bye law unless the same be
approved by one of Her Majesty’s principal Secretaries of
State.

The attention of the Metropolitan Board has been drawn
to their powers under this section
,
and they have passed
the following resolution upon the subject
,
in that

“
it is not practicable for this Board to lay down any
uniform body of regulations for regulating the plans and levels
of sites for buildings and for the construction of house
drainage
,
properly adapted to the peculiar circumstances
of each district
;
and that the Vestry of Chelsea be so
informed.
”

No doubt uniformity is desirable
;
but regulation of
some kind
,
for the guidance of the officers
,
is
necessary
.

The power of making such bye laws should lie in the body
for whom its exercise is practicable
.

CCL.  The word “drain” shall mean and
include any drain of and used for the drainage of one building
only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for
the purpose of communicating with a cesspool or other like
receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage
of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different
persons is conveyed,
and shall also include any drain for
draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation
under the order of any vestry or district board
.

To consider whether the word “drain” should
be made to include any drain
,
for draining any group or
block of houses
,
by a combined operation
,
under the
authority of any former Commissioners of Sewers
.

The provisions of the 83rd, 121st, 122nd, and 123rd sections
of this Act, to be made to extend to the person causing the
offences to be committed.

In section 109, gas companies to be prevented from taking up
mains of pipes except for the purpose of substituting new pipes

In section 119, to introduce the words, “projecting
blind, blind iron, blind frame, reflecting shop lamps, gas

p. 84
That an
independent paid auditor or auditors should be appointed to audit
the accounts of all the vestries and district boards throughout
the metropolis, as well as of the Metropolitan Board of
Works.  That power should be given to vestries and district
boards, to put streets, which have never been properly formed,
into a proper state of repair, and to rate the owners and
occupiers of the property abutting on such streets for the
expense of putting the same into a proper state of repair, the
future maintenance thereof to devolve upon the vestry or
board.

That power should be given to compel the owners or occupiers
of property abutting on streets, to erect such fences as may be
necessary for the protection of the public.

2.—OBSERVATIONS UPON THE BILL PREPARED AND FORWARDED BY
THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS, on the 29th MAY, 1858.

It must be recollected that this Bill was not proceeded
with

Clauses in
Bill
.

Observations
.

III.  The inspectors of votes directed to be
appointed under the first recited Act, shall, before commencing
the duties of their office under the said Act, appoint by writing
under their hands an umpire; and in case of any dispute or
disagreement between the said inspectors, as to any matter which
they are by the said Act required to determine, such matter shall
be decided by the said umpire, and his decision in relation
thereto shall be final and conclusive.

The committee consider that in case of division amongst
the inspectors
,
the umpire should be chosen by
lot
.

V.  Any vestryman who during six successive months
shall not have attended the meetings of the vestry of which he is
a member, shall, upon the expiration of such six months, cease to
be a member of such vestry, and the vacancy occasioned by his so
ceasing to be a member, shall be filled up at the next annual
election.

The committee would have preferred three months as the
limit
;
but that attendance at any committee should
count
.
They think also that leave of absence might
be given in certain cases
.

XVII.  In case any sewer shall be constructed by any
vestry or district board in a street in which no sewer existed
previously to such construction, and in and on which no sewers
rate had been levied previously to 1st January, 1856, the expense
of constructing such sewer, including the cost of gullies, side
entrances, and other incidental charges and expenses, shall be
borne and defrayed by the owners of the houses situate in such
street, and of the land bounding or abutting on such street
respectively, in proportion to the length of frontage of the
houses or land belonging to them or any of them, and such
expenses shall be apportioned by the vestry or
p. 85
district
board, and the amount charged upon or in respect of each house or
premises shall be paid by instalments within such period as the
vestry or district board shall determine, not exceeding seven
years, and shall be recoverable from the present or any future
owner of the said house or premises in manner hereinafter
provided.

Suppose a street cut through market garden ground
,

upon which a small sewers rate has been paid
,
are the
houses and land to be free from payment under this
section
.

XXI.  The 77th section of the said Act is hereby
repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that no person shall
make or branch any sewer or dram, or make any opening into any
sewer vested in the Metropolitan Board of Works, or in any vestry
or district board, without the previous consent in writing of
such board or vestry: provided that it shall be lawful for any
person, with such consent, at his own expense, to make or branch
any drain into any sewer vested in any such board or vestry, or
authorized to be made by them, or either of them, under the first
recited Act, or this Act, such drain being of such size and
conditions, and branched into such sewer in such manner and form
of communication, in all respects as the board or vestry shall
direct or appoint; and in case any person, without such consent,
make or branch any sewer or drain, or make any opening into any
of the sewers vested in any board or vestry, or authorized to be
made by them as aforesaid; or if any person make or branch any
drain of a different construction, size, or conditions, or in
another manner or form of communication than shall be directed or
appointed by the said board or vestry, every person so offending
shall, for every such offence, forfeit a sum not exceeding fifty
pounds; and the said board or vestry may, if they shall see fit,
execute the necessary works for making the drain conformable to
their directions, at the expense of the person making such drain,
or causing the same to be made, such expenses to be recovered in
a manner hereinafter provided.

The committee consider that this section should be made
to apply also to any person causing the works to be
executed
.

XXX.  The vestry of every parish, and the district
board of every district, shall, with the previous consent in
writing of the Metropolitan Board of Works, have power within
their respective parish or district, to widen, alter, or improve
any street, road, or way, for facilitating passage and traffic;
or to contribute and join with the Metropolitan Board, or with
any other body or persons, in any such improvements; and to take
by agreement or by gift any land, rights in land, or property,
for the purposes aforesaid, or any of them, on such terms and
conditions as they may think fit.

XXXIV.  So much or the 141st section of the first
recited Act as provides that it shall be lawful for the
Metropolitan Board of Works, from time to time, to cause to be
painted or affixed on a conspicuous part of some house or
building at or near each end, corner, or entrance of every street
in the Metropolis the name of such street, and that the said
board may, where more than one street in the Metropolis is called
by the same name, alter the name of any or all such streets,
except one, to any other name which to such board may seem fit,
and which may be approved by the Commissioners of Her
Majesty’s Works and Public Buildings, is hereby repealed,
and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that vestries and district
boards shall and may, within the limits of their respective
jurisdiction, from time to time cause to be painted or affixed on
a conspicuous part of some house or building at or near each end,
corner, or entrance of every street in then parish or district
the name of such street, and renew such name, whenever it may be
obliterated or defaced; and the Metropolitan Board of Works may
alter the name or names of any street, or of any place or row of
houses, or in any line of road, to any other name or names which
to such board may seem convenient and proper, and which may be
approved by the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Works and
Public Buildings.

The committee think the numbering should be also
transferred to vestries
,
&c.

XXXVI.  The 143rd section of the first recited Act is
hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that no
building [
or erection whether temporary or permanent
]
shall without the consent in writing of the Metropolitan Board of
Works be erected [
or made
] beyond the general line of
buildings, in any street, place, or row of houses in which the
same is situate, in case the distance of such line of buildings
from the highway does not exceed thirty feet, or within thirty
feet, of the highway where the distance of the line of buildings
therefrom amounts to or exceeds thirty feet, notwithstanding
there being gardens or vacant spaces between the line of
buildings and the highway; and in case any building be erected
contrary to this enactment, it shall be lawful for the
Metropolitan Board of Works to cause the same to be demolished,
and the materials thereof to be removed to a convenient place, or
to cause such building to be set back (as the case may require),
and to recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the
owner of the premises, in manner hereinafter provided.

The committee think it would be advisable to introduce
after the word
“building,”
the words
,
‘
wall
,
gate
,
fence
,
pier
,
or
other projection
,’
and that the application should
be made and the consent conveyed through vestries
,

&c.

XXXVII.  The 157th section of the first recited Act
is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that the
Metropolitan Board of Works, and any vestry or district board,
may, where necessary for the purpose of executing any work
authorized by this Act, open and break up any turnpike road,
under and subject to the restrictions and provisions hereinafter
contained; that is to say, seven days’ previous notice,
with a full description of any intended works, shall be left at
the office of the Commissioners or trustees of the road; and the
party doing the works shall cause all openings in the road to be
effectually secured and fenced, and affix, and maintain lights
during the night near to the place where the ground is open, so
as to prevent accidents: and the said commissioners or trustees
are hereby absolved from all liability in respect of any accident
arising in consequence of such works; and the party doing the
works shall restore every road so opened or broken up to its
original state as to surface and materials, and in order to meet
the future expenses consequent on the subsidence of materials
newly filled in, shall pay to such commissioners or trustees, on
demand, such sum as they shall require for such purpose, not
exceeding one shilling for every superficial square yard, and, so
far as the works affect the same, shall make good all drainage,
paving of water channels, kerbs of footpaths, and other matters
and things connected with the maintenance of the road; and in
default the surveyor of the said commissioners or trustees may
cause the necessary work to be done; and in all cases of expense
incurred by any such surveyor, on the default of the party doing
the works, such party shall pay such expense to the commissioners
or trustees, on demand.

See remark as to sec.
21.

XLIII.  The Metropolitan Board may order any person
on their behalf from time to time to inspect any of the rates for
the relief of the poor in any parish or place within the limits
of the said Act, and every district board may order any person on
their behalf to inspect any rate for the relief of the poor in
the parishes in their district, or either of them, and the books
in which are contained the assessments by which the same are
made, and to take copies thereof, or any part or parts thereof,
or extracts therefrom respectively.  And it shall be lawful
for the said Metropolitan Board and district boards respectively
by order in writing to require the vestry clerk, overseer,
collector, or other person having the custody or control of such
rate or books as aforesaid of any parish or place to furnish
within
p.
88
such period, not being less than seven days, as shall be
limited in such order, a true copy of such rate book, or of such
part or parts of the rate book in his or their custody, as shall
be specified in such order, on payment or tender for such copy at
the rate of sixpence for every twenty-four names (inclusive of
all the particulars in the several columns of the rate, so far as
such particulars have reference to such names respectively); and
such copy shall be examined and signed by such vestry clerk,
overseer, collector or other person, and shall be verified by his
solemn declaration, if the said metropolitan or district board
shall require the same, which solemn declaration any justice of
the peace, or commissioner duly authorized, is hereby authorized
to administer; and any person having the custody or control of
such rates or books as aforesaid respectively, who shall refuse
or neglect at all reasonable times, to produce the same
respectively to such persons so authorized as aforesaid, and
permit him to inspect the same, and to take copies thereof or
extracts therefrom as he shall think fit, or who shall refuse or
neglect to make and deliver to such person such copy or extract,
or to make such solemn declaration as aforesaid, shall be liable
to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds for every such offence, and
to a further continuing penalty of ten pounds for each and every
day during which the said offence shall be continued.

first recited Act for enabling the clerk or other person
authorized by the Metropolitan Board of Works to inspect or take
copies of, or extracts from county rates, bases, returns, and
other documents; and the penalties by the said enactment
prescribed in the case of neglect of permission or refusal of
inspection, or neglect or refusal of permission for taking copies
or extracts, are hereby extended and made applicable to all other
rates, taxes, and assessments, whether parliamentary, parochial,
or otherwise, within the several parts of the metropolis, or the
other parts liable to assessment by the said board, and the books
in which the same are contained, and the valuations and returns
relating thereto, and the person or persons having the custody or
control thereof.

XLIX.  Whereas the Metropolitan Commissioners of
Sewers in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by the
Act of the 11 and 12 years of Her Majesty, cap. 112, did approve
and adopt certain plans for the main drainage and sewage
interception of the metropolis, and certain sewers and works
included within and forming a portion of the plans so approved
and adopted were constructed and completed by the said
Commissioners, or by the Metropolitan Board of Works, that is to
say, the sewers and works known as the Counter’s Creek
Diversion Works; and whereas the cost of the said works,
amounting to the sum of £43,721 15s., was defrayed by
monies borrowed on certain securities, which securities and
monies are included amongst, and form part of the securities and
monies enumerated in Schedule B to this Act, and the debt so
incurred was charged by the said Commissioners upon the following
sewerage districts, viz., the Counter’s Creek District, the
Ranelagh District, and the Fulham and Hammersmith District, in
certain shares and proportions, and has been apportioned by the
Metropolitan Board of Works, pursuant to the 181st section of the
firstly recited Act, among the several parishes or parts of
parishes which heretofore constituted the said districts, that is
to say, Paddington; Chelsea; St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington; St.
Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster; St. Peter and
St. Paul, Hammersmith; Fulham; Willesden; St. Marylebone; St.
George, Hanover-square; Chelsea; St. John, Hampstead; Acton,
Ealing, and Chiswick; and whereas it is just and expedient that
the cost of and incidental to the construction and execution of
the said sewers and works, amounting to the sum aforesaid, should
be deemed to be, and become part of the expenses of, and
incidental to the works directed by the 135th section of the said
Act for the better Local Management of the Metropolis, to be made
and executed by the said board, for preventing all or any part of
the sewage within the metropolis from flowing or passing into the
Thames in or near the metropolis: be it therefore enacted, that
the costs and charges of the said works, amounting to the sum of
£43,721 15s., and the monies borrowed for defraying the
same, shall cease to be the special debt and obligation of the
said parishes and parts of parishes, and that the same shall be
transferred to the metropolis at large, including the said
parishes and parts of parishes, in the several proportions and in
manner set forth in Schedule B to this
p. 90
Act annexed, and all sums becoming
payable under or required for the payment of any security given
for such monies, or any part thereof, or any interest accruing
thereon, shall be raised by the said Metropolitan Board of Works
upon the City of London and the said other parts of the
metropolis, in the proportion of the annual value of the property
therein, in the same manner as other monies raised for the
expenses of and incidental to the execution of works for
preventing the sewage of the metropolis from flowing or passing
into the Thames in or near the metropolis; and the said board
shall give the said parishes, and parts of parishes, credit for
all sums which may have been overpaid by them, or any of them, in
respect of principal or interest on the said security or
securities (if any), since the 1st day of January, 1856.

The committee wish the sums levied upon the
Counter’s Creek District
,
under former precepts of
Metropolitan Board
,
if not paid by vestries
,

&c.
,
to be returned to the ratepayer or to the
person holding the receipt for the time being

LV.  Any person who shall take up, remove, demolish,
or interfere with any sewer or part of a sewer vested in the
Metropolitan Board of Works, or in any vestry or district board,
without the previous permission in writing of such board or
vestry, or who shall wilfully damage any sewer, bank, defence,
wall, penstock, grating, work or thing vested in the Metropolitan
Board, or any vestry or district board, or do any act by which
the drainage of the metropolis, or of any parish or district or
of any part or parts thereof, may be obstructed or injured, shall
for every such offence forfeit and pay to the said Metropolitan
Board of Works, or to the vestry or district board in which the
same may be vested, for every such offence, a sum not exceeding
twenty pounds, and shall also pay to such board or vestry all the
expenses of repairing, restoring, reinstating, or amending any
sewer or other work or thing so taken up, removed, demolished,
damaged, or interfered with.

LVIII.  The 217th section of the first recited Act is
hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that it shall
be lawful for any vestry or district board, at their discretion,
to require the payment of any costs or expenses which the owner
of any premises may be liable to pay under the said recited Act
or this Act, either from such owner or from any person who then
or at any time thereafter occupies such premises; and the owner
shall allow such occupier to deduct the sums of money which he so
pays out of the rent from time to time becoming due in respect of
the said premises, as if the same had been actually paid to such
owner as part of such rent.

hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that all
penalties or forfeitures payable or receivable under the said
first recited Act, or this Act, shall go and be paid in manner
hereinafter mentioned, anything contained in the Act of the 2nd
and 3rd Vict., c. 71, or in any other Act or Acts to the contrary
notwithstanding, that is to say, one half shall go to the
informer, and the remainder shall go to the vestry or district
board of the parish or district in which the offence was
committed, or to the Metropolitan Board of Works in case the
injury shall have been sustained by or the offence committed in
respect of that board, or if such vestry or district board or the
Metropolitan Board of Works be the informers, then the whole of
the penalty recovered shall go to them respectively, and all sums
which shall go to or be recovered, by any board or vestry on
account of any penalty or forfeiture, shall be paid to their
treasurer or otherwise into such bank to their account as they
may direct, and shall be applicable to the general expenses of
the board or vestry.

LXIII.  No writ or process shall be sued out against
or served upon, and no proceeding shall be instituted against the
Metropolitan Board of Works or any vestry or district board, or
their clerk, or any clerks, surveyor, or other officer or person
whomsoever, acting under their or any of their directions, for
anything done or intended to be done under the powers of such
board or vestry under the said Acts, or this Act, until the
expiration of one month next after notice in writing shall have
been delivered, as herein provided concerning the service of
notices upon such board or vestry, or, where the action or
proceeding shall be against such other officer or person, shall
have been delivered to him or left at his office or place of
abode, explicitly stating the cause of action, or ground of the
proceeding or demand, and the name and place of abode of the
intended plaintiff or claimant, and of his attorney or agent in
the cause or proceeding; and upon the trial of any action the
plaintiff shall not be permitted to go into evidence of any cause
of action except such as is stated in the notice so delivered,
and unless such notice be proved the jury shall find for the
defendant: and every such action and proceeding shall be brought
or commenced within six months next after the accrual of the
cause of action or ground of claim or demand, and not afterwards,
and every such action shall be laid and tried in the county or
place where the cause of action occurred, and not
elsewhere.  And the defendant shall in
p. 92
any such
action be at liberty to plead the general issue, and give the
said recited Acts, and this Act, and all special matter in
evidence thereunder.  And it shall be lawful for the board
or vestry or any person to whom such notice is given as aforesaid
to tender amends to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, at any
time within one month after service of such notice, and in case
the same be not accepted to plead such tender in bar, and (by
leave of the court) with the general issue or other plea or
pleas; and if upon issue joined upon any plea pleaded to the
whole action the jury find generally for the defendant, or if the
plaintiff be nonsuited or discontinued, or if the judgment be
given for the defendant, then the defendant shall be entitled to
full costs of suit and have judgment accordingly.  And in
case amends have not been tendered as aforesaid, or in case the
amends tendered be insufficient, it shall be lawful for the
defendant, by leave of the court, at any time before trial, to
pay into court under plea such sum of money as he may think
proper, and (by the like leave) to plead the general issue or
other plea or pleas, any rule of court or practice to the
contrary notwithstanding.

Dear Sir,—I am directed by the Vestry of this parish to
request that, when your Board shall apply to Parliament for the
further Amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Act, a
clause may be introduced, enacting that so much of the provisions
of the 67th and 68th sections of the 57th George the III., cap.
29, being “An Act for better paving, improving, and
regulating the streets of the Metropolis, and removing and
preventing Nuisances and Obstructions therein,” as relates
to the nuisance arising from hog styes, and to the breeding,
feeding, and keeping of swine, and suffering them to stray, be
extended to the
p.

following parishes and places within the Metropolis,
which were not, at the time of the passing of the said Act,
included in the Weekly Bills of Mortality: that is to
say,—Paddington; Camberwell; Chelsea; St. Mary Abbot,
Kensington; Woolwich; St. John, Hampstead; St. Paul, Deptford,

the penalties imposed by these sections may be recovered in the
manner provided by the 227th section of the Act for the better
Local Management of the Metropolis, 18th and 19th Vict., cap.
120.

Dear Sir,—I am directed by this Vestry to request that
when your Board shall apply to Parliament for the further
Amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 and 19
Vict., cap. 120, the 85th section of that Act may be altered by
the insertion after the first word “works” of words
to the following effect: viz.:—

“And in the case of combined drainage such
notice may require that each house of any block of houses drained
in combination, or so many thereof as the Vestry or Board shall
see fit, shall be drained separately into a sewer.”

Dear Sir,—The Metropolitan Association of Medical
Officers of Health have brought under the consideration of this
Vestry the desirability of extending to the cow houses within the
Metropolis, the system of annual licenses, as it prevails with
regard to slaughter houses, and they have directed me to acquaint
you, for the information of the Metropolitan Board of Works, that
if a proposal is made to provide for such an extension of the
law, in their forthcoming amendment Bill, this Vestry, upon the
recommendation of their Medical Officer of Health, will give such
proposal their cordial support.

I beg to send you a copy of the Report of Dr. Barclay, our
Medical Officer of Health, above alluded to.

Your obedient Servant,

Extract from the Report of the
Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry of the Parish of
Chelsea
.

22nd November, 1859.

At your last meeting I was requested to report upon a
suggestion made to this Vestry by the Metropolitan Association of
Medical Officers of Health, to the effect that you should unite
with other vestries in the endeavour “to procure insertion
in the proposed bill for amending the Metropolis Local Management
Act, of a clause relating to the annual licensing of Cow
Houses.”  I was also requested to consider the
propriety of extending the system of licensing to the keeping of
pigs.

With reference to these two questions, I have to observe, that
the grounds upon which such a proposition rests are mainly two;
viz.:, the
necessity for
such a business being carried on
where it now is, and the probability that such a business may, if
carelessly conducted, be a nuisance to the neighbourhood.
For by the very fact of the license being granted, the option of
endeavouring to remove the cause of nuisance altogether is
entirely given up.  This authority is accorded to the
magistrate, by the Nuisances Removal Act, but is very rarely
exercised in cases brought before the Metropolitan Police Courts,
because it has generally been held that its powers were not
intended to be used for the suppression, but only for the
regulation of offensive trades.

In regard to the keeping of cows throughout the Metropolis, a
necessity exists from which, under present circumstances, we
cannot escape, because, in hot weather, neither milk nor cream
can be brought from a distance in a perfectly sweet and fresh
state, and at no time of year can good cream be obtained from
milk (as I am informed) after a journey.  At the same time,
cow houses badly kept in a town are liable to become a nuisance,
1st by effluvia from the building itself; 2nd, by accumulations
of dung, and annoyances during their removal, of which we have
had several examples in this parish; 3rd, by injury to the health
of the cows, which will consequently yield a supply of unhealthy
milk, or may become the means of diseased meat being sold at the
inferior butchers’ stalls.  Under such circumstances,
it seems not unreasonable that the vestry should seek by
conceding the necessity for their permanence and granting a
license, to place them more completely under the control of their
officers.

Letter from W. Tite
,

Esq.
,
to the Vestry Clerk
.

My dear Sir,

* * * * *

Mr. Woolrych asks me whether the vestry can suggest a clause
to meet the case of combined drainage when it has appeared to
become public drainage by the ill advised arrangements of the
late Commissioners?

This was the point on which I saw him some months since, and
if the vestry wish it, I will try what is to be done; you had
better perhaps give me a call any morning you please.

Yours truly,

William Tite

January 14th, 1860.

Sir,—Not being a lawyer I speak with great diffidence on
the subject of your note of the 7th, but it appears to me that if
an alteration were made in the interpretation clause of the Local
Management Act, as to the meaning of the word
“drain,” it would accomplish what we wish.

It now runs thus, “the word ‘drain’ shall
mean and include any drain of and used for the drainage of one
building only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made
merely for the purpose of communicating with a cesspool or other
like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the
drainage of two or more buildings or premises, occupied by
different persons, is conveyed,
and shall also include any
drain for draining any group or block of houses by a combined
operation
,
under the order of any vestry or district
board
.”  I would suggest that the following words
be added “or under the order, sanction, or direction of any
Commissioners of Sewers, acting within the metropolis previous to
the passing of the Act for the better Local Management of the
metropolis, 18 and 19 Vic. Cap. 120.”

Combined
Drainage
.

Pig Sty Regulations
.

These two matters formed the subjects of my communication to
Mr. Pollard, of the 29th ultimo, and copies of them were on the
same day sent to you.  They both have reference to the
amendment of the Act, and were recommended to the vestry by Dr.
Barclay, the Medical Officer of Health.

Metropolis
Local Management Act Amendment Bill
.

Dear Sirs,—You may have observed that Mr. Tite
introduced this Bill into the House of Commons on Monday evening,
consequently no time must be lost in seeing him with reference to
the following matters.

It is unfortunate that the Bill accompanying your letter of
the 24th ultimo was not the last reprint: however, I beg to send
you a copy of the last reprint, which you will observe differs in
some particulars, and as to the numbers of the clauses, from the
former one.

With reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, and the Bill
accompanying it, they were referred by the Vestry on that day to
the Committee of Works, and they met yesterday to consider
them.

I beg to send you an extract from the Minutes with reference
to them.

I am, dear Sirs,

Your obedient Servant,

Chas. Lahee
,

Vestry Clerk.

Extract from the Minutes of a
Meeting of the Committee of Works and for General Purposes
,

held in the Board Room
,
Manor House
,

Tuesday
,
May
1
st
, 1860,

The Committee considered the letter of the Solicitors (Messrs.
Lee and Pemberton), dated 24th of April, respecting the Bill for
the Amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Act.  The
Clerk laid upon the table 12 copies of the last reprint of the
Bill, and reported that the Bill had been introduced the previous
evening in the House of Commons by Mr. Tite, M.P.

Resolved,—That this Committee
do not
concur with
the Solicitors in their remarks upon the Bill accompanying their
letter respecting the following five clauses:—

Clause
11, enacting that any Vestry
or District Board may pay the precepts of the Metropolitan Board
of Works out of any money in their possession, and reimburse
themselves out of the Sewers Rate.
Remark referred
to
:—‘We think this clause very objectionable; it
appears to involve a breach of trust on the part of the
Vestry.  Funds raised for one purpose should not be applied
to another; and the effect is to give the Metropolitan Board of
Works a first charge on every Rate collected.  What does the
Poor Law Board say to it?’

Clause
13, enacting that if any
Vestry, &c., neglect to pay the money required by the
precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board may make
a rate on default, without awaiting the expiration of the period
fixed by the precept.
Remark referred
to
:—‘Two months is not enough, it should at least
be four.’

Clause
41, relating to the case of
a Vestryman—a member of a District Board—not
attending meetings for six months.
Remark referred
to
:—‘Or committee thereof.  We think this
inexpedient.  The member should go out as if by rotation,
and be ineligible for the vacancy so created.’

Clause
60, relative to
contributions to the cost of main sewers and sewers built since
January 1st, 1856, or hereafter to be built.
Remark
referred to
:—‘Leave out these words (lines 32 and
33, ‘at their discretion’).’

Clause
62, prescribing the
regulations to be observed in making openings into sewers.

Remark referred to
:—‘We think this clause is
better out, unless it is made to go further.  The Vestry
should have power to alter old drains.’

Resolved
,—That if in the opinion of the
Solicitors further powers are requisite than are contained in the
above clause, they be authorized to prepare such a clause.

Resolved
,—That this Committee
do
concur
with the solicitors in their remarks respecting the following ten
clauses, and authorize them to prepare clauses to give effect to
their recommendations.

Clause
22, relative to the recovery
of moneys assessed by the Metropolitan Board of Works on extra
parochial property for payment of debts.
Remark referred
to
—‘Instead of ‘a justice’ should be
‘two justices or a police magistrate,’ the same error
occurs in other parts of the Bill.’

Clause
42, providing that owners
and occupiers of land may execute drainage works at their own
expense.
Remark referred to
:—‘We think
the sewer when built should vest in the Vestry.  It should
be built under the superintendence
p. 99
of their Surveyor; and the party
applying should find sureties for the performance of the work,
under penalties, to be recoverable as liquidated
damages.’

Resolved
,—That in the opinion of this Committee
the words in line 21 ‘hereinafter mentioned’ should
stand, with the interlineation ‘
or
that any Vestry
may think proper to attach.’

Clause
48, prescribing the
regulations to be observed on abandonment, alteration, &c.,
of designs for sewers previously approved by the Metropolitan
Board of Works.
Remark referred to
:—‘And
in case they do there should be a heavy penalty recoverable by
action.’

Clause
66, empowering Vestries,
&c., on neglect of owners, &c., to carry out works,
pursuant to orders, to proceed for the penalties, or do the works
themselves, and recover the cost.
Remark referred
to
:—‘Line 27 erase ‘person or
persons,’ insert ‘such owner or
occupier.’  Line 37 insert ‘or
occupier.’

Clause
67, extending penalties to
persons causing offences.
Remark referred
to
:—‘And all penalties recoverable under this
Act.’

Clause
69, empowering Vestries,
&c., to compel supply of water to houses.
Remark
referred to
:—‘We do not think this clause will
work, unless a power be invested for making the expense a first
charge; it will be nugatory and will cause useless expense.

Clause
74, empowering Vestries,
&c., with sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to
effect improvements within their districts, &c.

Remark referred to
:—‘We think this clause
requires remodelling.  It does not go far enough.  We
think the clauses for improving streets in the Towns improvement
Clauses Act should be embodied in this Act, particularly sec. 67;
and also the clauses of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act,
enabling the Vestry to take compulsory possession of
land.’

Clause
75, enacting that buildings
projecting beyond the general line of the street, where taken
down to an extent exceeding one half, shall be set back to the
general line.
Remark referred to
:—‘This
should be extended to Vestries with the consent of the
Metropolitan Board of Works.’

Clause
78, empowering Vestries
&c. to drain and pave courts, &c. on default of owners,
in lieu of enforcing penalties.
Remark referred
to
:—‘The judgment when recovered should be a
first charge on the property, with power of sale in default of
payment, on three month’s notice affixed on the
premises.’

Clause
93, enacting that a Vestry
or District Board may require payment of costs or expenses from
an owner or occupier, and the occupier paying to deduct from
rent.
Remark referred to
:—‘We do not
think the clause goes far enough.  The Vestry to be properly
protected against their enormous outlay, should have a statutable
charge upon the premises for moneys expended by them recovered by
judgment.  We see no reason why the Vestry should not have a
power of sale something similar to that given to the
Commissioners of Police under the 74th section of the
Metropolitan Buildings Act, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 122; unless
this is effectually done, the annual loss to every parish which
carries out the intentions of the Metropolis Local Management
Act, must be considerable; the Act will become a dead letter, or
Vestries must be protected from loss.’

p.
100
Resolved
,—That the attention of the
Solicitors be directed to the discrepancy between the marginal
note to Clause 52, and the body of the clause.

Resolved
,—That the Solicitors do endeavour to
obtain the following alterations:—Clause 90 in the Bill
above referred to, line 29, omit the words, ‘which may be
unfit for the keeping of swine, or where the breeding, feeding,
or keeping swine may create a nuisance or be injurious to
health,’ in order to insert the words, ‘within forty
yards of any street.’

Line 31, insert after the word ‘place’ the words,
‘or in any locality, premises, or place in such manner as
to be a nuisance to other persons residing near
thereto.’

Resolved
,—That the Solicitors and the Vestry
Clerk be instructed to arrange with Mr. Tite as to the best mode
of obtaining the above alterations in the Bill now before
Parliament.

Metropolis
Local Management Act Amendment Bill
.

Sir,

I am directed to send you copy of a Petition of this Vestry to
the House of Commons respecting your Bills (Nos. 1 & 2) for
Amending the Metropolis Local Management Act, which Lord Enfield
has been requested to present.

I am also to send you the four new clauses and amendments
which are referred to in the prayer of the Petition, and to
request that you will obtain the introduction of them into the
Bill No. 1.

I have the honor to be, Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

Chas. Lahee
,

Vestry Clerk.

W. Tite, Esq., M.P., &c., &c.,

42, Lowndes Square.

To the Honourable the Commons of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament
assembled
.

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea,
in the County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

That Your Petitioners are informed and believe that two Bills,
intituled respectively “The Metropolis Local Management Act
Amendment Bills, Nos. 1 & 2,” are now before your
Honourable House, by the first of which relief is proposed to be
given to the late Counter’s Creek separate sewerage
district in this parish, for certain sums expended in respect of
the Counters Creek Diversion Works, and improperly charged upon
the said district in respect of the construction of sewers and
works for the general benefit of the Metropolis; and by the other
it is intended to settle upon equitable principles the parishes,
districts, and parts, upon which certain debts of the
Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers shall stand charged, having
regard to the benefit derived by those parishes, &c.,
respectively from such expenditure.

p. 101
That
under the Act for the Better Local Management of the Metropolis,
18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, the Metropolitan Board of Works found
themselves unable, from the defective powers of the said Act, to
give any relief to the said Counters Creek District from payment
of the charges upon it above mentioned, and in consequence
thereof a great amount of dissatisfaction has existed in this and
other districts similarly circumstanced.

That in consequence of such and other defects in the practical
working of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestries and
District Boards constituted under the said Act have instigated
the Metropolitan Board to introduce the said Bills to your
Honourable House to remedy the same, and for other purposes.

That your Petitioners being by the said Metropolis Local
Management Act constituted the authority to order the levying of
the rates under the said Act, have incurred a considerable amount
of unpopularity and censure in performing a duty which is against
their own consciences, and repulsive to the feelings of the
ratepayers residing in that district.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House
that the said Bill, with certain amendments and new clauses which
your Petitioners propose to endeavour to effect the introduction
of, when in Committee may pass into law.

And your Petitioners will ever pray.

Chas.
Lahee
,

Vestry Clerk.

Given under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 23rd day
of April, 1861.

The Four New Clauses
.

1.—In Clause 46, line four, for the words
“twenty-six” substitute the word
“thirteen;” add a clause after said clause as
follows:—“If any member of the Metropolitan Board of
Works shall be absent from the meetings of the said Board for
thirteen consecutive weeks, he shall thereupon cease to be a
member of the said Board; and the said Metropolitan Board of
Works shall immediately send notice of the fact to the Vestry or
District Board by which such member was elected, whereupon which
Vestry or District Board shall forthwith proceed to elect a new
member for the said Metropolitan Board in the room of the member
so ceasing to be a member as aforesaid; and such election shall
be conducted in accordance with the 44th, 45th, and 46th sections
of the firstly-recited Act, so far as the same are respectively
applicable.”

2.—Provided always that in construing the 6th section of
the firstly-recited Act, in calculating the number of Poor Rate
assessments in any parish, each house, or piece or parcel of
land, tenement, or hereditament rated to the relief of the poor,
shall be counted and taken as a separate Poor Rate
assessment.

3.—Notwithstanding anything in the said recited Acts or
this Act to the contrary, Be it enacted, that the Vestry of the
Parish of Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, shall from time to
time raise and levy the sums which they may require for defraying
the expenses of executing the said Acts and this Act, and shall
for that purpose make separate equal pound rates upon their
parish or part thereof, in like manner as overseers are required
to do with respect to the sums
p. 102
for which orders are by the
firstly-recited Act directed to be made upon them by Vestries and
District Boards; and shall in raising such sums act upon the like
principles, and have the like discretion, as provided in the
firstly-recited Act with respect to orders upon Overseers by
Vestries and District Boards, subject to the provisions of this
Act, and shall for that purpose have free access to, and be at
liberty to copy or adopt any assessment to the Poor Rate in the
said parish, or any part or parts of such assessment; and such
Vestry shall have power to appoint a collector or collectors for
levying the amount of such rates, and to pay him or them such
salary, poundage, or allowance as they may deem just and
reasonable; and shall take such security from every such
collector for the due execution of his duty as they shall think
reasonable and proper; and such collector or collectors shall
proceed in the same manner, and shall have the same powers and
remedies, and be subject to the same regulations and directions
with reference to the levying of such rates, as if he or they
were an overseer or overseers of the poor, and shall pay over the
amount of such rates to the said Vestry or otherwise, as such
Vestry may direct; and such collector or collectors shall, when
and in such manner as shall be required by the said Vestry, make
out and deliver a true and perfect account in writing, signed by
him or them, of all monies received by him or them, in manner
provided by the 65th section of the firstly-recited Act; and in

CHELSEA CHARITIES.

The Articles in the
West Middlesex Advertiser

referred to in Mr. Druce’s letter at page
20,
in
the Report
.

April 7, 1860.

The peculiar position in which the parish of St. Luke’s,
Chelsea, at the present moment stands, induces every one
interested to prevent by every possible means the occurrence of
future discord arising from what may in after years be difficult
to correct.  Probably for many years, no period has ever
existed in which the parish of Chelsea has been more dependent on
the wise action of its patrons, property holders, and inhabitants
in general than at the present moment.  Circumstances having
afforded us opportunities of acquiring much knowledge of its
affairs generally, and deeming that the kindest act would be to
communicate some portions of that knowledge to our
fellow-parishioners, we venture to intrude the following matters
on their attention.  Our readers are aware of the movement
made with reference to the assessments, but they may also know
from personal experience, the great difficulty of the question,
and from having been for some years, careful observers of the
actions of many of those gentleman who bestow so much of their
time and ability on parochial affairs, we are thoroughly
convinced, that such matters are carefully and honestly
administered; and although the watchful check of the ratepayers
and other Societies is very beneficial, we doubt whether much
good would arise from any material change.  The attention of
the Vestry, and the separation to some extent of church matters
from the general interests of the parish, has deprived its
officers of the advantage of a “legal vestry clerk,”
and thus the local authorities in whom are vested many of its
charities have lost their best and proper adviser, and many of
the charity interests are not in such a state as they should be
in a well-ordered parish; for instance, the sums of money
belonging to the St. Luke’s, Chelsea, parochial school
stand thus—

£764 13s. 4d., the gift of Earl Cadogan, stands in the
name of Lee Jortin, Esq., and others, some of whom have passed
away, and Mr. Jortin, is not so strong in health as his friends
would wish him.

£692 2s. 4d., the gift of Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Bryan,
stands in the name of the Rev. Chas. Kingsley and Philip Burrard,
both dead.

£100 the gift of Mr. P. Burrard, stands in the name of
the Rev. C. Kingsley and Mr. Walker, both dead.

£450 the gift of Mrs. MacPherson,

£445 14s. 7d., the gift of Charles Walker, Esq., stand
in the name of the Rev. Charles Kingsley and Mr. W. Druce.
Thus supposing the first to be in safe trust, the two next are
without any trustees, and the two last, in the name of one
individual, which is not as it should be.

p.
105
Again, Chamberlain’s Charity is for educating
boys in the parochial school, and then apprenticing them; the
Vestry elects the boys, and the parochial officers ought to do
the rest, but the money is placed in the Savings’ Bank, and
there we suppose it rests; there is a sum of money also lying at
the parish bankers to the credit of the Chelsea charities, which
we much suspect belongs to this charity, this sum has been lying
unused for many years: it is also the duty of the parochial
officers to see that the money paid for the benefit of the school
children under Mr. Flood’s gift is properly applied: the
treasurer of the schools cannot be expected to apprentice the
children, so this money also finds its way into the
Savings’ Bank.  It is in these cases that the loss of
the legal Vestry Clerk is felt, as from the nature of the present
Vestry, and the limitation as to powers of interference with
church matters, renders the assistance of the able Clerk of the
Vestry, as now constituted, of no avail.  The question also
of the Church Trustees is in a very peculiar state; there is
great uncertainty as to their powers.  A most careful
examination of the conflicting clauses of the Act creates great
doubt as to whether the power of the Trustees to make a rate does
actually expire at the present period, as is generally
believed.  If their powers of rating do expire, they will
find themselves with an important trust to carry out without the
means of performing their trust.  We think it would tend
much to the well-being of the parish generally if the Vestry, on
Easter Tuesday, were to appoint a committee to inquire and report
on the course it may be desirable to pursue with respect to the
Church Trust.  It must be the wish of everyone that the
power to rate should cease absolutely, and that we should never
again hear of a church rate in the parish of Chelsea.
Possibly a short Act of Parliament, annulling the present Board
of Trustees, and putting an end to the Act, would be the best
mode of proceeding; thus leaving the Rector and Incumbent of the
churches and the Church Officers to take charge of their own
interests, taking the revenue of the church and making the best
of it; the removal of the expense of the Board of Trustees, and a
moderate contribution of the congregations towards the expense of
what may be called church luxuries would meet the necessity of
the case.  Without great care and consideration this matter
may become a troublesome and annoying parochial question.
The old Rector has passed away, a new one has been appointed; let
us not forget that, amidst the doctrinal disquisition and
rubrical eccentricities of which we have heard so much, we have
enjoyed, under the former, a quarter of a century of religious
peace, and let us hope that the wise actions of the new one may
tend to increase the affectionate feeling so many of us hold for
the memory of his father and grandfather.

Though the name of Mr.
Loveland
is
always spoken of with the greatest respect as the former vestry
clerk of this parish, yet we by no means wish to infer the
necessity of a legal gentleman filling that office.  We
believe that it could not be in better hands than it is, and we
have felt it to be our duty, on more occasions than one, to
express our warm approbation of the conduct of
p. 106
Mr.
Lahee
.  Litigation will arise in every
parish, and may be promoted to a very great extent by the
appointment of attorneys, and even if it were not so they would
get the credit and the obloquy, and therefore should not be
placed in so unenviable a position.

Mr. Toulmin Smith says, ‘It may be safely stated, that
it will be usually the wisest course not to appoint a person of
the legal profession to the office of vestry clerk.  It is
quite unnecessary to the discharge of any of his duties that he
should be of that profession; while his being so has a tendency
to encourage a narrow technical mode of dealing with the duties
of the parish, and very often indeed lead to litigation, for
which there is no real occasion whatever.

‘Every parish should, however, have some known and
confidential professional man of the neighbourhood, to whom it
should refer on occasions needing professional action or
advice.’

Again, in Brady and Mahon’s work on Parochial Law and
Taxation it is said, ‘A custom has prevailed of late years
of appointing attorneys as vestry clerks.  The numberless
statutes by which parochial affairs are now regulated, give
something like a satisfaction to this practice, and the
conflicting decision of the courts of law on parish cases, would
lead to a belief that none but a lawyer could be qualified for
the office.  But whatever may be the cause, the fact appears
to be unquestionable that such appointments have tended greatly
to the increase of parochial expenditure; for the professional
gentlemen thus selected as vestry clerks, however unjust it may
be to attribute to them obliquity, foul play or evil designs very
naturally carry with them into office a sort of
esprit du
corps
which leads to appeals to quarter sessions, vexatious
removals, litigious contests, journies half over the kingdom, the
inevitable consequence of which is an enormous annual
expenditure, amounting, it is said, to something like one third
of the total poor rates!’

With such statements as these emanating from lawyers it would
be absurd to argue for the continuance of a practice fraught with
such imminent danger to the pockets of the parishioners.

CREMORNE GARDENS.

Report of the Committee of Works
and for General Purposes
.

Board Room, Manor House, September
24th, 1860.

To the Vestry of the Parish of
Chelsea.

Gentlemen,—We, the undersigned, of your Committee of
Works and for General Purposes, beg to present the following
special report upon the resolution passed by you on the 11th
instant (25):—

“That the Committee of Works be requested to
consider the whole question relating to Cremorne Gardens as to
past proceedings, present injury and annoyance to the
parishioners, and the probable increase of such damage and
nuisance in consequence of the proposed change from one
proprietor to a company; to report thereon, and the course they
would recommend to be adopted to mitigate, and, if necessary, put
an end to the evil.”

With reference to the first portion of the enquiry we have had
laid before us, the whole record of your former proceedings, with
the evidence taken before the licensing magistrates in 1857,
which we have attentively considered; and we are of opinion that
the second report presented by the Committee at that time
contains much that is valuable, and only requires to obtain due
publicity to have a great effect in diminution of the evils to
which it adverts—evils which the unfavourable weather
during the past season has prevented from becoming so intolerable
as during the seasons of 1858 and 1859, but which the return of a
hot summer, and the intended change from the direct
responsibility attaching to one proprietorship to the
infinitesimally reduced responsibility of the individual
shareholders in a public company would, in the opinion of your
Committee, largely increase.

Nor, it is to be feared, would these evils be confined as
heretofore to the summer months, for the prospectus of the new
company offers the bait to shareholders that the gardens may be
made profitable during the winter also.

Having regard therefore to the magnitude of the question with
which we have to deal, and the advice of a sub-committee
appointed by us to consult the solicitors as to the course to be
pursued, we recommend that the report before alluded to, be
printed and circulated, and that a petition be presented
forthwith to the licensing magistrates, praying that the hour of
closing Cremorne Gardens may be made twelve o’clock at
night, as has been the case with other public gardens, and that
the solicitors be instructed to take all necessary steps in that
behalf.

Respectfully submitted,

Report of a Committee appointed
to investigate the State of the Town Meadows called

“
The Lotts
,”
April
18
th
,
1834.

“We have seen the land, and behold it is
very good.”—Judges xviii. 9.

Mr. Chairman,—Agreeably to the Resolution passed at the
last Board relative to the appointment of a Committee to go and
view the meadow-land called “the Lotts,” I have now
to inform you, Sir, and the Committee at large, that we proceeded
thither on Friday morning, and upon arrival, we found the gates
locked up; we, however, procured the key of the adjoining lands
which communicate with “the Lotts,” of a woman who
lives in the late Mr. Brown’s cottage.

After proceeding to the western extremity of the meadow, we
found that a large bank had been thrown up at the time of the
cutting of the canal, and that by this means perhaps one fourth
part of the land had been lost, or taken away to widen the canal;
but we were of opinion that this bank might be gradually levelled
and sloped down on the meadow below, so as to elevate it, and
render it free from inundation, and thus make it more fit for any
kind of cultivation or pasture.  And we were all moreover
unanimously of opinion, that it would be highly desirable to
obtain re-possession of this valuable piece of land for the use
of the parishioners.

No determination, however, as to the means by which this most
desirable object could be effected was formed on this occasion,
and I am humbly of opinion that the Committee must continue their
earnest endeavours, in order to obtain all possible evidence upon
this difficult and complicated case.  It seems proper to
observe, in this stage of the business, that “the
Lotts” are Lammas Land, and have been for ages appurtenant
to the Manor of Chelsea.  The Lord of the Manor possesses
the right of letting the land on lease, for the Spring and Summer
quarters, beginning with March and ending in August; and the
inhabitants at large enjoy the privilege of turning in their
cattle from August till February, being the Autumn and Winter
quarters.  This state of appropriation continued till the
year 1825 or 1826, when the Directors of the Kensington Canal
Company took unlawful possession of them for their own use,
immediately upon the completion of their Canal; and they have
illegally detained them ever since, and have let them
successively to several persons, and received rent for the
same.  It now, therefore, becomes a question, by what
authority they have shut out the ancient inhabitants, landowners,
and householders from their undoubted privilege of turning in
their cattle to graze, a privilege which they have
uninterruptedly enjoyed for a succession of ages, and which they
are confident has never been on their part either invalidated or
annulled.

It must not, however, be concealed on this occasion, that it
has been confidently reported from many quarters that money was
offered to the parishioners for the surrender of their rights to
these lands, by the Directors of the Canal
p. 109
Company;
and that money was accepted by the Churchwardens of that time;
for their Act of Parliament specially declares that the
Churchwardens, Overseers, and four Freeholders appointed in
Vestry, only shall receive and be accountable for all monies paid
for land under this act.

But after the most diligent enquiry relative to any money
transactions, or to the execution of any bond, or deed, or lease,
or assignment, we have the affirmation in writing of one of the
then Churchwardens, denying the receipt of any money, or
compensation whatever; and as this Churchwarden is a man of
probity, we are, of course, bound to place every degree of
confidence in his averment.  It is also necessary to
mention, that the Directors of the Kensington Canal Company have
become bankrupt since the completion of the Canal, and that any
legal proceedings on our part to endeavour to obtain any money
from them, either as compensation for damages done to the lands,
or for rent, would only involve the parish in useless
expense.

Your Committee, therefore, after a most careful and diligent
investigation, are of opinion that it would be prudent to wait
patiently until the twelfth day of August next, and on that day
those inhabitants who have been accustomed to turn in their
cattle to graze, should proceed thither with some horses and
cows, preceded by the Parish Beadle, Rector, Churchwardens,
Overseers, and such Members of the Parochial Committee, and other
inhabitants, as may think proper, and if upon their arrival they
find the gates locked up, they be ordered to break them open, and
turn in their cattle as they have been accustomed to do from time
immemorial.

In conclusion, permit me to apologize to you, Sir, for the
length of this Report, and humbly to hope that the extreme
importance of the case affecting the ancient and undoubted
privileges of the inhabitants of this Parish will form a
sufficient apology; and finally, permit me to hope, Sir, that you
and every other Member of this Committee will cordially and
zealously assist me in my earnest endeavours to obtain the
re-possession of these lands.

Resolved
, unanimously, that the thanks of the Committee
be given to Mr. Faulkner for his able Report, and that it be
entered in the Minute Book, and printed and circulated throughout
the Parish.

CHELSEA HOSPITAL GROUNDS.

To the Right Honourable William
Cowper
,
M.P.
,
Chief Commissioner of Her
Majesty’s Works and Public Buildings
.

The Memorial of the Vestry of the
Parish of Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

That your Memorialists are sensible of, and grateful for, the
benefit which has resulted to their parish and to the public from
the improvements which have of late years been made in the
grounds of the Royal Hospital, and from their having been thrown
open for the recreation and resort of the crowded neighbouring
population.

That by the present regulations, the grounds are closed during
the months of May, June, July, and August, at eight o’clock
in the evening.

That an extension of the time of closing the gardens,
particularly on Sunday evenings, would, in the opinion of your
Memorialists, be much esteemed by their frequenters; and as
evidence that this would be so, a correspondent of your
Memorialists writes: “An extension of the time of closing
the Royal Hospital Grounds to the same hours as Battersea Park,
would be accepted as a great boon by all classes, more especially
on the Sunday evenings in the hot weather, as, though the grounds
are opened on Sundays at two o’clock in the afternoon, they
are not generally much attended till after tea, which makes it
half-past six o’clock, or even seven, before the mass of
visitors arrive (according to the distance they have to come, as
many come from London by the steamboats), and at a quarter to
eight o’clock in the very height of summer, they begin to
clear the grounds, and at eight o’clock precisely they are
finally closed.

It is naturally felt to be a great hardship to be so turned
out when the sun is shining brightly on a warm summer evening,
and when, though comparatively early, still too late to go
anywhere else (except Cremorne), and the consequences may at once
be seen by the fact of the public houses and beer shops in the
neighbourhood being immediately filled, a state of things much to
be deplored.

Persons attending a place of worship are of course quite
precluded from taking a walk round the grounds when they come
out, and before they go home, the grounds being closed so
early.

The comforts and rest of the inmates of the Royal Hospital
need not be interfered with, as the public could be shut off the
central part at a certain hour, if thought desirable, and all
might leave the grounds by the eastern and
p. 111
western
entrances; and if the additional hour’s duty be thought too
much for the pensioners, three or four policemen additional, or
other attendants, could be provided at a very small additional
expense.

Your Memorialists therefore respectfully request that you will
consider the foregoing, and give directions that the regulations
for closing the said grounds may be assimilated to those of
Battersea Park.

And your Memorialists will ever pray.

THAMES EMBANKMENT.

To the Right Honorable the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea in the
County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

That there is now pending before your Honorable House a Bill
entitled “A Bill to continue the Duties on Coal and Wine by
the Corporation of London.”

That the provisions of the said Bill appear to your
petitioners to be pre-eminently calculated to accomplish a great
object—viz., the Embankment of the River Thames, and to
provide a low level north sewer within the same.

That the inhabitants of the kingdom, and particularly of the
metropolis, are greatly interested in the accomplishment of these
measures.

That unless this Bill is passed into a law there will be no
means of embanking the Thames, except by an increase of taxation
of the inhabitants of the metropolis, who are already so heavily
taxed by the Main Drainage Rate, and the Sewers and other rates
under the various acts of parliament recently passed for public
improvements, and for sanitary purposes, that they are unable to
bear any additional burthen.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honorable House
that the said Bill may pass into law.

And your petitioners will pray, &c.

PAROCHIAL ASSESSMENTS BILL.

To the Honourable the Commons of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament
assembled
.

The petition of the Vestry of the
Parish of Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

1.  That a Bill has been introduced into your honourable
House, intituled, “A Bill to Amend the Law relating to
Parochial Assessments in England.”

2.  That your Petitioners view with much alarm many of
the provisions of the said Bill.

3.  That your Petitioners humbly submit that the present
law on the subject is based upon sound principles, and has in the
main been found to be efficient in its operation.

4.  That your Petitioners believe that the present law
gives all necessary protection to those who suffer from the evils
resulting from unjust and unequal assessments.

5.  That the present assessors, namely the Board of
Guardians of the Poor of this Parish, are in consequence of their
appointment by the parishioners, directly amenable to the voice
of public opinion.

6.  That by the present Bill it is proposed, that in by
far the greater number of cases, the assessors should be
appointed for life, by, and from amongst the Crown appointed
Magistrates of the County.

7.  That your Petitioners believe that the levying and
the disbursing of County Rates by a Board wholly irresponsible to
the ratepayers, is a source of general dissatisfaction throughout
the country, dissatisfaction which will be greatly increased when
the large additional powers contemplated in the Bill are
conferred upon the Board.

8.  That the right at present possessed by the ratepayers
of appeal to the General Quarter Sessions against the original
assessment, is by the said Bill taken away, except in the few
cases in which some principle of rating may be involved.

9.  That the evils which it is alleged have arisen under
the present law, may in the opinion of your Petitioners, be
remedied by a far less cumbrous and costly machinery than that
proposed by the said Bill.

10.  That the said Bill will, if it pass into law, give
unprecedented and unconstitutional powers to the Assessment
Boards created under it.

11.  Your Petitioners, for the foregoing reasons
therefore, humbly pray that the said Bill may not pass into
law.

ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE PARISH OF CHELSEA.

Statistics laid before Lord
Palmerston on the
5
th March
, 1861.

The united parishes of Chelsea and Kensington, according to
the census in 1851, contained a population of upwards of 100,000
persons; and they are now rated under Schedule A to the income
and property tax, at £693,860.

Of the total number of cities and boroughs in the United
Kingdom, returning members to parliament, fifteen only are rated
higher to the income and property tax than Chelsea and
Kensington, while 240 are rated at a less amount.

There is no un-enfranchised town in the United Kingdom
containing half the population, or assessed at half the amount of
property under Schedule A; and it is therefore respectfully
contended that the inhabitants of Chelsea and Kensington have a
paramount claim to any new borough representation that may be
created by the legislature.

To the Honorable the Commons of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament
assembled
.

The Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex,

Sheweth
,

That your Petitioners having had under consideration a Bill
about to be introduced into your honorable House by Viscount
Enfield, to transfer the two seats formerly possessed by the
Borough of St. Albans, in the County of Hertford, to the Parishes
of St. Luke, Chelsea, and St. Mary, Abbott’s Kennington,
respectfully represent—

That the claims of the Parish represented by your Petitioners
for direct and separate representation in Parliament are based

inter alia
upon its wealth, population, intelligence, and
extent.

That the estimated annual value of the house property in the
Parish is about £315,000.

That the Parish of Chelsea extends from the City of
Westminster to Fulham, and contained at the census of 1851,
56,538 inhabitants, and 8,252 houses.

That since the census of 1851, the number of inhabitants has
largely increased, and may be now estimated at 75,000: the number
of houses has also become augmented in like proportion.

That the number of rated householders, according to the last
return, was 4,542, and of persons rated, 5,014; but of this
number about 700 only enjoy the Parliamentary franchise.

That the Parish represented by your Petitioners occupies an
area of 771 acres, and contains upwards of 21 miles of
streets.

That the rateable value of property in the Parish, as assessed
to the County Rate, is £234,248; to the Poor Rate,
£213,115; and to the Property Tax, £267,897.

That the persons qualified to serve on juries in the Parish
now number 1233.

That there are 23 churches and chapels, and 46 public schools
of popular education in the Parish, besides several public
reading rooms and places for mutual instruction.

Your Petitioners therefore pray your honorable House that the
Bill of Viscount Enfield for transferring the two seats formerly
possessed by the Borough of St. Albans, in the County of
Hertford, to the Parishes of St. Luke, Chelsea, and St. Mary,
Abbott’s Kennington, may pass into law.

And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c.

Chas.
Lahee
,

Vestry Clerk.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS, 1860.

We, the undersigned Auditors of Accounts of the Vestry of
Chelsea for the year ending March 25, 1860, present the following
report thereon:—

We feel that the accounts submitted to us are not only clear
and correct in themselves, but that they also appear to be
presented in a much simpler and more convenient form than in
previous years, although there still appears to be room for
improvement in those departments which relate to the expenditure
incurred under the direction of the Surveyor.  We especially
feel that some plan should be adopted for obtaining a receipt or
signature periodically from the labourers employed by him, so as
to assimilate the vouchers in the labour department, as nearly as
circumstances will allow, to those for other departments of
expenditure.

We feel it to be especially important that a fuller and more
intelligible system be introduced in reference to deposits paid
to the Vestry on account of Drainage Works and Surveyor’s
Licenses, in order that the amounts actually expended in respect
of such deposits may be brought to account so soon as the works
are completed, instead of, as at present, being brought to
account only when the depositor claims the return of the balance
of his deposit; thus leaving it possible that the mere neglect or
ignorance of the depositor may occasion deposit accounts to be
left open and unchecked for years, and that even where sums may
be expended in excess of such deposits, the fact may never come
to the knowledge of the Vestry Clerk, and that consequently no
claim may be made on account of such additional expenditure.

We think, further, that the book which contains a record of
such deposits might, by additional columns of reference, be
brought into most useful connexion with the accounts of the
Vestry for payment of the contractors or others by whom the works
are actually executed; thus increasing the facilities for testing
the integrity and propriety of such accounts, and affording more
ready access to any information which depositors may require in
respect of expenditure incurred on their behalf.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS, 1861.

We, the undersigned, have audited the accounts of the Vestry
of St. Luke, Chelsea, for the year expiring 25th March, 1861, and
allowed the same except the item of £21 14s. 9d., charged
as the deficiency on the “Inauguration Dinner,” which
after mature consideration we are of opinion, cannot properly be
charged against the Vestry funds.

We find the sum of £533 6s. 8d., amount of Precept dated
8th March, 1856, uncollected and carried forward from year to
year, and would suggest, that such item be disposed of, by
payment being enforced, or the amount written off.  There
does not appear to be any examination of the amount drawn by the
Surveyor for, and that paid to, labourers, and although attention
to this has been drawn by the auditors of the last year’s
accounts, no alteration seems to have been made.  We think
that the Inspector of the Roads should sign the Surveyor’s
wages book each week, in testimony of the number of men charged
for, having been employed.

In conclusion, we desire to state our thorough satisfaction
with the mode in which the accounts are kept, and to express our
full appreciation of the courtesy and assistance received from
Mr. Lahee during our audit of such accounts.

To the Vestry of St. Luke, Chelsea.

and by one other Vestryman who was also present.

6.  No motion or discussion shall be allowed upon the

9.  Every Notice of Motion shall be written in a book to
be kept for the purpose, and called the “Notice of Motions
Book,” by the Vestryman giving such notice, who shall sign
his name, together with the date of his signature, which date
shall be at least seven days before the time fixed for the next
meeting; and no Notice of Motion shall be altered or withdrawn
after such signature, without leave of the Board.

10.  All Notices of Motion, duly entered in such Notice
Book, shall be printed in the Notice of the next ordinary Vestry
Meeting, in the order of their entry.

11.  Any motion, of which notice has been given, shall be
proposed by the Vestryman who has given the notice; but in case
of absence he may depute to another Vestryman his right to move,
or any other Vestryman may bring forward such motion, or move a
negative thereto.

12.  Every motion and amendment must be in writing, and

Chairman) in answer to observations
of a personal character, or on a call from the Chairman; provided
that the mover of a motion shall be entitled to reply, but shall
not introduce new matter; and any Vestrymen having proposed or
seconded a motion or amendment, shall be considered as having
spoken thereon.

18.  The Chairman shall enforce such of the Bye Laws as
may be necessary for the preservation of order, and his decision

19.  All questions (except where voting by ballot is
provided) shall be determined by show of hands, or division, if
demanded.

20.  When a division is demanded, the Chairman shall

the negative to the left; and shall appoint four Vestrymen as
tellers—two from each side of the question.

21.  Printed lists of the names of the Vestrymen, in
alphabetical order, shall be provided for the tellers, two of
whom (one from the “Noes” and one from the
“Ayes”) shall tell from each side of the question, by
marking off on such lists the names of the Vestrymen on such
side, who are to pass between the tellers respectively for that
purpose.

22.  No Committee shall be appointed except by motion
after due notice; and whenever the Vestry shall have resolved to
appoint a Committee the names of the Members of such Committee
shall be proposed by the mover of the Committee; provided that
any other Vestrymen may thereupon move the addition, omission, or
substitution of any Vestryman or Vestrymen as a member or members
of such Committee.

23.  The election of all paid officers shall be by
ballot; and no candidate shall be eligible for election unless he
shall have been proposed and seconded by Members of the Vestry;
nor shall there be more than one ballot for the same office.

24.  Such ballot shall be by means of folding Balloting
Papers, containing the name or (if there be more than one
appointment of the same description) names of the candidate or
candidates voted for, which papers shall be handed, by the
Vestrymen voting, to the Chairman, or to some person deputed by
him, and deposited in a balloting box by the Chairman, or such
person who shall count the balloting papers, and state to the
Board the number of them.

25.  Any member of the Vestry objecting to a motion of
which notice has not been given, or to the immediate
consideration of a report brought up by a Committee, may require
the same to be placed on the paper for discussion at the next
meeting, unless the Vestry Clerk or Surveyor shall state that the
subject is urgent, in which case the Board shall determine, by a
show of hands, whether the same shall be immediately
considered.

26.  The public are to have access to all books and
minutes of the Vestry, between the hours of 2 and 4 daily; and as
soon as adequate accommodation can be provided, the meetings of
the Vestry shall be open to the ratepayers of the Parish; and it
shall be lawful for all members of the Vestry to attend the
Meetings of Committees, but not to take part in their
proceedings.

140
27.  Special Meetings for revoking and altering
resolutions and acts of the Vestry, as required by the 57th
Section, are to be convened on a requisition to the Clerk, signed
by seven members of the Vestry; but no such Meeting shall be held
unless seven day’s notice thereof shall be given, by notice
given to, or sent by post to, or delivered at, the usual place of
abode of each Vestryman, which notice shall state the time and
place of meeting, and shall specify the object thereof; and no
business shall be transacted at any Special Meeting, except such
as is stated in the notice thereof.

28.  In the event of any urgent business requiring in the
opinion of the Clerk an earlier meeting of the Vestry than would
take place under the above (27th) Bye-Law, it shall be his duty
to call such meeting, giving three day’s notice; or if he
shall receive a written requisition, signed by five members,
stating the object for which they wish such meeting to be
convened, it shall be equally his duty to call such meeting, at
three day’s notice, out of the usual course, but no subject
shall be discussed at such meeting, except the one stated in the
requisition.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

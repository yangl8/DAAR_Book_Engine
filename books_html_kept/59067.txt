DANCING WITHOUT
AN INSTRUCTOR.

INTRODUCTION.

Time was when to be a dancer meant a thorough acquaintance
with Mazourkas, Galops, Reels, Minuets,
Polkas and other dances too numerous to mention; but
nowadays one can get along very well with even a slight
knowledge of but three: the Waltz, the Two-Step and
the Lancers.

It is a pity that such should be the case; but the fact
remains the same; and the beginner must not be dismayed
by glancing through these pages, for but few of the
dances here described ever appear on a ball program.

Special attention must, then, be given to these three
dances, and no great difficulty should be found in learning
the steps.

Dancing properly so-called, is the active exertion of the

10

body in sprightly, graceful movement, accompanied with
exhilaration of the mind, and when indulged in by the
young is a most beneficial and healthful recreation.

It is no argument against dancing in itself, that it is
so often connected with many things that are injurious,
such as heated room, late hours and the like, these belong
to other considerations; but as an exercise, congenial both
to the minds and the physical requirements of the young,
it is like every exercise in which the mind enters with
pleasure and interest into the exercise of the body, a
most efficient promoter of health, and it is much to be
regretted that its abuse and associations in many instances,
both with physical and moral evil, should cause
its abandonment in any place where there are young
people.

11

THE ETIQUETTE OF THE BALLROOM.

Before giving a description of the various dances, a hint
or two as to the etiquette of the ballroom may be found
useful.

In the case of a private dance, the guests, on entering
the ballroom, must seek out the hostess and pay their respects
to her and those who may be assisting her in receiving.

If it is a public ball, the gentleman conducts his partner
to the ladiesâ dressing room, and then proceeds to the
gentlemenâs dressing room. When ready to descend to
the ballroom, he seeks his partner at the door of the apartment
where he previously left her; or, if a sitting room be
provided in addition to the dressing room, the lady will
meet her partner there. They then enter the ballroom,
and the necessary introductions are made.

An introduction given for the mere purpose of enabling
a lady and gentleman to go through a dance together does
not constitute an acquaintanceship. The lady is at liberty

12

to pass the gentleman in the street the next day without
recognition.

No lady should accept refreshments from a stranger at
a public ball, for she would thereby lay herself under a
pecuniary obligation.

Good taste forbids that a lady should dance too frequently
with the same partner at either a public or private
ball.

Engagements for one dance should not be made while
another dance is in progress.

Never attempt to take a place in a dance which has been
previously engaged.

Withdraw from a private ballroom as quietly as possible.

It is not customary for married persons to dance together
in society.

At the beginning and end of a lancers, the gentleman
bows to his partner, and bows again on conducting her to
a seat. He may stay and chat with her for a few moments.

Should a lady decline your hand for a dance, and afterward
dance with another partner, you will do well to attribute
her error to either forgetfulness or ignorance of
the laws of etiquette.

13

A gentleman conducts his last partner to supper; waits
upon her there, and then re-conducts her to the ballroom.

A gentleman escorting a lady to a party or ball, should
invariably dance the first number with her, or offer to do
so, and afterwards see that she is provided with a partner
whenever she wishes to dance.

A gentleman may, with propriety, ask another gentleman,
whether known to him or not, if he wishes a partner,
then introduce him to his lady acquaintances.

The master of ceremonies is privileged to ask any lady
or gentleman whether they wish to dance, make himself
known, and procure partners for them if they so desire.

14

THE FIVE POSITIONS.

It is a mistake to suppose that the beginner, by learning
the two or three steps necessary for the waltz or two-step,
can dance correctly. There is a beginning in dancing, as
in everything else, and the first thing to learn is how to
stand properly.

This seems absurdly simple at first thought, but, as a
matter of fact, comparatively few persons possess the secret.
Either the arms get in the way, or the legs are awkwardly
bent, or the body is too rigid.

The correct standing position is as follows:

Stand with the heels close together, toes pointing outward.
Now sway the entire body forward a little, so as to
bring the weight on the balls of the feet. The heels should
just touch the floor, but the weight should all be forward.
Allow the arms to swing freely from the shoulder; in fact,
forget that you have arms for the time being. This position
is the key to the various steps that are to follow.

Having learned how to stand correctly, we are now
ready to study what are known as âthe five positions.â

15

These positions embrace the various steps used in all
dances, and must be mastered.

The First Position.

âThe first position,â so called, is in reality the standing
position just described, and when practicing the subsequent
positions, it is essential that the student always begin with
this. Remember that all-important detail: weight forward,
heels just touching the floor. (
See Fig. 1
.)

FIGURE 1.

The Second Position.

In the second position we change the V-shape of the
feet by sliding the right foot to the side, in a line with
the body, bending the left knee slightly. The weight will,
of course, be transferred to the left foot. (
See Fig. 2
.)

16

FIGURE 2.

Repeat this movement by sliding the left foot sideways,
transferring the weight to the right foot.

The Third Position.

FIGURE 3.

Again taking the standing position, with toes pointing
outward, the right foot is swung in a small circle to the

17

right and brought behind the left foot, the hollow of the
right foot pressing close against the heel of the left foot.
At the beginning of this movement the weight is thrown on
the ball of the left foot.

Repeat by transferring the weight to the right foot, and
swinging the left foot to the rear. (
See Fig. 3
.)

The Fourth Position.

FIGURE 4.

In the fourth position, throw the weight on the left foot
and slide the right foot forward and a little to the side.
At the end of the slide, the right foot should be in a direct
line with the hollow of the left foot, so that if brought back
it should fit into the hollow, as in the third position. This,

18

however, is only to test the accuracy of the step. After
the slide, the foot should be returned to standing position
and the movement repeated with the other foot. (
See
Fig. 4
.)

Instead of sliding, the foot can be raised from the floor
and placed in the position indicated. In this case, remember
to keep the toe well pointed downward, and do not
raise the foot farther from the floor than is necessary.

There is a variation of this position which will be found
useful in two-step and half-time dancing. This is to slide
the right foot to the rear and slightly outward after completing
the forward movement.

The Fifth Position.

FIGURE 5.

Standing with the heels together, allow the weight to
fall on the ball of the left foot, and move the right foot

19

forward until the heel of that foot is at the side of the
toe of the other foot. The feet should form a right angle.
(
See Fig. 5
.)

Repeat with the left foot, transferring the weight to the
right foot.

These positions are very important and should be practiced
until they can be performed with perfect ease. They
can be alternated at will. For instance, the fifth position
may follow the first, and so on.

20

THE TWO-STEP SLIDE.

Of recent years the two-step has become one of the
most popular dances, and it is one of the simplest.

The method of practicing the step is as follows:

Standing in the first position, slide the right foot to the
side. Bring the left foot alongside, and instantly repeat
the sliding movement with the right foot, only do not make
the slide quite so long as in the first instance.

Now slide to the left with the left foot, bring the right
foot alongside, and continue the slide with the left foot.

At the beginning of the movement the weight is borne
by the left foot, while the right foot slides to the side.
Then the weight is taken by the right foot, while the left
foot is brought into position. At this point the weight
must be transferred instantly to the left foot, and the right
foot shot out quickly to the other side.

It may help the beginner to call out the words: âSlide
and slide,â when practicing this step. Thus:

Slide
: Right foot to the side.

21

And
: Bring up left foot. Both feet together. Transfer
weight to left foot.

Slide
: Right foot to the side. Half the length of the
first slide.

And continue the movement with the other foot, thus:

Slide
: Left foot to the side.

And
: Bring up right foot. Both feet together. Transfer
weight to right foot.

Slide
: Left foot to the side. Half the length of first
slide.

When dancing the two-step, never hop. Always slide
the feet. Keep the weight on the balls of the feet; this
makes the sliding much easier and destroys the tendency
to hop.

22

THE GRAND MARCH.

The Grand March is a feature of all formal balls. It
generally marks the beginning of the eveningâs festivities,
but may, for special reasons, be deferred to a later point
in the programme. In order to make the march an agreeable
feature of the eveningâs pleasures, it should be led
off by a gentleman and lady who understand the details
of the necessary evolutions, assisted, in case of necessity,
by one or more of the floor committee, whose services
may be called upon to preserve uniformity of action
through the march. All marching should be done in
straight lines, following the direction of the walls of the
rooms, the change of direction being made precisely at
each corner. The leader and his partner should lead the
march; moving slowly once or twice round the room,
to give all the couples time to fall in and follow.

THE MARCH IN FILE.

As soon as all are in order the leader should head the
line of march up the middle of the room; when he has

23

reached the top, he turns to the left, and his partner to the
right; the gentlemen all follow him in single file, the
ladies following the leading lady in the same manner;
when the leaders of the two lines arrive at the bottom,
they pass to the left of each other, the gentlemen marching
round the room on the outside, and the ladies inside
them, and in the opposite direction. When the first gentleman
meets his partner again at the top of the room, they
both march together again round the room to the right,
followed by the other couples in their order. The leader
should be careful to introduce sufficient plain marching
between each figure to get all the couples following him
in column before commencing a new evolution.

24

THE MARCH IN COLUMN.

The first couple lead round the room until the leader
reaches the bottom left-hand corner. There, instead of
turning upwards at right angles up the side of the room,
the first couple should file to the right and march in a line
parallel with the advancing couples, but in an opposite
direction across the room; as each couple successively arrives
at the same corner, they file to the right and follow
their leader. When the leader has got across the room,
the first couple should file to the left, and march straight
across back again, and so on, forming a serpentine line
of march backwards and forwards across the room until
the top of the room is reached. To make this effective,
it requires a considerable number of couples, so that there
will be at least four lines, constantly passing each other
in opposite directions, and forming a very pleasing appearance.
When the first couple reach the top of the
room, they lead the march round the room again, until
all the couples are following them in regular column.

25

THE MARCH BY PLATOONS.

The first couple lead the march up the center of the
room. As they reach the top, the first couple passes round
to the right; the second couple to the left; the remaining

odd
couples in their order to the right, and the
even

couples following to the left. All thus march down their
side of the room, until they meet in the middle at the
bottom. There they turn up the center again four abreast.
Arriving at the top, the first four wheel round by the
right; the second four wheel round by the left, and so
on alternately, each division marching down its side of
the room. When they meet at the bottom, they advance
up the center again, eight abreast. At the top of the
room the first and third eight wheel to the right, and the
second and fourth wheel to the left, each succeeding
eight wheeling right and left alternately, down the sides
of the room, meeting at bottom, and marching up the
center sixteen abreast, thus forming full lines. At the
top of the room all halt, the first, third, etc. (
odd
) lines

26

face all to the right; the second, fourth, etc. (
even
) lines
all to the left, the gentlemen step up by the side of their
lady partners, and the front line marches off in couples
to the right, the other lines following in their track, in
the same manner as in the March in Columns, and finishing
in the same way laid down in that march.

27

THE ARBOR MARCH.

All the couples march round the room in order. The
first couple join right hands, stop, and raise their hands,
forming an arch. The second couple pass underneath the
arch, the gentleman first, and form another arch; the third
couple pass under both, and also form an arch, and so
on, each couple passing through the arches ahead of them
in turn, until one continuous arch has been formed. The
first couple (now in the rear) then passes through and
out at the front end of the arbor, followed by each rear
couple in succession, until the arches have all disappeared.
If the number of couples is large, the first couple can follow
the last couple at once under the arches, if preferred,
and repeat the arbor continuously as long as may be desired.
The plain march in couples is then resumed, until
the line of march is in regular order again.

28

THE SERPENTINE MARCH.

The serpentine figure is executed in single file. The
leader steps in front of his lady and leads the way up
the center of the room; as each couple turns to go up the
center, each gentleman steps into single line ahead of his
lady, forming by degrees the whole couples into single
file. When the first gentleman reaches the top of the
room, he leads the way to the right entirely round and
round the room, each successive round passing inside the
former, describing a spiral track towards the center of
the room. As soon as the inner coil becomes small, the
leader turns sharp round to the left and retraces his step
between the coils, until he marches between the coils entirely
out of them. He continues his march until all the
coils are unwound, and then each gentleman retires a step
to the left of his lady partner, and the march is continued
in column until all the couples have fallen into regular
order again.

At the conclusion of the march, the leader stops, gives

29

a signal for the music to be changed into a waltz, and leads
off with his partner, followed by the other couples in
succession.

In order to insure success in a Grand March, no gentleman
can be allowed to act as cavalier to two ladies, as
the movements require all to march in couples. The leader
should regulate his pace to suit circumstances, endeavoring
always to keep the line of march unbroken, and the
couples at uniform distances from each other. The
couples, also, must follow exactly in the track of those
before them and of the leader, keeping correct time with
the music.

30

SQUARE DANCES.

Very little knowledge of dancing is needed in order to
take part in square dances. The various figures, however,
must be learned thoroughly, or the attempt to go through
a quadrille will end in disaster.

â¢
Lady
X
Gentleman

The dancers arrange themselves in âsets,â four couples
forming a âset,â all facing the center. The positions are
taken as in the diagram, gentlemen to the left of the
ladies, and forming a square. The couple facing the stage
is called the first couple, and the couple opposite, the second
couple. These are also called the âhead couples.â The
other couples, the third and fourth, are called the âside
couples.â

31

THE PLAIN QUADRILLE.

The Plain Quadrille is usually danced with four couples,
that is, eight dancers; but sometimes a double formation
is used, and four dancers face each other at each side of
the square.

In the Plain Quadrille there are five figures, and eight
bars of music are given to each.

Repeat with sides.

The dance is begun by the couples first addressing each
other, and then addressing the lady or gentleman in the
nearest couple. Thus the gentleman will first bow to his
partner, then to the lady on his left, and the lady will
courtesy first to her partner, then to the gentleman on
her right. During this, eight measures of introductory

32

music are played. Every square dance is begun with
these salutations.

Head Couples Right and Left.
—The first and second
couples join nearest hand and cross over, between
opposite couples. Each gentleman and opposite lady
touch right hands in passing. The gentleman and his
partner join left hands, and the lady moves halfway round.
At the end of this movement each couple will stand in the
opposite ends of the set, occupying the opposite coupleâs
place.

The same movement is repeated in returning to places.

Head Couples Balance.
—Each gentleman crosses
hands with his partner; that is, he extends his left hand
and takes his partnerâs left, and takes his partnerâs right
hand in his right. In taking this position the right hands
should be above the left. With hands crossed thus, the
couple promenade across the set, passing the opposite
couple to the right. Return to places in same manner.

Head Couples Ladiesâ Chain.
—The ladies of first
and second couples cross to opposite gentlemen, touching
right hands as they pass. They offer left hand to opposite
gentlemen, who turn them half round. Ladies return,

33

again touching right hands in passing, and turning partner
with left hand to places.

Head Couples Balance.
—Repeat movement as before.

The entire figure as described above is repeated by the
side couples.

SECOND FIGURE.

Head couples, forward two:—

danced twice by the side couples.

Head Couples Forward Two.
—This includes the four
movements following.

Head Couples Forward and Back.
—Each gentleman
extends right hand to partner and takes ladyâs left hand.
Starting with right foot, he takes four steps forward and
four steps backward.

Cross Over.
—The couples drop hands, and walk
straight across set, ladies passing between gentlemen, but
without touching hands.

Chassez to Partners.
—The partners face each other

34

and take four steps forward to the right, and four steps
backward to the left, passing partners on the right.

Cross to Places.
—Walk to places as before, ladies
passing inside.

This figure is then repeated by head couples, and danced
twice by side couples.

Head Couples Right Hands Across.
—The head
couples cross over and give right hands to opposite dancers
in passing. Ladies pass
between
opposite couple,
and, when doing so, touch the opposite gentlemanâs hand.

Left Hands Back.
—On the return, each gentleman
takes the left hand of the opposite lady in his left. The
hands are retained while passing, then all face the center
and the ladies cross right hands to partners.

Balance in Center.
—The four dancers perform this

35

movement, stepping forward and back, thus: Slide the
right foot to the right, and bring the left foot in front of
the right in third position; count two; slide the left foot to
the left, and bring the right foot in front of the left in the
third position; count two; repeat the above; count four.

Half Promenade.
—All drop left hands, each gentleman
retaining his partnerâs right, and promenade to position
originally occupied by opposite couple.

Two Ladies Forward and Back.
—Two ladies move
forward four steps, and retire four steps.

Two Gentlemen Forward and Back.
—Gentlemen
repeat movement.

Forward Four and Back.
—Gentlemen join hands with
partners and move forward four steps, and retire four
steps.

Half Right and Left.
—Both couples cross over; each
person gives right hand in passing to the opposite person,
and left hand to partner, and turn to places.

FOURTH FIGURE.

time.

Forward Three.
—The first gentleman and two ladies

37

advance four steps, and retire four steps, second gentleman
remaining in place.

Forward Again.
—The first gentleman and two ladies
advance again and meet second gentleman, all joining
hands in a circle.

Four Hands Half Around.
—The four dancers turn
half around to the left, and each couple retires to the place
occupied by opposite couple.

Half Right and Left.
—Head couples cross over, each
lady passing between opposite couple and touching opposite

—Here all the ladies take
four steps forward and retire four steps, then advance
again four steps and join hands in the center, standing
close together.

Gentlemen Forward.
—All the gentlemen advance and
form a circle around the ladies by joining hands.

Gentlemen Hands Around.

around the circle to the left (sixteen steps), and stop when

by the gentlemen sliding around to the left only halfway
(eight steps), and then sliding back to original positions
(eight steps).

Form Basket.
—All the gentlemen raise their arms over
the ladiesâ heads, with hands still joined, and bring them

41

down in front of the ladies. All retain hands, and the

formed, with arms intertwined.

Turn Partners to Places.
—All turn partners and
resume original positions in quadrille.

42

THE NINE-PIN.

This figure is not generally introduced into a regular
quadrille, but is danced separately. It requires an extra
gentleman, who takes his place in the center. The movements
are performed at the will of the leader; forward
four, ladiesâ chain, ladies to the center, right and left all
around, or any other movements being called in succession.
It is preferable to introduce those movements which require
all the dancers, or at least one partner out of each
couple. At an unexpected moment, generally in the middle
of a movement where the gentlemen are separated from
their partners, a signal is given, when each gentleman secures
the nearest lady for a partner, the music stops, and
each lady resumes her place with her new partner; the
gentleman who fails to secure a partner becomes the nine-pin,
and takes his place in the center; the music recommences
and dancing proceeds as before, until another
signal is given. This is repeated at will, generally ending
with all chassez.

instead of resuming positions in quadrille, the head
couples remain facing their respective side couples, and a
âladiesâ chainâ is made on each side of the quadrille by
each two facing couples. There is no objection to this if

78

there be plenty of room, but where limited, it is better to
execute a âladiesâ grand chainâ with the couples at their
places.

95

CONTRA DANCES.

The Contra Dances take their names from the positions
of the dancers, the word
contra
meaning âagainstâ or âopposite
to.â Instead of the partners standing side by side,
they face each other, being arranged in two parallel lines,
ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other.

The Virginia Reel.

This is one of the most lively of all the Contra Dances,
and is a universal favorite. Form in sets of six couples,
the six ladies ranging in line, and their partners ranging in
another line, facing each other; the gentleman and lady of
the head couple standing at the end of their respective lines
at the top of the room. The space between the lines should
be about four feet. The couples, for the sake of description,
may be numerically designated first, second, third,
and so on (in their order as they stand) to the last couple;
the top and bottom couple being that couple which happens
during the dance to occupy the position at top or bottom

96

of the lines. Each couple in turn becomes top couple
and bottom couple at least once during the progress of the
dance.

First Gentleman and Last Lady Forward and
Back.
—The two take four steps directly towards each
other and four steps backward to place, without turning.

First Gentleman and Last Lady Forward and
Swing Right Hands.
—The two dance forward to the
center, join right hands, swing once around, and step
backward to place.

First Gentleman and Last Lady Forward and
Swing With Left Hands.
—Exactly like preceding
movement, only joining left hands instead of right.

First Gentlemen and Last Lady Dos a Dos.
—They
advance to middle, pass each other on right hands, move
around each other to the right, back to back, without turning,
and back, passing to left of each other, to places.

First Couple Turn with Right Hands.
—The first
gentleman and his partner join hands across the head of
lines, turn fully once around, and drop right hands.

Separate and Turn Second Couple.
—The gentleman
joins left hands with second lady, and swings her half
around; at the same time the first lady joins left hands with

97

second gentleman and swings half around; the first gentleman
and his partner meet, facing each other. The first
couple repeat these movements with each other, and each
succeeding couple until they reach the bottom. Then the
first couple join hands and dance up the middle to their
former places at the top. The gentlemen march to the left
and the ladies to the right in line, and come up the middle
to places. The top couple dance down the middle to the
bottom and become bottom couple. Top and bottom couples
begin the figure over again, and continue until the first
couple have reached their places again at the top. Sometimes,
in the march, when the first couple, having marched
down the outside, meet at the bottom of the set, they stop,
join hands and raise their arms, allowing all the other
couples to pass under. This leaves them at the bottom
of the lines.

The calls for the Virginia Reel are as follows:

First gentleman and last lady forward and back.

First lady and last gentleman the same.

First gentleman and last lady swing right hands.

First lady and last gentleman the same.

First gentleman and last lady swing left hands.

First lady and last gentleman the same.

Down the Outside.
—The gentleman turns to the left,
and the lady to the right, outside their respective lines
back again to places.

100

Right Hands Across With Second Lady.
—Head
couple and second lady cross right hands, and swing to
the left.

Three Left Hands Across.
—The three drop right
hands, turn, cross left hands and swing to the right. The
second lady passes quickly under the raised hands of the
first couple, all singing, âPop Goes the Weasel,â to her
place. The head couple repeat the same movement with
the second gentleman, and so on down the set.

As soon as a couple have been âpoppedâ they move up a
step on their respective lines, so as to leave a little space
between themselves and the next couple. The first couple
then repeat the whole figure, turning and âpoppingâ the
next couple, and so continue throughout the set. In passing
outside they do not go to the ends of the lines, but pass
between the couples whom they have âpoppedâ and the
rest of the line. As soon as the first couple have turned
and âpoppedâ two or three couples, the second couple
also starts, and as many couples are kept in lively motion
as can dance without confusion.

101

SPANISH DANCE.

The dance can be performed by any number of couples
arranged in a complete circle, each alternate couple facing
the opposite way to the rest. This produces a series of
squares or sets, each consisting of two couples facing one
another.

The same movements are executed in all the sets at
once. The couples in each set have their backs towards
the couples in the adjoining sets. Each set may be regarded
as a little square, the ends of which are occupied
by the two couples, while the sides are vacant.

One set consists of two couples, standing facing one another,
the first gentleman and first lady constituting the
first couple; the second gentleman and second lady the
second couple. The square has four sides—two opposite
two—the two opposite sides now occupied by the couples
will be designated the ends; the two other opposite sides
will be called the sides.

The music is in waltz time, with three beats in a measure.
The calls for the Spanish dance are:

102

each time the dance is performed.

ROUND DANCING.

The Waltz.

In the waltz the partners stand facing each other, the
gentleman a little to the right, encircling the ladyâs waist
with his right arm, supporting her firmly, yet gently, and
holding her right hand with his left, extending it nearly to
the height of his waist, the left arm being only slightly
bent at the elbow.

The ladyâs left hand should rest lightly upon her partnerâs
right shoulder, while the right arm should be extended
nearly straight, with the palm of her hand turned
downward. The gentleman then places the inner side of
the fingers of his left hand against the inner side of the
fingers of the ladyâs right hand. It is the duty of the gentleman
to guide his partner in the dance, and he should
hold her with sufficient firmness to make this guidance unmistakable,
but by no means so closely as to interfere with
absolute freedom of movement. The lady should yield entirely
to her partnerâs guidance. Unnecessarily close personal

105

contact should be, strictly avoided, both because it is
unrefined and because it leads, inevitably, to awkwardness
in posture and movement. The lady should not lean upon
her partner. He is not supposed to sustain any portion of
her weight. The gentleman should adapt his step to that of
the lady, and especially guard against taking too long
steps.

In all the round dances, the lady commences with the
right foot and the gentleman with the left. Both dancers
should look to the front, over one anotherâs shoulders.

In the modern style of waltzing, four bars or twelve
beats may be occupied in completing one entire turn. This
renders it equally easy to turn forward or reverse, or, in
fact, in any direction that the fancy may suggest or circumstances—a
crowded room, for instance—may demand.

The main distinction between the old and new style may
be concisely summed up as follows: In the old style, the
slide of the left foot in beat one, and the right in beat four,
is sideways and partially turning at the same time; in the
new style, the glide of the left foot in beat one is exactly
backward, and that of the right in beat four is exactly forward
in a straight line, without a âshadow of turning,â

106

the turn being confined solely to beats two, three, and five,
six.

Waltz music contains three beats in a measure, the first
of the three being accented. The waltz step consists of six
movements, one to each beat of the music, thus occupying
two measures. The rhythm of the step corresponds to the
rhythm of the music. Thus the first and fourth movements
are accented.

The following are the various steps for the gentlemen,
but the ladies have the same steps, though they begin with
the fourth step and right foot, and continue with the fifth
and sixth, and go on to the first without changing; thus
the gentleman is executing one, two, three, while the lady
executes four, five, six; this continues without variation
throughout the waltz.

FIRST STEP.

Take the third position, right foot in front. Glide the
left foot directly backward about twelve inches (fourth
position).

SECOND STEP.

Pass the right foot two or three inches behind the left
heel, at the same time turning on the ball of each foot
count two.

107

THIRD STEP.

Complete the turn by bringing the right foot front in the
third position; count three.

FOURTH STEP.

Glide the right foot directly forward about twelve inches
(fourth position); count four.

FIFTH STEP.

Advance the left foot about six inches in front of the
right, at the same time turning on the ball of each foot;
count five.

SIXTH STEP.

Complete the turn by bringing the right foot in front in
the third position; count six.

THE REVERSE.

The movement in the reverse direction is effected by
substituting the left foot for the right foot in the foregoing
explanation. The left foot is glided directly forward at
the fourth step, instead of the right; and the right foot
glides directly backward at the first step, instead of the
left.

108

THE GLIDE WALTZ.

The following are the six steps in the Glide Waltz:

FIRST STEP.

Step straight backward with the left foot to fourth position;
count one.

SECOND STEP.

Draw right foot to the left, to first position; count two.

THIRD STEP.

Step slightly backward to nearly third position; count
three, making quarter turn.

FOURTH STEP.

Step straight forward with the right foot to fourth
position; count four.

FIFTH STEP.

Draw left foot to right in first position; count five.

SIXTH STEP.

Step slightly forward with right foot toward third position,
making quarter turn; count six.

109

THE TWO-STEP.

Of recent years the Two-step has become very popular.
It is similar to the Galop, its characteristic feature consisting
in a difference of accentuation. The movements
of the Two-step occur and are counted on the first
and third beats of the bar, a pause being made on the
second beat, thus—one and two.

The steps for the gentlemen are as follows:

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left foot sideways to the left, bringing the
right foot behind, close up to the left, in the third position;
count one.

SECOND STEP.

Slide the left foot diagonally forward, turning half
round on the left foot, and bringing the right foot, toe
pointing to the floor, behind and close up to the ankle of the
left foot; count two.

The same is now repeated with the right foot, using each
foot alternately to commence the step. The couples may

110

dance forward or backward, turning either to the right or
left, as inclination may direct; or they may make the movement
in a straight line. In the latter case, the gentleman
straightens his arm, placing the lady a little more to his
right. He then slides backward, making the steps in the
same manner as described, without turning, the lady, of
course, moving forward simultaneously.

111

THE GALOP.

This step is very simple, and consists of but two movements.
The music is in 2-4 time, and as a rule, played
quickly. There are two kinds of steps used—one for going
forward and the other for turning round. The forward
movement is a perfectly natural one, and will be easily
understood. The turning movement is accomplished by
using the ordinary waltz step, counting one and two, one
and two, letting the second and fifth steps come in at the
word âand.â

Position.—Right foot in front.

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left foot straight to the side with a gentle
spring on the right, allowing the weight to rest on the
left foot.

SECOND STEP.

Bring right foot up to the left, with a light spring on
left.

Repeat three times, making in all four slides to the right.

112

Accent the slides, and give as little time as possible to the
change. The fourth time, instead of transferring the
weight to the left foot, pivot on the right foot, making a
half turn to the right. Then take four slides, with the left
foot leading. Pivot to the right on the left foot, and repeat,
with the right foot again leading.

THE POLKA.

The Polka is in 2-4 time, and consists of three steps and
one rest. At the beginning, the gentleman slides right foot
forward to the right, and brings the left foot to the side of
the right ankle.

Continue thus:

FIRST STEP.

Spring on the right foot, and at the same time slide the
left foot forward.

SECOND STEP.

Bring the right foot up close behind the left and transfer
weight to left foot.

THIRD STEP.

Slide the left foot forward, as in the first step.

FOURTH STEP.

Spring on the left foot, and at the same time turn
half around, bringing the right foot up behind, slightly
pointed downwards, and close to the ankle of the left.
The three steps to complete the circle are the same

114

as described, but made by commencing with the right foot,
which is the foot the lady commences with. These steps
may be taken forward or backward, and to right or left, by
a slight alteration of the first step.

All the steps should be made entirely on the toes, and
with elasticity, the knees being slightly bent.

115

THE POLKA MAZOURKA.

The music for this dance is in 3-4 time, and consists of
one Mazourka step and one Polka step, counting three to
each step, six in all. Some years ago the Polka Mazourka
obtained a marked degree of popularity. It is a pleasing
dance for those who enjoy subdued motion, but it was supplanted
in popular favor by a prevailing taste for something
fast. The following are the steps:

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left foot forward to the left; count one.

SECOND STEP.

Bring the right foot up to the left; at the same time
raise the left foot, extending it, pointing the foot down;
count two.

THIRD STEP.

Bring the left foot back close to the right, the toe pointing
downwards and raised from the floor, at the same

116

time springing on the right foot, without touching the
left on the floor; count three.

FOURTH STEP.

Slide the left foot forward; count four.

FIFTH STEP.

Bring the right foot up to where the left was, raising
the left foot in front; count five.

SIXTH STEP.

Face on the left foot, raising the right foot, resting at
the same time, turning halfway round; count six.

Then commence with the right foot as at âfirst,â and
continue.

The first three steps should be taken sideways, partners
facing each other.

117

THE SCHOTTISCHE.

In this dance partners stand side by side and facing the
same way. The gentlemanâs right hand rests lightly on the
ladyâs waist, and her left hand rests on his right shoulder.

The lady starts with the right foot, the gentleman with
the left.

FIRST PART.

This part should be danced by each couple in a direction
towards and from the center of the room.

Following are the steps for the gentlemen:

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left foot sideways.

SECOND STEP.

Draw the right foot up close to the left.

THIRD STEP.

Slide the left foot sideways again.

FOURTH STEP.

Spring on the left foot, and at the same time bring the

118

right behind, raised from the floor, and close to the ankle
of the left foot.

Repeat the same with the right foot, thus:

FIFTH STEP.

Slide the right foot sideways.

SIXTH STEP.

Bring the left foot up close to the right.

SEVENTH STEP.

Slide the right foot sideways again.

EIGHTH STEP.

Spring on the right foot, and at the same time bring
the left behind, raised from the floor, and close to the
ankle of the right foot.

SECOND PART.

The second part is a rotary movement, performed by
hopping on alternate feet, or waltzing twice round. The
steps are as follows:

FIRST STEP.

Spring forward from the right foot to the left, bringing
the right foot, toe pointing to the floor, behind, and
close to the ankle of the left foot.

119

SECOND STEP.

Hop on the left foot, at the same time turning half
around.

THIRD STEP.

Spring from the left to the right foot.

FOURTH STEP.

Hop on the right foot.

CONCLUDING STEPS.

Repeat the same with the other foot, counting five, six,
seven, eight.

120

MILITARY SCHOTTISCHE.

(Or âBarn Dance.â)

The position of partners for the first part (4 bars) is
standing side by side, the ladyâs left hand resting lightly
in the right hand of her partner.

In the second part (4 bars) partners dance together
as in an ordinary round dance.

FIRST PART (4 BARS).

The following are the steps for the first part:

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left foot to fourth position.

SECOND STEP.

With a light spring on the left bring the right foot to
the place of the left, and in so doing point the latter
(slightly raised in front) in the fourth position.

THIRD STEP.

Spring forward on the left foot, raising the right behind.

121

FOURTH STEP.

Make a slight hop on the sole of the left foot, and extend
the right in front with toe pointed downwards.

Repeat the movement, commencing with the right foot
(the foot the lady commences with). The two movements
are again repeated to complete the first four bars.

SECOND PART (4 BARS).

Holding, as in an ordinary round dance, the couple
waltz four bars as explained in the Schottische.

122

THE HIGHLAND SCHOTTISCHE.

This dance differs from the original Schottische in the
introduction of motions (steps) taken from the Highland
Fling; also in the length of the two phrases, which are
extended to four bars each, instead of two. During the
first phrase of four bars, while dancing the Highland
Fling steps, the dancers do not take hands, but remain
face to face. Those who are familiar with all the movements
of the Fling raise one hand above the head, while
resting the other upon the hip, as it is done when dancing
that active dance.

Great latitude is taken at this part of the dance, as any
steps (motions) belonging to the Fling may be introduced.

Like the Barn Dance, it occupies 8 bars of music, and
is divided into two parts of 4 bars each.

In order to perform the first part, the couples should
face each other at a very short distance, both commencing

123

with the right foot, the left arms raised above the head
and the right arms akimbo.

FIRST PART.

Following are the steps for the first part:

FIRST STEP.

Spring upwards from both feet and alight on the left
foot (toes) with the right foot pointed in the second position.

SECOND STEP.

Hop on the left and simultaneously bring the right behind
the left.

THIRD STEP.

Repeat the first step exactly as first performed.

FOURTH STEP.

Repeat the second step, but instead of bringing the right
foot behind, let it pass in front.

CONCLUDING STEPS.

Schottische step to right.

In the last four steps the dancers pass away from each
other.

Repeat the eight steps, beginning with the left foot.

124

The last four steps should bring the dancers opposite
each other again.

SECOND PART.

Link right arms, each raising the left, place the right
foot down and hop, counting one, two, then place left
foot down and hop, counting three, four; repeat, counting
one, two, three, four; while doing this, begin to move
forward and round each other. During the last hop release
the partnerâs right arm and link left, now raise the
right and make a corresponding tour in the reverse direction
with the same steps.

In finishing the last hop, separate from your partner and
commence the first movement by pointing the right foot,
with a slight hop on the left.

125

THE RACQUET.

FIRST PART.

The music for the Racquet is in 3-4 time. No full turn
is made; the dance consists of but two long slides, taken
in every possible direction. On the first accented beat take
two long Galop slides with the left foot, and as the right
foot is brought alongside, pause a moment and raise left
foot slightly from the floor. Then continue by sliding forward
twice with right foot, the first slide always being
taken on the first, or accented beat in the measure.

Hop forward again on the left foot, release ladyâs
hand, turn around, gentleman takes ladyâs right hand in
his left. The movements are then repeated, facing in the
opposite direction.

SECOND PART.

The couples then take positions as in the waltz and
dance the polka or two-step for four measures, after which
they again join hands and advance as before.

126

LA BOHEMIENNE.

The music for La Bohemienne, or the Heel-and-Toe
Polka, as it is popularly termed, is in 2-4 time. It is
danced as follows:

FIRST STEP.

Place left heel on the floor in second position, resting on
right foot, count one; bring the toe of left foot behind the
right, count two; and take full polka step, count one,
two, three.

SECOND STEP.

Place the right heel on the floor, resting on left foot,
count one; bring the toe of right foot behind the left,
count two; then take full polka step, count one, two, three.

The Heel-and-Toe and the Plain Polka are alternated
throughout the dance.

127

THE BERLIN.

The music for the Berlin is in polka time, two beats in a
measure. It is composed of two parts.

The partners stand side by side, the gentleman taking
the ladyâs left hand in his right. Both dance in same
direction. Both start together, gentlemen beginning with
left foot, ladies with the right.

FIRST PART.

The following steps are for gentlemen. Ladies substitute
ârightâ for âleft.â

FIRST STEP.

Slide the left forward and bring hollow of right foot
to heel of left foot, transferring the weight to ball of
right foot, the heel being raised slightly from the floor.

SECOND STEP.

Throw the left foot forward, carrying the weight of
the body with it, raising the right foot, with toe pointing
downward.

128

THIRD STEP.

Hop forward on the left foot.

FOURTH STEP.

Hop again on the right foot, turn half round (lady to
left, gentleman to right), change hands and bring the
left foot, raised, to third position behind the right (4).

SECOND PART.

Repeat the above, moving now in the opposite direction
from that in which the start was made.

At the end of the fourth measure (eight counts), take
waltz position and dance the two-step for four measures,
alternating thus throughout the dance.

129

THE YORKE.

The Yorke is an evolution of the old polka mazourka,
and introduces a mazourka movement at pleasure.

The lady slides right foot about twenty inches to the
side in second position count 1, bring left to right (change)
and almost simultaneously slide right foot to side, count
and 2; draw left foot to first position (change), thereby
placing the weight on the left foot and raise the right
foot from the floor, toe pointed 3. The first three movements
are all made to the side without turning—one bar
of music.

Hop lightly on the left foot and place the weight on the
right foot, sliding it sideways and forward about 6 inches
(hop slide), count 1; draw left to right foot in first position
(change) count 2; leap from left to right foot, count
3; slide the left foot round to position to commence the
sideways movement with that foot, count 1. Repeat, with
opposite foot, making the leap in the 4th bar a leap backward

130

as in the waltz. In order to give the mazurka effect,
one must strike the heels together, although it is not
necessary, and to be graceful in this dance, special attention
must be paid to the hop slide.

131

THE CAPRICE.

This is a popular variation of the waltz, and is danced
to the same music. Eight measures are required for a
single execution of the movements. The steps in the first
four measures are taken straight to the side. A half turn
is made in the fifth measure, in which the plain waltz step
is used; also in the sixth, and again on the first two counts
of the seventh measure. The last two slides are also made
to the side.

132

THE REDOWA.

This is a very graceful, attractive dance, and performed
in the same time as the Polka-Mazourka,
i. e.
, three-four
time.

When first introduced it was customary to begin with
a promenade movement, but is now generally commenced
with the circular figure. The original style of this dance
is almost lost, a kind of elongated polka step being substituted
for it. No one who is really acquainted with the
original method would ever commit this error.

Position.—Third, right foot in front.

FIRST STEP.

Spring onto the left foot into the second position, turning
half round and well bending the knee; the right foot
meanwhile being drawn up close in front over the instep
of the left, gliding it along the floor in the second position.

SECOND STEP.

Transfer the weight of the body to the right foot.

133

THIRD STEP.

Draw up left foot into fifth position behind, and rest
the weight onto it, raising the right foot slightly in
front.

FOURTH STEP.

Spring onto the right foot in fourth position with bended
knee; then turn half round, at the same time bringing the
left foot close up behind the right, and slide the left foot
into second position.

FIFTH STEP.

Transfer the whole weight of the body to the left.

SIXTH STEP.

Draw up your right foot into the fifth position in front,
and rest the weight thereon.

134

THE VARSOVIANA.

The Varsoviana was a very simple, easy dance, but
such unwarrantable liberties were taken with it, and so
vulgarly was it performed by the mass, that its existence
was very brief, and is now only thought of as a thing
of the past.

The first step was, in fact, nothing but the polka with
the knee well bent on the jette, or third movement, turning
half round, the opposite foot being slightly raised behind
in fifth position; this occupies 1 bar. At 4 (the commencement
of the second bar), the bent knee is gradually
straightened (without any jerk), and the other foot at
the same time being gracefully slid into the second position,
the toe being extensively pointed, and the head and
body inclining towards it, passing in that position till the
remainder of the bar is finished.

The same step is again performed with the right foot,
and continued alternately for 16 bars, each step requiring
2 bars of music for its completion.

135

The first movement is repeated eight times. The second
step consists of the first part of the polka-mazourka
(where the beat behind occurs). This is done twice, occupying
2 bars of music, and is followed by one step of the
first movement, requiring 2 more bars.

This step, as well as the third, requiring 4 bars for its
completion, is only performed four times. The first movement
being repeated after each of them.

The third part, sometimes called Redowa, is in reality
nothing but the first step danced three times, before pointing
the foot in second position, pausing; or, in other
words, it is the polka movement danced with a bent knee
three times successively before pointing the opposite foot.

136

HALF-TIME DANCING.

A recent fad which has become popular in certain
dancing circles is the Half Time. This is merely a curtailment
of the number of steps in the dance, with a pause
to fill out the measure.

The positions are similar to those in the ordinary waltz
and two-step except that the lady is placed a little more to
the gentlemanâs right.

In half-time waltzing only two steps are taken instead
of three; the couples pausing for the third beat in the
measure. The gentleman leads backward with the right
foot, count one; simultaneously the lady advances with
the right at the side of the gentlemanâs right. The gentleman
slides the left foot alongside his right, the lady
executing the same movement, count two; pause in this
position, count three. The same movements are repeated.

137

THE COTILLION.

The Cotillion, or German, is one of the most social of
dances, and is deservedly popular. It may be composed of
any number of couples; but in a large party of twenty-four
couples or more, it is better for the leader to seat
himself in the center, and to select the dancers from each
end of the circle alternately; this shortens the dance, and
prevents it from becoming tedious.

Should the ladies be in the minority, the gentlemen who
are without partners are always permitted to engage any
of the ladies for a single figure without any formal introduction.
Where ladies are without escorts, they are generally
under the special care of the leader, who either
dances with them himself, or presents them to some of the
gentlemen.

While it is absolutely necessary that all authority in
regard to the cotillion should be placed in a single individual,
it is also necessary that the ladies and gentlemen
who compose the set should render to the leader all possible

138

assistance in carrying out his orders, or rather suggestions.

To be a successful leader requires a combination of tact,
patience, courtesy, vivacity and common sense. He must
know exactly what program is to be carried out, and
arrange all the details beforehand, so that there may be no
delay or confusion.

It is his place to call the different dancers to the floor,
and to see to it that no one is neglected, but that, so far as
possible, all have an equal chance to enjoy themselves.

He signals to the musicians when the music is to begin,
to stop, or to change to a different rhythm, and to the
dancers when they are to stop dancing and to return to
their seats.

These signals are given by clapping the hands, or by
blowing a whistle, the latter being the favorite method.

Castanets are sometimes used for the same purpose.
The figures to be danced should be selected with reference
to the space available for dancing and the number of guests
participating.

When it is time for the dance to begin, the leaderâs first
duty is to seat the dancers. This is generally done by lot.
The chairs are numbered in pairs. Each couple draws a

139

card, also numbered, and seat themselves in the chairs
whose number corresponds to the number on the card.
There should be an equal number of ladies and gentlemen
participating. But, in case there are any of either sex
who have no partners, they are seated at the end of the
line, and the leader will see that they receive a due share
of attention from the others. Favors are used in many
of the figures. These generally consist of little trifles
made of bright-colored ribbons, tissue paper, tinsel, etc.
They may be as inexpensive or as elegant as the taste and
means of the hostess permit. Cut flowers may also be
used. Those favors are most popular which can be pinned
to the coat or dress and worn as decorations throughout
the evening. Two tables are provided, one for the gentlemenâs
favors and one for those designed for the ladies.
The leader may distribute the favors himself, but it is
more customary to invite some lady to preside over each
table. Favors may be used in any figure, and
should
be
used in at least every other one.

When all are seated, the leader, as briefly and clearly
as possible, explains the figure to be danced, and calls the
requisite number of dancers to the floor, beginning at the
head of the line. The couples thus designated dance once

140

around the room and then perform the figure as directed,
which is repeated until all have danced. The leader
should be constantly on the floor, directing and assisting
where it is necessary to do so.

At the conclusion of the dance, the leader generally
stands with the hostess to receive the adieux of the guests,
an honor certainly due to the one upon whom the success
of the evening chiefly depends.

It is the duty of the guests to cordially second the efforts
of the leader. The closest attention should be given
when he is explaining a figure, and all should be ready to
enter into it with heartiness and animation. It is in bad
taste for any couple to get up and dance on their own account,
regardless of the figure which is being executed.
It would seem as if this caution should be unnecessary,
but, unfortunately, observation proves that even among
well-bred people there are occasionally some who are
thoughtless enough to offend in this way. In such cases
the leader is fully justified in stopping the music and kindly
but decidedly requesting the intruders to return to their
seats.

141

THE FIGURES OF THE COTILLION.

1.—THE FLOWER FIGURE.

Seat a lady in center of room with flowers placed loosely
on a tray. One couple waltz at signal, each take a flower
and favor some one with whom they dance. Repeat this
until by changes the thirty-two persons are up. Signal,
form circle, grand right and left, waltz. Another lady will
then be left. She takes her seat in the vacated chair, and
the dancers in waltzing around, throw the flowers in her
lap, with which she makes a bouquet. The leader then appoints
a gentleman to waltz with the lady or waltzes with
her himself.

2.—THE MAGIC HAT.

The gentleman leaves his partner in the middle of the
room, and gives her a hat. All the gentlemen form a circle
round the lady, turning their backs to her, circle rapidly
to the left. The lady places the hat on the head of one of
the gentlemen, with whom she dances. The other gentlemen
return to seats.

142

3.—THE SCARF.

First couple leads off. The leader stands in center of
room holding scarf; his partner, with all of the other ladies,
form a circle around him and turn rapidly to the left; the
leader tries to throw scarf over the shoulder of one of the
ladies, and dances with her. Other ladies retire to seats.

4.—FOLLOW MY LEADER.

All the couples form in column behind the first. The
head couple waltz in a zigzag course in and out between
the other couples, and stop at the end of the line about
three feet behind the last couple. As soon as the first
couple have danced past two of the other couples, the
second couple also starts, and this is continued until all
have danced the zigzag waltz, at which point the first
couple will again be at the head of the column. All then
waltz to seats.

5.—PING PONG.

The leader selects five ladies, and his partner selects six
gentlemen. Leader and his partner hold sheet for net.
Ladies on one side, gentlemen on the other. Ladies bat ball
over the sheet in rotation; the gentleman catching the ball
will step around the net and waltz with the lady who served
the ball.

143

6.—THE TOAST.

Three chairs are set on a line, the center one being placed
in a direction opposite to the other two. The leader places
his lady upon the center chair, gives her a glass of wine,
and brings forward two gentlemen, whom he seats on the
two other chairs. The lady hands the glass of wine to one
of the gentlemen to âtoastâ her health, and dances with
the other gentleman.

7.—THE UMBRELLA.

The leaderâs partner takes an umbrella, opens it, and
hands it to any gentleman in the circle. The gentleman
with the umbrella will hold it up and walk around the circle
until some lady takes him out of the rain by arising and
waltzing once around with him. The lady then hands umbrella
to another gentleman in the circle, who in turn walks
around until relieved.

8.—THE SIGNAL OF DISTRESS.

A tin horn is placed in center of circle. The leader selects
one gentleman and requests him to take the horn and
walk around blowing it until one of the ladies relieves him.
She dances with him, then hands the tin horn to a gentleman
she may select from the circle.

144

9.—THE CHAIR.

The leader places a chair in the center of the room, and
upon it seats his partner, to whom he next presents two
gentlemen. The lady dances with one of the gentlemen,
and the other gentleman seats himself in the chair just vacated
by the lady. The leader then presents to the gentleman
two ladies; he dances with one of them, and the
other takes the chair.

10.—FORFEITS.

The leader hands his lady a hat or basket, with which
she proceeds to receive forfeits from the other ladies present,
such as rings, handkerchiefs, fans, etc.; she then takes
the hat or basket around to the gentlemen, who each select,
at random, one of the articles, and dance with the lady
owning it.

11.—PUSS IN THE CORNER.

Four chairs are placed in the center of the room, separated
so as to make four corners. The leader places his
partner upon one of the chairs, and brings forward three
ladies and places them upon the three remaining chairs,
and takes up a position in the center. The ladies then endeavor
to change seats, using the two-step when passing
from one chair to another; when the gentleman can seize a

145

chair left vacant by the movement of the ladies, he dances
with the lady who is deposed. The next gentleman places
himself in the center and another lady takes the vacant
chair.

12.—THREAD-THE-NEEDLE ARCHWAY.

The first lady selects another lady, and the two stand in
the center of the room with their hands joined and raised as
high as possible. The gentleman then calls up other gentlemen,
who pass under in couples, until two are accepted
as partners by the two ladies, who lower their arms, thus
capturing the favored ones. The rejected gentlemen either
seek other partners or return to seats.

13.—THE KNEELING KNIGHT.

The first gentleman presents to his lady a cushion, which
she offers to several gentlemen, inviting them to kneel upon
it. She may cheat the gentlemen or bestow the cushion at
will. She withdraws it from those she desires to cheat, and
places it before the gentleman with whom she desires to
dance.

14.—THE MASK.

The gentlemen mask themselves. They then arrange
themselves behind a screen, and raise their heads above it.
The ladies then select partners from the group, and waltz.

146

The gentlemen keep their masks on until the finish. Repeated
by the others.

15.—BLIND MANâS BUFF.

Three chairs are placed in the center of the room. First
couple lead off. The conductor takes another gentleman,
whom he blindfolds and seats on the center chair. The
lady selects another gentleman, whom she leads (walking
on tiptoe) to one of the chairs next to the âblindâ man,
while she seats herself on the other chair. The first gentleman
then asks the blindfolded man with whom he will
dance, the person on his right or the one on his left? If
fortunate enough to select the lady, he dances with her.
If he indicates the gentleman, he must waltz with him,
while the lady dances with her partner.

16.—THE AUCTION.

The leader selects a gentleman and places him on a chair
in the center of the room, and proceeds either to auction
him off himself, or selects a good humorist from the circle
to play âauctioneer.â The ladies must then enter into a
spirited competition, and the one offering the highest bid
dances with him. The auctioneering is continued until
all the gentlemen have been âsold.â

147

17.—THE GAY DECEIVER.

The first gentleman leads his lady by the hand round
the circle, and approaches several ladies, feigning to solicit
them to dance. The moment the lady rises to accept him,
he suddenly turns round and addresses another, and plays
the same game till he has made his selection. The first
lady dances with the partner of the lady on whom the
choice has fallen.

18.—THE ROPE.

Three gentlemen choose partners, and their partners select
other gentlemen. The ladies retire to one end of the
room and the gentlemen to the other, while the leader and
his partner stretch a rope across the room, over which the
gentlemen must jump to regain their partners. As the
rope is managed so as to trip the gentlemen as much as
possible, a great deal of amusement is afforded.

19.—THE FAN.

The leader places his lady in the center of the room, and
gives her a fan. He then presents two gentlemen to her.
She presents the fan to one and dances with the other.
The gentleman receiving the fan hops around and fans
the couple while they waltz.

148

20.—THE BASKET, RING AND FLOWER.

The first couple advance. The gentleman gives to his
partner a basket containing a flower and a ring. He then
presents to her three gentlemen. To one she gives the
flower, to another the ring, and to the third the basket.
The gentleman who receives the basket must dance alone,
holding the basket in his hand; the one who has the ring
may choose a lady to dance with him, and the one who has
the flower dances with the lady who presented it to him.
When they have danced around the room two or three
times they all resume seats, and the next couple do same
until end of circle.

21.—THE INSCRIPTIONS.

Several plain cards are prepared; upon one side of each
is a number, and upon the other side a ludicrous inscription;
a gentleman and lady waltz; the lady then takes her
place by the table, upon which are the cards; the gentleman
presents a basket containing corresponding numbers
with those on the cards to another gentleman, who after
drawing one presents it to the lady; she then selects the
card having that number, and attaches it to the gentlemanâs
back, with the inscription exposed to view; they
then waltz together.

149

22.—THE BASKET.

Three or four couples waltz; the gentlemen then choose
another lady, and the ladies another gentleman. All join
hands in a circle, and take four steps forward and four
back, again four steps forward, when the gentlemen take
each otherâs hands above and the ladies below, as in the
âQuadrille Basket.â Then all balance in place; the leader
then drops the hand of the gentleman on his left, and his
partner drops the hand of the lady on her right, then all
array themselves in a straight line. The gentlemen then
lift their arms and disengage the ladies, who pass under
and waltz forward, followed by the gentlemen. At a
signal, the ladies turn round and dance with the opposite
gentlemen.

23.—THE INCONSTANTS.

The first four couples waltz and then range themselves
in a column, the first couple at the head. The first gentleman
turns round and gives the left arm, crossed at the
elbow, to the left arm of the gentleman behind him, with
whom he changes place. He continues this movement
until he reaches the front of the column, where he stops.
The second gentleman (now at the head) performs the
same figure, and each of the other gentlemen in turn does

150

the same, until, finally, all have regained their own partners.
Then all dance.

24.—THE COLUMNS.

The conductor leads off with a
tour de valse
, and leaves
his lady in the middle of the room. He takes a gentleman,
whom he places back to back with his partner; he
then brings another lady, whom he places facing the
gentleman, and in the same manner with the others, until
a column of five or six couples is formed, which must
terminate with a lady, the leader himself standing back
to back with the last lady. At a signal by leader, all
turn about and waltz with his or her
vis-Ã -vis
. Two or
three lines can be formed by starting two or three couples.
The columns can also be used as a final figure.

25.—THE CARNIVAL.

All the couples are divided, the ladies being arranged in
one circle, and the gentlemen in another, both circles
facing outwards. A sufficient number of paper costumes,
packed as âfavors,â being in readiness, the leader takes one
of the ladiesâ âfavorsâ and presents it to one of the ladies,
whom he leads inside the ladiesâ circle, where costumes are
put on, and then leads her to her seat. The leaderâs partner

151

at the same time hands a gentlemanâs âfavorâ to one
of the gentlemen, and leads him into his ring to be robed
or decorated, and then is in turn led by him to her seat.
The second couple proceed in like manner, until all have
been accommodated.

The conductor then can organize some short figures for
dancing, forming also groups and tableaux appropriate to
the decorations.

26.—THE HANDKERCHIEF CHASE.

The first three or four couples waltz; the gentlemen
leave their ladies in the center of the room; each lady holds
a handkerchief in her hand. The leader then selects one
more gentleman, who, with the others, form a circle about
the ladies, presenting their backs, and turn rapidly to the
left. The ladies throw their handkerchiefs in the air, and
waltz with those gentlemen who have been fortunate
enough to catch them. The unfortunate gentleman who
does not get a handkerchief selects a lady from the company.
The figure is performed successively by all the
other couples.

27.—THE CARDS.

First couple leads off. Leader presents four ladies the
four queens of a deck of cards; the leaderâs lady presents

152

four gentlemen with four kings of the same deck. The
gentlemen seek the ladies of their suit and dance with
them.

28.—SCISSORS TO GRIND.

Leader and partner waltz once around. Leading lady,
who has been provided with a tin horn, hands this horn
to one of the gentlemen. He begins to walk around the
circle blowing his horn and calling out âScissors to grind,â
until some lady has scissors to grind. Then, taking from
him the tin horn, hands it to another gentleman, who
in turn imitates a âScissors to grindâ character. Gentleman
waltzes once around with the lady who has rescued
him from his honored position of âScissors to grind.â

29.—THE SKATERS.

Two chairs are placed in the room about eight feet
apart. First couple lead off and waltz around the chairs,
describing the figure eight as skaters do. Each couple
in succession repeats the same skating movement.

30.—THE SPIRAL.

Form in line, one couple behind another, all facing the
same way. The first couple turns and passes beneath the
joined hands of the second couple; then separate, passing

153

outside of the third couple; then separate, passing under
the hands of the fourth couple, and so continue to the end
of the line. Each couple repeats the figure in turn.
Partners then face each other, stepping back so as to form
two lines, one of gentlemen and one of ladies. The two
lines forward, and all dance with partners.

31.—THE PYRAMID.

o

o o

o o o

o o o o

Ladies form pyramid, equal number of gentlemen join
hands in line and wind around first lady, next two, etc.;
then reverse the movement until conductor arrives in front
of first lady, with whom he waltzes; other gentlemen waltz
with nearest ladies.

32.—THE GRAND ROUND.

Any number (four or more) lead off, then each lady
selects another lady and each gentleman selects another
gentleman. The dancers form a circle, the gentlemen
forming one half of it and the ladies the other half, the
leading gentleman being next to his partner. All join
hands and circle around to the left. Still retaining hold
of hands, the first lady and gentleman advance across the

154

circle and pass under the raised arms of the opposite lady
and gentleman. When outside the circle, the leading
couple unclasp hands and the gentleman, drawing the
other gentlemen after him, turns to the left and passes
around outside the circle, the lady at the same time turning
to the right and drawing the other ladies after her.
When the leading couple again meet, they dance together
to place, and each successive couple does the same.

33.—THE STAR AND CIRCLE.

Four couples waltz around, then each lady selects another
gentleman, and each gentleman another lady. The
eight couples are arranged in two lines, the four couples
in one line facing the four in the other line. The four
ladies belonging to the middle couples cross right hands
forming a
moulinet
, and swing entirely round to the left,
returning with left hands across to the right. The gentlemen
all join hands and form a circle around these four
ladies. The remaining four ladies now advance, giving
their left hands to the right hands of the ladies composing
the
moulinet
, forming a
star
of ladies, and a circle of
gentlemen. The gentlemen swing round to the right under
the uplifted arms of the ladies, who move around to
the left. At a signal, the gentlemen regain their partners

155

and waltz to places. This figure may be varied, the
gentlemen forming the star and the ladies the circle.

34.—THE DOUBLE PASTOURELLE.

The first four couples lead off with a
tour de valse
, and
place themselves as for a quadrille. The first and second
gentlemen retaining their partnersâ hands, take with their
left hands the side ladies on their left, who leave their
partners, thus forming two threes at the head; they forward
and back four bars; the gentlemen pass the ladies
to the side gentlemen, the lady on the left passing under
their right arms; the three forward and back four bars,
the ladies going to the gentlemen at the head. This figure
is repeated four times, when all dance.

35.—THE LABYRINTH.

In this figure all form a general round, going to the
left. At a given signal the conductor releases the hand
of his lady, who is on his left, and while continuing to
turn in the same direction, enters the circle, making a

colimaÃ§on
, while his lady turns to the right to wind about
the other circles, that go on narrowing. A circular space
should be contrived to be able to extend themselves in
waltzing. In this position the conducting couple set out

156

waltzing, and follow the passes of the labyrinth formed
by the general chain rolling on itself till they have arrived
at the last couple, to which the first lady gives her hand to
renew the circle. As each new couple arrives it places
itself behind the one previous. When all have arrived
they conclude by a general waltz or mazourka. When this
figure is executed in polka, you dance through the passes
of the labyrinth with the waltz
Ã  deux pas
, which requires
less space; when the figure is executed in mazourka, you
have recourse to the mazourka waltz. The Labyrinth is
one of the final figures of the cotillion.

36.—LETTER CARRIER FIGURE.

Boy or girl in uniform of letter carrier with bag and
whistle. Ladies inclose their cards in envelopes (each
separately); they are then collected by the carrier. Gents
form in line, carrier then hands letters, one by one, to
leader, who calls the names as they are handed to him.
First lady called dances with first gentleman and so on
until five couples have waltzed around, when, from a signal
from carrierâs whistle, they find seats and so on with
each succeeding five couples.

37.—THE SERPENT.

First couple leads off. The gentleman leaves his lady

157

in a corner of room facing the wall; then he brings forward
four or five more ladies and places them in a line
behind his partner singly, leaving about two feet space
between each one. He then selects as many gentlemen
(including himself) as there are ladies, with whom he
forms a loose chain and conducts them rapidly in a course
between the ladies (commencing with the last lady) until
he reaches his partner; he then claps his hands and each
gentleman dances with the lady nearest him.

38.—THE PURSUIT.

Three or four couples waltz, and the leader, who is not
dancing, calls other gentlemen to the floor, to act as rovers
and rob the dancing gentlemen of their partners. A
rover gets in front of a dancing couple and claps his
hands, when the gentleman must relinquish his partner.
He immediately seeks to indemnify himself, however, by
securing one of the other ladies in a similar manner.
This figure continues until each gentleman has again got
possession of his lady to conduct her to her place. To
execute this figure with all the animation required, it is
necessary that as fast as each gentleman possesses himself
of a lady another should replace him. The Pursuit is
one of the final figures of the cotillion.

158

39.—THE CHANGING STAR.

Each lady selects a gentleman and each gentleman selects
a lady. The second, fourth and sixth gentlemen,
holding their partnerâs left hands in their right, form a

moulinet
by joining left hands, and all six revolve slowly
to the left. At the same time the first, third and fifth
gentlemen, with their partners, waltz around to the right
in the space between each of the gentlemen in the
moulinet

and his partner and under their raised arms. At a signal,
those who have been waltzing form the
moulinet
, and the
others waltz.

40.—THE VIRGINIA REEL.

Four couples proceed to place themselves in the middle
of the room, as for a Virginia Reel. The first couple lead
off by waltzing around the couple on their right, and in
the same manner make a turn around the other couples.
The other three couples repeat the same figure. When all
the four have done so, they return to their places, waltzing.

41.—THE DOUBLE QUADRILLE.

Four couples waltz, and then form a quadrille. Four
other couples take up positions so that a new couple stand
exactly behind each one of the couples that form the
quadrille. The figure commences by the four inside ladies

159

crossing right hands; they move entirely round, giving
left hands to partners and swinging round to places.
While the inner couples are thus engaged, the four outer
couples waltz half round, outside the quadrille, to opposite
places. Then the inner couples waltz entirely
round, resuming their places, but facing outwards. All
chassez at places; turn at corners with right hands, and
turn partners with left hands to places. All the gentlemen
then waltz to seats with the ladies standing opposite them.

42.—THE FINAL ROUND.

All form a large circle by joining hands. The leader
and his lady separate from the circle, which must be at
once reconnected, and waltz around inside the circle. He
stops at a signal, and the lady passes through the circle
and takes her seat. He then selects another lady, with
whom he dances. At a signal, he retires from the circle,
and the lady with whom he has just danced selects a new
partner from the circle, and so on for the others.

THE END.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

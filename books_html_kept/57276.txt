And fused within one glowing breast

The ardors of the East and West,â

Your tryst with grave Minerva keep,

Yet first on Wisdomâs roll youâll find

The sacred love of humankind!

CHAPTER I

LAUREL FOLKS

It was four oâclock of a hot September
afternoon, and the buzz of twenty
girls released from school filled the
close room with a sibilant overflow, much
like the gossip of bees in a blossoming
elder-bush. The boys had already gone
clattering down the stairs to the ball-field,
and the little maids of the highest
grammar grade demurely prepared to
follow, sipping the sweets of freedom with
more of leisurely enjoyment, in true
feminine fashion.

A long, thin girl of thirteen or so, in a
starched blue gingham frock nearly to
[4]

her sharp knees, who looked somehow as
if blown straight forward by a strong
wind, and a plump bud of a fair-haired
damsel in pink, stood close together in an
eddy of the murmuring stream.

âI donât think itâs fair, Doris; no, I
donât!â were the long girlâs first words
earnestly spoken, as she tossed the lank
locks back from her eager face with a
characteristic gesture.

âDonât think whatâs fair?â queried
Doris, serenely. âOh, Sin, youâve
dropped your glasses!â

âBother the glassesâyou know what
I mean. That wild Indian girl from the
âland of the Ojibways,â or wherever it is
they say sheâs coming to our school, and
the girls will make her life one long
misery, just because she wears a red
blanket, probâly, and a feather or two
in her straight, black hairââ

âYou donât know what youâre talking
[5]

about, Sin Parker. She never wore a
blanket in her life, so there!â

âWhyâwhyâisnât she a sure-ânough
Indian, then, after all?â stammered
romance-loving Cynthia, dropping
the glasses again in her excitement.
âAnd how do
you
happen to know so
much about it, Doris Brown?â

âWell, I do know; mother was out
calling yesterday afternoon, and sheâs
heard all about it. I expect sheâs over at
the Spellman house now. You see, itâs
this wayâ¦â And the two girls, with
arms about each otherâs waists and
absorbed faces, drifted through the big
doors in their turn and followed a chattering,
fluttering throng down the wide, elm-lined
village street.

In the prim parlor of an old New England
homestead, watched over by the
ghostly crayon portraits of departed
[6]

ancestors, the fate of the brown-skinned
little stranger was equally the topic of
discussion.

Mrs. Brown, a stout, motherly lady in
a creaking black silk, had timed her call
neatly for the second day after the arrival
from the west of Miss Spellmanâs widowed
sister, whose husband had lived for twenty
years as a missionary among the Indians,
and her unusual charge.

âNo, I was never in favor of bringing
the child to Laurel. I strongly advised
Lucy to place her at once in one of the
excellent Government boarding-schools
for Indian children. I understand that
they are everything that could be desired
for a girl in her positionâclean and well-managedâthe
common branches thoroughly
taught, together with housework
and sewing.â

Miss Sophia spoke with her usual
positiveness in that hard, clear-cut voice
[7]

of hers, raising her white, aquiline profile
a trifle against the shadowy background
of her ancestral âbest room.â

âWhy, sister,â pleaded gentle Mrs.
Waring, almost tearfully, âI could no
more have left my little girl in one of those
big, bare, whitewashed barracks â¦
to eat coarse food off thick stoneware
in a noisy dining-room â¦ to sleep with
fifty other girls in a dormitory where the
beds almost touch â¦ sheâs not used
to anything like that! I tell you, the
child is as sensitive as you or I.â

âI must beg of you, Lucy, not to
mention
my
name in any such connection,â
interposed her sister. âIt would
certainly seem that a school expressly
provided for just such girls as Yellow
Starâor whatever her ridiculous name
isâmust be the proper place for her.
However, you were determined to bring
her home with you, and you have had
[8]

your way. It remains to be seen what
will come of itâ¦ Let me fill your
glass, Emmeline.â

âNo, thank you, Sophia,â murmured
good Mrs. Brown, hastily finishing her
iced tea, and setting the thin, frosted
goblet with its bits of shaved lemon peel
on the silver tray at her hostessâs elbow.
Sophia certainly did have a positive gift
for making folks uncomfortable. âI
surely do hope,â she plucked up courage
to add, âthat Yellow Star will do well
in Laurel, and be happy with us, now that
she is here.â

âWe call her Stella,â faltered Mrs.
Waring. âIt seemed wiser â¦â (here
Miss Sophia indulged in what might in a
less aristocratic dame have been plainly
called a sniff) â¦ âwiser not to retain
anything that might tend to make her
needlessly conspicuousââ

âOh, I see! âStellaââthatâs very
[9]

pretty. I understand you are sending
her to grammar school?â

âStella will enter the eighth grade to-morrow,â
Mrs. Waring answered, drawing
courage from the delicate sympathy conveyed
in her old friendâs soft, purring
tones. âShe is nearly fourteen, and I
want her to be thoroughly prepared for
the academy next year.â

âWhy, Iâm surprised! How ever did you
manage it, Lucy? Thatâs my Dorisâs gradeâand
Doris was fourteen last month.â

âI have taught Stella myself up to
now,â her adopted mother announced
with modest pride, âand a quicker or
more willing pupil I never met with anywhere.
Yes, Iâve talked with the superintendent;
he questioned her himself;
and he says she could get into the academy
this fall, he thinks, but advises a
year in the grades to give her more confidence
and lay a better foundation.â

[10]

âFoundation for whatâcan any one
tell me that?â Miss Sophia had been
silent an unusually long time, for her.
âIâm afraid my sister hasnât considered
that to educate the child above her
station in life and out of sympathy with
her own people will only lead to her unhappiness
in the end. If you would only
take my advice, Lucy, before itâs too late,
and train the child for a little maidâsince
you will have her with youâinstead
of spoiling her as you doâ¦â

âStella is my little girl, sister,â interrupted
the gentle Lucy, with the
unexpected daring of some timid animal
brought to bay. âShe shall share whatever
I have, and for as long as I live.
Please remember that she hasnât a blood
relation in the world, so far as she knows,
and is perfectly free to live
anywhere
. I
intend to give her a good educationâjust
as good as she can take, or as I
[11]

would have given my own daughter, if I
had oneâand the rest is in Godâs
handsâand her own!â

There was a minuteâs tense silence.
Then Miss Sophia ostentatiously began
a conversation on quite another subject
with her subdued caller, who wanted
nothing so much just then as to catch a
glimpse of the unconscious bone of contention,
but simply dared not ask in so
many words to see Yellow Star.

Lucy sat back in her chair with her
thin hands squeezed tightly together,
trying hard to recover her composure.
It was quite true that Sophia had opposed
from the first her purpose to adopt
and educate the child, and had yielded
ungraciously enough in the end, merely
because she had exhausted her weapons.
There were but the two sisters left, and
the homestead belonged to them equally.
Mr. Waring had died the year before,
[12]

leaving only the few hundred dollars that
represented a missionaryâs scanty savings.
It was entirely natural and right that his
widow should come home to live, and
quite impossible for her to leave behind
the waif whom she had picked up in the
Indian camp some eight or nine years
earlier, and had taken fully into her heart
and home. Her dear husband had loved
and believed in the child, just as she did.
Yes, Sophia was making it very hard for
her, who shrank unspeakably from anything
like a contest of wills; yet the
purpose with which she had come back
to the old home was unshaken.

As Lucy sat there, struggling with
painful thoughts and oblivious to the
murmur of civil conversation, her quick
eye caught a flash of whiteâevidently
a slip of folded paper that some one had
slid in the crack of the closed door. She
hastily left her chair, and with her
[13]

sisterâs cold gray eye upon her, secured
the paper and slipped out of the room
with it in her hand, for it was naturally
impossible to open it under that fire of
suspicious and almost hostile glances.
The hall was empty, and she dropped
down on a haircloth covered davenport
and read:

â
Mother Dear
: Iâve done everything
you said unpackt my things put
them away ironed the napkins put on
a clean frock for tea and set the table.
I just
have
to go out in the orchard and
think awhile. I wanted dreadfully to
pick some flowers but Aunt said not to
and Iâm not going to. If you want me
for anything you can find me in Apple-Tree
Row next the Fence. I call it my
House. Your Little Girl.â

This writing of unnecessary notes was
a harmless fancy of Yellow Starâs, that
[14]

her foster-mother had not had the heart
to correct. She had had so few playmates
on the reservationâfor she
wasnât allowed to play with the camp
children, and it had happened that but
one of the agency people had a little
girl of suitable age and irreproachable
proprietyâthat she had been really
obliged to invent most of her own
amusements. And then, too, Lucy had
told herself that âthe child couldnât
have too much practice in English.â

But the âsilly trick,â as Miss Sophia
called it, had already been a source of
some disquiet in the ill-assorted little
household of three. Perhaps she had
better give the child a hint. And
Sophia had contemptuously repudiated
the title of âAunt,â so naturally bestowed
on the only sister of the only
mother that little Yellow Star had ever
known. âNone of that nonsense for
[15]

me,â she had declared. â
I
havenât
adopted the child!â

âI suppose Iâll have to tell her not to
say it any more â¦ and sheâll think
it so strange,â mused poor Lucy ruefully
enough, foreseeing many trials for
her darling, as she gathered up her nice
black skirt and made her way as daintily
as a cat along the box-bordered walk,
past the grape arbor and the tidy kitchen
garden into the grassy old apple orchard.
She seldom went out-of-doors, except
for church, or calling, or shopping, or on
some entirely rational errand. It was
perhaps the only trait of Stellaâs that
she vaguely disapprovedâthis craze
to be off and into all sorts of outlandish
places. Where under the canopy was
she now? There was the last row of
trees bending with red and yellow fruit,
at the further end of the orchard, and
no sign of her.

[16]

Everything was warm and sweet and
very still. Only the invisible choir of
crickets made silence musical, and a
flaming torch of goldenrod beside the
crumbling old stone wall seemed ready
to light the summerâs funeral pyre. Not
that Lucy Waring thought of it in just
that way, but possibly Stellaâs dreams
and fancies might have been so translated.

Perhaps it had not been quite polite
to leave the house so abruptly before
their guest had taken her leave. She had
forgotten â¦ ought she to go back at
once? But where could the child be?
she wondered. As she stood hesitating,
a low, sweet call made her look quickly
up, and next instant a girlish figure
swung down out of the old apple-tree
and dropped lightly upon its feet.

A girlish figure swung down out of the old apple-tree and

Page 16.

Hair of a dense blue-black was neatly
braided and tied up with red ribbon that
[17]

matched the red plaid in her irreproachable
gingham frock; a faint sort of underglow
warmed the smooth, brown skin; a
something spirited about the carriage of
the well-shaped head and a singular
directness in the glance of the soft, black
eyes were the first things you noticed.
Surely, this was no ordinary child.

âOh, mother, mother!â she cried,
impulsively throwing her arms around
the little ladyâs neck. âIsnât it beautiful?
Oh, I wish we had real grass and apple-trees
in Dakota, donât you? It wasnât
wrong to come out here, was it? Donât
say it was wrong, mother! Canât this
be my House to come out to when Miss
Sophia doesnât want me? I feel as if she
didnât want me; her house seems to
push me right out somehow. And Iâm
terribly afraid of going to school; Iâve
been thinking how perhaps the other
girls wonât want me either.â

[18]

âYou must be brave, darling,â quavered
poor Mrs. Waring. âRemember,
this strangeness will all wear off very
soon.â

âOh, I shall be
brave
,â burst out Yellow
Star, letting her slender arms fall at her
sides, and holding her jet-crowned head
higher than ever. âMy people have
always been brave, you knowâso of
course I have to be! And nobody at all
will ever know how afraid I am â¦
nobody but you, mother.

âThat yellow-haired girl in the pink
dress that just went up the straight path
to the front door â¦ there she comes
down again with the stout lady with shiny
black beads all over her bonnet and
her tight, black waistâshe looks just
like some kind of large, shining beetle,
doesnât she?âwell, my heart beats
so it shakes me all over when I even

think
of going up and speaking to that
[19]

girl in pink! I think sheâs perfectly
beautifulâand Iâm terribly afraid of
herâbut
sheâll
never guess how I feel.
Thereâs one thing I have to tell you,
though,â she added in a more subdued
voice. âI find I canât call Miss Sophia
âAuntâ any more. Do you think youâll
mind very much, mother? Iâm almost
certain she canât be any real relation.â

[20]

CHAPTER II

THE GIRL FROM DAKOTA

Lucy Waring had no warriorsâ
blood that she knew of to fall
back upon, so perhaps it was
partly her long association with the stoics
of the plains that made it possible for her
to turn over her little girl to the ânew
teacher,â the very next day, with the stiff
smile of her New England forebears under
social duressâto drag her eyes away
from the wild, despairing courage of
Yellow Starâs great black onesâto
walk quite steadily out of the door and
down the long flight of wooden steps and
along the drowsy village street, without
even a backward look to share or soften
the imaginary terrors of School.

These took no worse form, just at first,
[21]

than the curious but not unfriendly
stares of forty-two pairs of critical young
eyes, and the penetrating susurrus of
forty-two edged voices, all of which the
Indian girl felt with a pricking and
tingling anguish in every fiber of her
sensitive body, as she sat rigid in a
front seat, directly facing the teacherâs
desk.

Then the second bell rang, and there
was a hush. As soon as she could, after
opening exercises, Miss Morrison supplied
the new pupil with pen and ink and
the usual blank for the school record. It
looked something like this:

Your name in full.

Date of birth. Year, month and day.

Name of father.

Fatherâs occupation.

School previously attended.

What grade were you in?

[22]

A wild glance down the length of the
paper made it certain that her worst
fears had been promptly realized, and
poor Stella, after setting down her new
name, Stella Waring, sat staring at the
other five questions, fairly tense with
nervous dread, until her busy teacher
had found time to note the situation.
Then she bent over the girl from Dakota
and asked very kindly, in a low voice:

âWhy donât you put down your age
and your fatherâs name, Stella?â

âI do not know my date of birth, year,
month and day; I do not know my
fatherâs name and occupation, and I
never went to school before,â she replied
in tones sharpened by fright, so that
they rang through the crowded school-room,
causing an audible gasp of astonishment.

âWhy, I was certainly told that you
belonged here,â wondered Miss Morrison;
[23]

then, with ready tact divining something
of the girlâs embarrassment:

âNever mind about the questions just
now. This is our lesson for to-day; look
it over, please, and be prepared to stand
and read when I call upon you.â

This Stella could do, and knew she
could. Abundant time was given to
recover herself; then the paragraph assigned
was read, if somewhat slowly and
with the faintest trace of foreign accent,
yet distinctly, and with more delicacy
of modulation than perhaps any other
in that room could command.

âVery good, indeed,â approved Miss
Morrison; and this time the slight buzz
sounded almost like encouragement, and
the pricking and tingling were less agonizing
than before.

When the others passed out at recess,
Stella remained in her seat at a sign from
the teacher, who sat down beside her and
[24]

bent her violet-scented brown head sympathetically
toward her singular but far
from unattractive new pupil.

âAbout the age, dear,â she began, tentatively,
âsurely you must knowâ¦â

âI am supposed to be thirteen years
old, Miss Morrison, but I have not any
birthday. MotherâI mean Mrs. Waringâalways
makes me a birthday cake
on the nineteenth of February, because
she says it is so sort of lonesome not to
have a birthday. But I do not know

really
, so of course I could not put it
down on the paper. You see, I â¦ I
was
found
! I never heard my fatherâs
name or my motherâs name eitherânobody
knows who they were.â

Here the clear voice got somehow
muffled, and the warm-hearted teacher
hastily assured her that it didnât matter
one bit about the questionsâshe
had had no ideaâand impulsively
[25]

she took the hated paper out of the little
girlâs sensitive brown hand.

It might have been as well if Lucy
Waring had explained matters somewhat
before her abrupt departure; but the
truth was that she had strung her difficult
courage to the necessary point of
leaving the child to her own resources
in this strange, and possibly unfriendly,
new environment. The effort had carried
her to a really unnecessary extreme; she
had forgotten that Yellow Starâs personal
history was as yet quite unknown in
Laurel.

Miss Morrison felt the incident to be a
touching one. She even reproached herself
for thoughtless adherence to routine,
and during the rest of the morning gave
a quite unusual degree of attention to
her new charge. It appeared that Stella
had the correct eye and delicate hand of
her race; she was an excellent penman;
[26]

she had been well drilled in the essentials.
More: she was eager, alert, intenseâquick
to spring upon an idea as a cat
upon its prey.

Most of the children went home at
noon, and no sooner was school dismissed
than Cynthia Parker, whose near-sighted
brown eyes had been turned anxiously,
half maternally toward the stranger, at
the cost of frequent, though not unusual,
blunders in her own recitations,
darted to her side and began to speak
rapidly.

âI know who you are; Doris Brown
told me; sheâs that yellow-haired girl in
pinkâsee! sheâs looking this way. My
nameâs Cynthia Parker and I hope
weâll be friendsâI read everything I
can get hold of about Indiansâmother
says Iâm just like one. Do you like
dogs?â And almost before Stella could
find breath to reply, in her pretty,
[27]

precise English, that she did, Sin had
taken up the tale.

âIâve got twoâthatâs the big one
waiting for me outsideâhis nameâs
Sir Walter Scott, but we call him Scotty
for short. Here, Scotty, old fellow!â
And as the gaunt hound rushed upon
them both, nearly knocking them down
in his eagerness, she threw her arms
around his homely neck and hugged him
with an unaffected ardor that quite
warmed the new girlâs heart.

âLetâs walk slowly and get behind;
can we?â she whispered, shyly. âThey
do look at us so!â In fact, there was
unwonted lingering that day, and much
open whispering, which the three pretended
to ignore. Doris had waited, as
usual, and joined them at the door.

âOf course we can; nobody has dinner
till half past twelve, and itâs only five
minutesâ walk to your house,â she assented,
[28]

pleasantly, while Cynthia bluntly
remarked:

âTheyâre awfully disappointed, you
know, because you didnât wear your
Indian suit to-dayâa blanket and
feathers in your hair. Why, you look
almost exactly like anybody else, in that
nice, brown linen.â

âIndian girls donât wear feathers;
only the men do that,â smiled the new
girl, who much preferred to âlook like
anybody else,â and found personalities
a bit embarrassing. Still, she was feeling
a good deal better in the company of her
new-found friends.

âThen do they all wear pretty blouses
and stylish hats?â Sin unblushingly
inquired.

âWell, there arenât many of the old-style
dresses left among the Siouxâmy
people. Why, a blanket robe trimmed
with real elksâ teeth, or one of beaded
[29]

doeskin, is worth a hundred dollars!
Besides, nearly all the girls go to school
nowadays, and wear dresses and hats
like mine,âonly not quite so pretty,
perhaps, because my dear mother made
these and she has such good taste,â
ended Stella, loyally and lovingly.

âMrs. Waring is perfectly lovely, I
think,â began Doris, tactfully, but suddenly
broke off with a little cry of dismay.

âOh, Sin! whose dog is that? Hadnât
you better get the chain on Scotty?â

Alas, the warning came too late! The
strange dog had already offered some
nameless canine impertinence to Sir Walter,
whose temper was none of the most
patient. Instantly he hurled himself upon
the new-comer, and the fight was on.

The three girls had purposely loitered,
and the quiet street was almost deserted.
It was the universal dinner hour, and
boys and girls were rapidly disappearing
[30]

down various side streets, urged homewards
by the double spur of sharp young
appetites and savory odors of âmotherâs
cooking.â

âHelp! help!â screamed Sin, and
forthwith flung herself with more valor
than discretion upon the wallowing mass
in the middle of the dusty road.

Doris grew very white, as she set her
back to the hedge, drew her spotless
skirts tightly around her, and earnestly
begged her friend to âbe careful!â But
heedless, brave, loving Sin, crying loudly
now and terribly alarmed for Scottyâs
safety, persisted in wild and none too
prudent attempts to drag him bodily
forth from the fray. The strange dog
had fastened viciously upon his throat,
and the fight began to look serious.
Why
didnât
some one come?

In that very minute some one did,
and the âsome oneâ was no other than
[31]

the girl from Dakota. She had broken
a stout switch from an apple-tree that
overhung the sidewalk near at hand,
and was belaboring the strange dog in a
steady, business-like fashion, at the same
time calling him off in ringing tones, and
in a language that he evidently understood,
if her astonished classmates did
not.

âKigelÃ¡! kigelÃ¡!â they thought they
heard her say, over and over; and
whether the strange words composed a
sort of charm or secret incantation for
dogs, or whether it was some compelling
power in the personality of the black-haired
girl, or merely the flail-like regularity
of her vigorous blows, it is certain
at any rate that he soon let go his hold,
and ran yelping away.

Sir Walter, gallantly scrambling to his
long legs and shaking his bleeding but
still warlike head, would gladly have
[32]

followed, but was forcibly restrained by
his disheveled mistress, who had contrived
at last to snap the chain upon his
collar, and while breathlessly dragging
him homewards, did not forget to call
back over her shoulder in broken phrases
her admiring gratitude to Yellow Star.

[33]

CHAPTER III

A LESSON IN HISTORY

The square north parlor of the
century-old Spellman homestead
was furnished with few concessions
to modern taste. In summer it was
carefully darkened, and during the colder
months exhaled that penetrating chill
that is still more or less characteristic of
the traditional âbest roomâ in rural
New England. There was also a mingled
odor of sanctity and dried rose-leaves that
filled the soul of the young exile with a
secret awe. She understood perfectly that
children were not expected to enter that
room uninvited; even the family reserved
it for occasions of ceremony; and
it was with a thrill of conscious guilt
[34]

overborne by an irresistible attraction,
that she had stolen in alone on this keen
October morning before Miss Sophia was
up, and while her sister was capably engaged
in preparing breakfast in the large,
cheery kitchen.

It was not the ornaments, wonderful
as they were, upon the high mantel-pieceâthe
pallid wax flowers under glass, the
waving pampas plumes and pink-lined
tropic shells dear to romanceâno,
not even the mysterious closed pianoâit
was those ghostly crayon portraits in
their tarnished gilt frames that drew this
little unrelated fragment of humanity
with a fascination that she did not in the
least understand. She only knew that
to gaze upon their white, shrouded faces
was to yearn for even the staring, pictured
counterparts, even the chill, clustered
gravestones of her own vanished
forebears. Vanished, indeed, since not
[35]

even a name or a memory remained to
their wistful and solitary descendant!

And these Spellmans and Russellsâthese
revered ancestors of her dear
âMotherâ Waring as of the thorny and
unapproachable Miss Sophiaâtheir by-gone
greatness had been so impressed
upon her by allusion and suggestion that
in the secret world of her imagination it
reached heroic proportions. So this child
of two races, the one by birth, the other
by associations quite as real and vital,
well-nigh forgot the shadowy demi-gods
of her people while she bowed at the shrine
of the commonplace county Judge who
was the greatest of all the Russells, and
fancied a beauty as of the moon and stars
in the conventional portraits of his wife
and daughters, with their uncovered
necks and pallid, simpering faces.

Only a few stolen moments of gazing,
and Stella crossed the dark hall on noiseless
[36]

feetâfor even in the black-leather
boxes of civilization she had contrived
to keep her native lightness of stepâand
softly opened the dining-room door.

With its cheerful morning sunshine
streaming over the chromoed walls and
gayly-carpeted floor, and with the canary
singing his prettiest in the south window,
above the row of thrifty geraniums and
begonias, this room was the strongest
possible contrast to the gloomy one she
had just left behind. Ah! and that very
minute the wonderful bird came out of
the clock on the mantel-piece and seven
times called âCuckoo!â while, as if in
answer to the call, the door into the
kitchen opened, letting in the heartsome
odor of frying ham and eggs, and Mother
Waring with the smoking coffee-pot.

Stella flew to bring the dish of oatmeal
and the hot plates, and then busied herself
with the neat tray that was regularly
[37]

carried up to Miss Sophiaâs chamber
with her morning coffee and toast. To
be sure, the elder sister was only five
years older than Lucy, who owned to
fifty-two, and who, folks said, had
always been âkinder pindlinâ,â and in
truth was now much worn with hard
work and recent grief. But we know that
there are always people who contrive to
be waited upon, and others to whom it
naturally falls to do the waiting.

Housewifely traditions were closely
adhered to in Laurel, where but few even
of the âfirst familiesâ kept a maid, and
it was now Stellaâs duty, together with
dishwashing and dusting and such of the
lighter household tasks as Lucy would
allow her to undertake, to carry up Miss
Sophiaâs tray. Even that lady had
grudgingly conceded that âthe child
wasnât as clumsy and heavy-footed as
you might expect,â though why you
[38]

shouldnât expect anything of the sort it
would have taken a better ethnologist
than Miss Sophia to explain.

The little ceremony ended, and the
hard old eyes met with a low-voiced
âGood morning,â and a rather frightened
smile, the two ate their own substantial
breakfast with a hearty appetite,
and directly afterward âflew âroundâ to
get dishes and other âchoresâ out of the
way before school-time. At a quarter
to nine, Stella put on her neat jacket and
knitted red tam-oâ-shanter, hugged her
kind foster-mother, and set out with
cheerfulness upon her morning pilgrimage,
glancing about shyly at the first
corner for a possible glimpse of demure
Doris tripping along the sidewalk, or
scatter-brained Cynthia flying breathlessly
down the hill.

Laurel, like many another village of its
ilk, was an odd mixture of modern democratic
[39]

conditions with the elder social
inheritance. In the village school, the
children of European peasants, the earlier
and quick-witted Irish, the later Poles,
with their broad, heavy faces, two or
three brilliant, undersized young Jews,
and the dark-brown scions of several
long-established negro families, sat side
by side with the severely self-respecting
descendants of the earliest Puritan stock.
The six and seven-year-olds knew no
difference, and flocked indiscriminately
together at recess, but it must be admitted
that the caste idea grew with
their growth, and that in grammar-school
and academy circles the lines
were drawn more definitely than in many
larger places, to the end of needless
resentments and heartaches.

Yellow Star added one more ingredient
to the racial melting-pot. But whether
because of a certain aboriginal dignity,
[40]

or the name and protection of a family as
much respected as any in Laurel, at any
rate nearly everybody found it possible
to accept her with excellent grace, and
it might have been something personal
to herself that bid fair to complete her
conquest of the village. Two of the very
ânicestâ girls in Laurel, Cynthia, whose
father was supposed to be the âbest
fixedâ merchant in town, and Doris, the
busy Doctorâs only child, were already her
devoted friends.

Notwithstanding the fact that she had
promptly taken her place among the
best scholars in the room, the girl from
Dakota had not yet lost her sense of
audacity in rising to recite before so imposing
a company.

âWhy, Stella! you donât have to dig
at your books the way you do; itâs
absurd! Look at me; I havenât opened
a single one since Friday afternoon, and
[41]

I
get along,â argued happy-go-lucky
Sin.

âBut you belong here, and you have
been to school always. It is different
with me. This is my one chance of really

belonging
.â And, contrary to all advice
and precedent, Stella persisted in regarding
school as a privilege to be lived
up to, and failure in recitation as deep
disgrace.

The first thing after recess was American
History review.

âHow did the early settlers treat the
Indians? Mary Maloney,â began Miss
Morrison.

âThey treated them fine,â declared the
auburn-haired Mary, with a sly glance
over her shoulder at the unreasonably
popular new arrival.

âWhat did the Indians do? Rosey
Bernstein.â

âThe cruel and treacherous savages
[42]

turned upon the defenseless settlers with
fire anâ ax,â Rosey glibly recited. âThey
now began a series of frightful massacres.â

âThey stove the babiesâ heads in,
right in front of their mothersâ faces, and
then made the mothers walk hundreds of
miles barefoot in the deep snow,â eagerly
amended woolly-headed Pete Holley, and
all the boys wagged their heads and
grinned with satisfaction.

âAfter they had scalped all the fathers
by the light oâ their burninâ buildings,â
finished Rosey complacently.

Several hands went up, but Yellow
Star in her excitement quite forgot to
wait for the teacherâs permission.

âWho says that the settlers were kind
to the Indians?â rang out in challenging
tones.

More hands madly clawed the air, and
Miss Morrison rather unwillingly nodded
to Rosey, who read from her open book:

[43]

ââThey treated the Indians for the
most part with justice and kindness, notwithstanding
which the cruelâââ

âThat will do for the present, Rosey,â
interrupted her teacher, and was hastily
casting about in her own mind for a basis
of compromise between warring factions
when a certain black-eyed little
heroine rose precipitately to her feet,
and delivered her soul without fear or
favor.

âWas it treating them with justice and
kindness to take their lands away from
them, and give them only a few beads
and knives for thousands of acres? Was
it fair to give them whiskey to drink, and
knives to kill people with, and then when
they were drunk and angry and killed
some bad white men, to punish the whole
tribe by burning their villages and wives
and children?â demanded her peopleâs
advocate.

[44]

âDid the âcruel, treacherous savagesâ
take away all the white peopleâs guns and
then shoot them down, women with little
babies and boys and girls smaller than
us? Did they chase them all over the
prairie and kill them while they begged
for mercy, and then call it a
battle
?
Thatâs what your soldiers did to us, and

I was in it
! Maybe, if we wrote the
history books, there wouldnât be so much
in them about the âtreacherous Indians!ââ

Breathless and darkly flushed, the girl
from Dakota sank into her seat, and there
was an awful hush.

Cynthia was staring at her friend with
open-mouthed admiration, and tender-hearted
Doris had her face hidden on her
desk, while most of the children, horror-struck,
yet thoroughly enjoying the situation,
looked hopefully to âTeacherâ
for summary vengeance on the daring
rebel against constituted authority.

[45]

That personage, however, gazed
straight before her with expressionless
face, until the silence had grown positively
fearsome in its explosive quality. Then
she simply remarked:

âClose your books, children! Our
lesson in history is over for to-day.â

â
Apple-Tree House, Monday
.

â
Dear Mother-of-Mine
, I love Miss
Morrison she never said a word though
I was bad to-day and talked right out
in school. The book was wrong and I
was right but that didnât make it proper
for me to talk did it? But Miss Morrison
is a Angel and Doris Brown cried because
she was sorry for the poor Indians. I
love her too. How many kind people
there are in the world! I am so happy
I almost feel as if I could love Miss
Sophia but not quite. Your Little Girl.â

[46]

CHAPTER IV

THE-ONE-WHO-WAS-LEFT-ALIVE

The traditional Thanksgiving dinner
was a ceremony never omitted
at the Spellman homestead, even
though there had been years when Miss
Sophia had eaten it quite alone, with a
determination rather grim than grateful.
This year, there were the two elderly
sisters, alone in their generation, yet with
little in common save their family history
and childhood memories, and the little
maid from sun-steeped plains of far-off
Dakota who sat sedately between them,
plying her knife and fork with a decorum
that even Miss Sophia could not gainsay.
Now and again her black eyes darted
keenly from one subdued face to the
other, as if in search of something; a
[47]

âtrick,â Miss Sophia said, that made her
âas nervous as a witch!â

The long, heavy, and, to tell the truth,
rather silent and oppressive meal had
come to an end at last, with pumpkin
pie and Indian pudding made punctiliously
after the old family recipes, and a
mold of âquaking jelly,â that had been
a favorite of Lucyâs from childhood.
After the black coffee was brought in,
Stella slid her nuts and raisins into her
pocket, and rose at a nod from her foster-mother.

âMrs. Maloney will wash the dishes
to-day, dear,â she said. âYou may go out
now, or do anything you like for the rest
of the day. And I think I hear Cynthiaâs
whistle,â she added, indulgently.

Miss Sophia sighed aggressively. That
clear, boyish whistle was a fresh offense
in her ears.

âGo out by the side door, Stella; and,
[48]

whatever you do, donât let in that dog
with his great, muddy feet!â she commanded;
sure that, if Cynthia were
coming, Scotty could not be far off.

âCome on down to Dorisâ house,â
burst out Sin, before the door was fairly
open. âItâs always lots of fun down
there; her mother lets us crack nuts and
pop corn and everything. Mother has a
headache again and I mustnât make any
noise around home, and of course itâs
solemn as a church hereâât always is.
Canât you come, Jibby?â she begged,
anxiously.

(The new name was short for âOjibway,â
invented to tease the little Sioux girl, but
Yellow Star accepted it, as she did most
things, with quite stoical composure.)

âYes, I can, Sin; I can do anything I
want all the rest of to-day,â she answered,
gravely. âBut oh! do letâs go to the
woods!â

[49]

âAll right; put on your things quick,
and come along! (Down, Scotty! down,
sir!) We must stop for Doris, though;
and I think Miss Morrisonâs there to
dinner to-day.â

Stellaâs night-black eyes glowed at
this, for she silently worshiped her sympathetic
teacher.

Arrived at the Doctorâs, they found a
large and merry party gathered around
the air-tight stove in the shabby parlor,
listening with enthusiasm to the warbling
of operatic stars on the new phonograph,
followed by a âpieceâ on the piano by
demure Doris. There were Grandpa and
Grandma Brown, a brisk and well-preserved
old couple, with cheeks like rosy
winter apples; Uncle Si Wolcott, Mrs.
Brownâs eccentric bachelor brother, who
lived all alone in a white farmhouse on
the âBay road,â Doris and her father
and mother, and, finally, two guests
[50]

who were not âkinâ to any one else
present.

One was Miss Morrison, whose home
was in an up-to-date little city in a
neighboring State, and who must otherwise
have eaten her Thanksgiving dinner
rather forlornly in a boarding-house; the
other, a lanky boy of sixteen or so, who
wore glasses and a thoughtful air, had
created some amusement for the giggling
girls at the academy by his name, which
was Honey. When thus appealed to in
the velvet tones of some âlady teacher,â
the girls seemed to think it funny. His
âfront nameâ was Ethan, and he was
an orphan with his own way to make, his
nearest relative a none too loving âaunt
by marriage,â which explains his appearance
on the day of family reunions at
Mother Brownâs hospitable table.

The present was not, as Grandpa
Brown had more than once remarked
[51]

with apparently a distinct sense of personal
injury, a âgenoowine old-fashioned
Thanksgivinâ.â Far from affording the
excellent sleighing which had been expected
to facilitate family gatherings in
Grandpaâs day, and the coasting that had
undoubtedly sharpened the youngstersâ
appetites for âturkey anâ fixinâs,â an
unseasonable Indian summer warmth
pervaded this particular twenty-seventh
of November. When the young people
set out on their walk, Ethan Honey and
Miss Morrison being included, they found
the country roads soft underfoot, rusty
green leaves yet clinging to the wide-spreading
apple boughs, with here and
there a frost-bitten apple, and even the
yellow of ripe corn still nestling in some
of the brown stooks that dotted the fields
like tattered and smoke-stained wigwams.
Red alder berries and gray clematis
fringes and the âghosts of the goldenrodâ
[52]

adorned the wayside, while the
purple-brown woodlands melted into a
nameless haze upon the lonely horizon
line.

âIâm fond of cross-country hikes, arenât
you?â Ethan observed, as he turned to
offer Stella an informal lift over the low
stone wall that lay between them and
a short cut to âWolcottâs Woods.â

âI do not know that word âhikes,ââ
she answered, in her slow, careful English,
âbut if it is anything like to-day, I
am sure I shall like it very much. I never
really knew about Thanksgiving before.â

âOh, didnât you?â asked the boy,
trying not to stare at his self-possessed
little companion, whose cadenced voice
and quaint ways, as well as her unusual
appearance, might have given him some
excuse. âI suppose of course your people
donât keep Thanksgiving,â he added,
awkwardly.

[53]

âFather and Mother Waring always
had the good dinner and the church service,â
Stella answered, âbut somehow I
never understood about the family part.
I suppose because I was only a little girl
then; or else because they donât have
families out in Dakota! I mean, there
are so many lonely ones whose families
are back east, with the old houses and the
old names and all the old things,â the
girl persisted, greatly to Ethanâs secret
amusement at her unexpected point of
view.

âBut, Stellaâthat
is
your name, isnât
it?â he began.

âIt is one of my names,â she replied
with dignity. But just then Scotty
dashed between them, nearly upsetting
both, while Sin followed with scarcely
less of abandon, shrieking âA woodchuck!
A woodchuck!â at the top of
her voice.

[54]

âI wouldnât go any nearer if I were
you, Cynthia,â advised Ethan gravely,
while Doris and her teacher, calling out
futile appeals to âbe careful,â lagged
breathless in the rear.

âItâs nothing but a horrid old skunk,â
Cynthia presently complained, coming
back quite crestfallen. âWill you never
learn anything, you old dunderhead?â
This to the sheepish Sir Walter, whom
she had by his collar and the hair of his
head.

âWhen youâve skinned as many as I
have, you wonât be liable to make any
mistake,â the boy observed; whereat
Doris shuddered visibly.

âYou know,â she informed the others,
âEthan skins everything he can get hold
ofâand cuts them up, too, as often
as notâcats and dogs and rabbits
and frogsâugh! He calls it âstudying
biology,ââisnât it perfectly dreadful?â

[55]

âEthan will probably be a great scientist,
some day,â suggested Miss Morrison.

âHeâs going to be a doctor, he says,â
Cynthia bluntly objected, causing the boy
to blush uncomfortably, while Stella
regarded him with new respect.

To change the subject, he said something
about prairie-dogs, and the girl
from Dakota was called upon for an
offhand description of these interesting
animals, which she gave soberly enough,
though making the others laugh with her
quaint characterizations and clever mimicry.

Having crossed several fields and followed
a farm lane to its end, Ethan let
down a âpair oâ bars,â and the company
climbed a rocky pasture knoll, where
Yellow Starâs quick eye caught something
gleaming like dull fire among the dead
brown of the bare bushes.

âWhat is that? It is like a sunset!â
[56]

she exclaimed, and Cynthia echoed
her.

âOh, what is it? Oh, how beautiful!â

âBitter-sweet, and the finest I ever
saw!â declared Miss Morrison, with
enthusiasm. âOh, oh! was there ever
such a mass of it before? Have you a
knife about you, Ethan? I simply must
have some for my school-room; it will
make a dream of a decoration, and last
all winter.â

Cynthia and Doris ran about and exclaimed
and unwound the most splendid
branches, but the Indian girl stood quite
still and let the beauty of it all sink deep
into her heart. Years later, the sight
of a red-gold spray, or even the very
name of âbitter-sweet,â brought up that
riot of color on the rocky knoll, and the
wordless sadness of those veiled and
lonely hills.

âNow, girls, we simply must get on,
[57]

or it will be dark before we can walk to
Wolcottâs Woods and back again,â declared
Ethan resolutely, shutting his
knife with a snap. The whole party followed
his lead past a fringe of hemlock,
maple, hornbeam and white birch, on to
a wild and deep glen that suddenly
opened at their very feet, with a foaming
brook in its heart. Scrambling down the
steep sides of the miniature canyon, they
followed the stream to its outlet in a
tiny pond, which is flanked on one side
by the finest grove of pine in Laurel
township.

âThis is Uncle Siâs ice-pond,â announced
Doris, proudly, âand
these
are
Wolcottâs Woods!â

It was so mild that Ethan insisted
upon taking off his coat, cushioning a
giant log where the girls might sit and
rest after their three-mile tramp, while
the sun already glowed red through the
[58]

autumn haze, near to the western horizon.

âArenât you glad we came, Jibby?â
urged Sin, ecstatically.

âJibby â¦ another of those names
of yours, I suppose,â teased Ethan,
gently.

âNo, not my name at all,â she told
him, holding her head the least bit higher.
âMy school name is Stella, because it is
the Latin for Star. I was called Yellow
Star before that, because it is the English
of my own name.â

âAnd that is?â

âI do think you could not pronounce
it, but I will say it very slowly. Wee-chahÂ´-pee-zeeÂ´-weeâlike
that. No, the
second syllable is roughâin the throatâso!â

âAspirate,â suggested Miss Morrison;
and each in turn tried to pronounce the
queer name, with varying success.

[59]

âI chose that name for myself when I
was four years old,â Stella went on, quite
seriously. âI was looking up through
the teepee door at the bright yellow stars
overhead. I did not like the name the
old women gave me; it is a sad name;
Ish-naÂ´-nee-unÂ´-lahâThe-One-who-was-left-Alive!â

Everybody was listening eagerly, for
the brave little exile seldom spoke of herself
unless in answer to a direct question,
and a curious sort of dignity that she had
about her forbade too close questioning.
Now it seemed that the unspoken comradeship
of the hour had unloosed her
tongue, and something, too, of the softness
and quiet pathos of the late November
afternoon had crept into her expressive
voice.

She raised her eyes to the four
sympathetic faces that were gazing
straight into her own, and the color
[60]

rose under her clear, dark skin as she
asked:

âShall I tell you how they came to give
me that sad name?â

âOh, do!â âTell us, tell us!â chorused
the girls; but Ethan sat a little apart,
and seemed absorbed in whittling a stick
that he had picked up under the great pine.

âYou have all heard of the fight at
Wounded Knee?â began Yellow Star.
âPerhaps you know how they foughtâtroops
in uniform with big guns, against
women and children and men whose guns
had been taken from them?â (They
nodded gravely.) âWell, it was three
days after the fight that a party went out
from the agency, eighteen miles away,
to bury the dead Indians. The agency
doctor went with them, and it was he
who found wrapped in blankets, in her
dead motherâs arms, and lying partly
covered with snowâfor there had been
[61]

a snow-storm on the day beforeâa little
baby, alive and crying.

âThey threw the motherâs body into
the great pit with more than a hundred
others; but a kind woman of the camp
took the baby home and fed and took care
of it. That baby was me!

âThat is why I do not know who my
father and mother were, or whether I
have a single relation in this world.
There is no way to find out, for nearly all
my fatherâs band were killed by the
soldiers on that day, and there were
many babies who died, and no one knows
who I am. And that is why the old
women called me The-One-who-was-left-Alive!â

That was all. A very simple little
story, very quietly told; but somehow
no one who heard it had much to say.
With one accord they all got up from the
mossy log and set out for home. Presently
[62]

they began to talk again about
other things, and even to laugh as lightly
as before. Just as they parted, Ethan
slipped into Yellow Starâs hand the thing
he had shaped with his knife from a
splinter of pine while she told her story.
It was a little, five-pointed star.

[63]

CHAPTER V

IN WOLCOTTâS WOODS

âFor the land sakes!â exclaimed
Grandma Brown, knitting faster
and faster, as was her wont when
disturbed in mind. âWhy donât that
Parker girlâs mother let her dresses down,
I want to know? âPears to me her legs
get longer anâ longer every day! I see
her tearinâ down the hill a spell ago, with
that outlandish dog oâ hers in full chase,
and all I could think of was a hen-turkey
with its wings spread out, tryinâ
to get away from a fox.â

âWhy, mother! Cynthia is only a
little girl,â observed Dorisâ mother, in
quiet amusement.

âSame age as our Doris, ainât she?
When I was young, gals was women at
[64]

fourteen, anâ expected to quit playinâ
with the boys, wear their dresses to their
shoe-tops anâ be pretty-behaved.â

âI wish motherâd let me wear
my

dresses to the tops of my shoes,â put in
Doris, demurely. âIâm three months
older than Cynthia, anyway.â She had
opened the sitting-room door just in time
to hear the last speech, but was careful
not to commit herself to the rest of her
grandmaâs program.

âYou all going out to your uncleâs
place again to-day, Doris?â asked her
mother, indulgently. âI see Cynthiaâs
here, but where are the others?â

âOh, Stella had her Saturday work to
do, and couldnât get âround before two
oâclock, she said. Itâs most that, now,â
and she turned again to the window. No
one was in sight except Cynthia and
Scotty, who were joyously running races
up and down the yard.

[65]

Here Mother Brown disappeared into
the pantry, possibly to put up a bag of
her fat, brown cookies, and Doris hunted
in the hall closet for her white sweater,
while Grandma commented shrewdly:

âThat galâs more of a woman than any
the rest of ye, if she
is
an Injun.â

âWolcottâs Woodsâ had become a
favorite resort since that Thanksgiving
ramble which had brought the three
friends closer together, and the fact that
the woods belonged to Dorisâ Uncle Si,
together with the further consideration
that the ânew teacherâ usually went
with the girls, had satisfied their respective
mothers of their safety on these
excursions. There was talk of snow-shoes
and skis, and later of fishing-rods
and flower-baskets, but just what went
on in Wolcottâs Woods no one knew
exactly, for the âClover-Leafâ was a
secret society of three, with Ethan Honey,
[66]

Miss Morrison and Uncle Si as honorary
members.

Presently Stella and her teacher appeared,
and the four set out at onceâor five,
counting in the irrepressible Sir
Walter, whose care-free bark voiced the
adventurous spirit of the holiday party.
It was a warm Saturday in Aprilâone
of the few days when our New England
spring really opens her heart to the wayfarer,
and from time to time they were
overtaken by country teams whose occupants
gazed curiously, even pityingly,
upon them. Once a farmer returning
homeward with an empty lumber wagon
offered the whole party âa lift,â which
proposal was gracefully evaded by Miss
Morrison. It always amused her to note
that the ânativesâ evidently could not
conceive of any oneâs walking for pleasure,
or indeed walking at all, unless he were
frankly too poor to ride.

[67]

âLetâs go round to the house, first,â
whispered Doris, hanging to Miss Morrisonâs
arm, when they were almost there.
The child had a coaxing way with her
that was not easy to resist; and, moreover,
Uncle Siâs late russet apples were
not to be despised at this time of the year.
So they all wandered up to the side door
of the low, white farmhouse, with the
square, forbidding front and homely, inviting
back premises characteristic of its
type.

The door into the summer kitchen
stood wide open, and an inquisitive hen
or two had actually crossed the threshold;
yet repeated knocks brought no answer.
Cynthia and Scotty had already dashed
off in the direction of the barn-yard, from
which there presently came sounds so
suggestive of rustic revelry that the
others precipitately followed.

âI told him he didnât dast to ride one
[68]

oâ the cows,â shrieked Sin, faint with
laughter, âand heâs done it! Look, oh,
look! Itâs as good as the circusâbetter!â

Even Miss Morrison couldnât resist
the spectacle of Ethan Honeyâs long legs
gripping the sides of his reluctant horned
steed, his face wearing a smile of mingled
triumph and embarrassment as he was
borne at a gallop round and round the
enclosure, with Scotty yapping delightedly
at his heels. In another minute or
so, without slackening his speed, the
young man had alighted quite informally
at their feet. He rose and felt mechanically
for his cap, which had disappeared,
while he gravely remarked:

âYour house is quite finished. I think
I saw a âFor Rentâ sign in the window
to-day!â

The great secret was out! The trio
of friends had early felt the common
[69]

need of a tangible house oâ dreams, and
now the primitive shelter they craved
had taken shape in Uncle Siâs hospitable
woods, and chiefly under Ethanâs capable
and willing hands.

âLetâs go right over now and have
our housewarming,â demanded practical
Doris. âWhereâs Uncle Si?â

âHe went to the store right after
dinner,â Ethan answered, âand Iâll have
plenty of time to finish my chores after
you go. Iâve been helping afternoons
and Saturdays for quite a while. Would
any of you care for a drink of fresh buttermilk?
I churned this morning.â

Well, there are worse things than the
soothing acid of that velvet drink to
wash the dust from oneâs throat after a
three-mile tramp. It wasnât many minutes
before Ethan was leading the way
to the woods, his pockets sagging with
apples, while Sin had stuffed her sailor
[70]

blouse, and Dorisâ sweater was quite
knobby with the same.

There were more shrieks of rapture,
naturally, when the girls spied their
ingenious shack of fresh-cut evergreen
boughs, which had been thrust into the
ground in a circle and cleverly interlaced
so as to make the hut all but water-tight.
There was an opening left for a doorârather
small, it is true, but still satisfactoryâwith
another, smaller and
higher up, for a window; and so neat
and careful had been the young
builderâs craftsmanship that the ferns on
the threshold were scarcely more disturbed
than they might have been by
the nest-building of a bird.

The party stooped one by one to the
oval door, and exclaimed over the fascinations
of the shadowy interior, which
reminded Yellow Star vividly of the
conical wigwams of her people. The little
[71]

house was quite bare and empty, and
redolent of the scent of fern and pine.

âWe ought to have a couch of fir-balsam,â
suggested Miss Morrison, who
had spent a summer in the Adirondacks.

Cynthia proposed an armful of thick
moss, while ease-loving Doris declared
that for her part she preferred to bring
out a hammock.

âWhat makes you so quiet, Jibby?â
demanded Sin, as they stepped forth into
the open, under the skyey roof.

âI feel in my heart what I have no
words to say,â murmured the Indian girl.

âOur neighbors would be quite as well
pleased, perhaps, if we were all as quiet
as Stella,â suggested Ethan, quickly.

âWhat neighbors do you mean? Uncle
Si doesnât care how much noise we make,â
remarked literal Doris.

âNo; but my oven-bird does,â and
the boy pointed out a shy, golden-crowned
[72]

bird that was apparently reconnoitering
the gay party with some anxiety,
from behind a sheltering clump of laurel.

âIs its nest near by?â âOh, show us,
do!â came from one and another.

The nest was a curious one, oven-shaped,
as the birdâs name would suggest,
with an opening at the side through
which the first of four speckled eggs
could be dimly seen. But Ethan would
not allow them to come too near, or linger
too long. The little mother was already
uttering cries of distress, and feigning
lameness to draw them away from her
treasure.

âHow is your crow doing?â queried
Miss Morrison, as they all sat down on
the threshold of their âHouse in the
Woodsâ to christen it with the first
social meal. It had been settled that
there was to be a stone hearth laid for
coffee-boiling before the next Saturday.

[73]

âFine,â Ethan responded, throwing an
apple high in the air, and catching it
skilfully as it fell. âHe can walk âmost
as well as ever, and eats out of my hand.
Iâm thinking of slitting his tongue and
teaching him to talk,â he added.

âEthan found a young crow with his
leg broken, by stone-throwing boys, probably,
and set it quite successfully,â the
teacher explained to Stella, who glowed
visibly, but said nothing.

âWell, Doctor, I promise to send for
you next time I fall out of the cherry-tree,â
crowed Sin, whose climbing days
were by no means over, in spite of Grandma
Brown.

âUncle Si is getting ready to go to
bed by this time, and we ought to be
going home to supper,â announced Doris,
soberly, as the April sun dropped into a
bank of haze in the quiet west.

ââSilas Wolcott is dreadful sot,â as
[74]

Grandma Brown says,â chimed in Ethan.
âManyâs the time heâs been offered a
good price, in hard cash, for this bit of
pine, but his answer is always the same.
âItâs been in the family for quite some
time: I guess I wonât sell just yet.â

âYou know, donât you, that heâs never
missed being in his bed by seven oâclock
in the evening, winter or summer, for
forty years? Thatâs just one of his little
ways. Heâs got lots of them; oneâs
drinking buttermilk three times a day,
and another is never setting foot inside a
church. I forget how that started, but
they say he stood just outside an open
window at Dorisâ motherâs wedding!
But for all that heâs a good-hearted old
chap as ever lived, and I wish he was
my

uncle,â the boy ended, honestly enough.

And the stranger, who was already
forgetting her strangeness, secretly echoed
the wish.

[75]

âOh, these dear, real people!â she said
to herself, as they all turned homeward
together, leaving the darling House in the
Woods to its invisible neighbors and companions
of the night. âThey are all soâso

folksy
, as Grandma Brown says.
It really does begin to seem as if I

belonged
!â

[76]

CHAPTER VI

A WILD WEST PERFORMANCE

âOh, Doris, darling! how can I bear
it? The very meanest, disappointingest
thing that ever happened
in this world! Oh, oh!â and poor
Sin threw herself face downward on the
grass in Doctor Brownâs back yard and
sobbed tumultuously. All of her friendâs
blandishments were of no effect, and she
remained dead to the world until Scottyâs
cold nose poked inquisitively into her
ear aroused her at last. Springing to
her feet, she rebuked him with energy,
and only then consented to retail her
woes.

âBuffalo Billâs coming to Westwood
next week, and will you believe it, mother
wonât take me! Says itâs too hot, and
[77]

circuses and such things always give her
a headache. And you know itâs been the

dream of my life
to see Buffalo Bill!
There now, Doris Brown, see if you
wouldnât cry!â

âUm, um,â was all Doris said, for she
was a maid of action rather than of many
words. The case, as it seemed to her,
was by no means hopeless, but she reserved
her judgment.

Having had her cry out and relieved
her feelings, Cynthia was soon engaged
in a boisterous game with Sir Walter
and an old tennis-ball that he had rooted
out of some hiding-place or other, while
canny Doris slipped into the house and
shortly returned with a plate full of
Mother Brownâs famous raisin cookies,
and a piece of news that quite electrified
her impulsive friend.

âMother says, if your motherâll let
you go with us, sheâll take a party to
[78]

Westwood to the matineeâyou anâ me
anâ Stella anâ Ethan anâ Miss Morrison
too, if she wants to go,â she calmly
stated.

And so it fell out that on the appointed
Saturday afternoon in July, a radiantly
happy party of six occupied seats in the
big tent; the three girls looking their
prettiest in simple white frocks, Ethan
solemn as an owl in glasses and a natty
linen suit, and good Mrs. Brown sweltering
in the inevitable black dress of village
propriety, but all alike absorbed in the
stirring spectacle.

The Rough Riders of all nations and
costumes; the wonderful rifle-shooting of
the short-skirted, sombreroed cow-girl,
the hair-raising hold-up of the ancient
stage-coachâeach and all yielded a
separate thrill; but of course the best of
all were the Indiansâreal, painted,
plumed, ferocious warriors and daring
[79]

horsemen of the plains! Everybody drew
a long breath when they galloped into the
arena.

âDoesnât it make you think of home?â
whispered Cynthia to Stella, with characteristic
frankness speaking out what the
others had only thought.

âWell, you see,â objected Yellow Star,
âour men all dress like farmers now, and
âmost all wear their hair short.
I
never
saw anything like this beforeâexcept
once on a Fourth of July, when some
white people paid our Indians to dress up
and give a war-dance.â

âButâbut they used to dress this
way?â faltered Sin, rather taken aback,
while the rest pricked up their ears.

âWell, not when they went to war,
anyway. They wouldnât want to be
bothered with all those fixings if they
really had to ride far, or fight, or anything
like that. I think, myself, they only
[80]

dressed up at councils and dances, and
maybe not quite so much, even then,â
(with just a flicker of a smile.) âI know
one thing: lots of those beaded things
are not Sioux.â

âNot Sioux, my dear! Why, what do
you mean?â wondered Mrs. Brown.

âYou see, Mrs. Brown,â explained
Stella, âmost of these very men are Sioux
from our agency. I used to hear Father
Waring and the agent talking about the
show people. There are men at home,
and a few women, that have been all
over this country and in England and
France and Germany. One of them
brought home a German wife who didnât
know a word of our language, and he
couldnât speak German, either!

âNow, here they are, dressed up in all
the beaded things they could make or beg
or borrow from some other tribeânot
Sioux at all! To us, that looks as if you
[81]

wore a firemanâs boots and trousers and
a priestâs cassock and a soldierâs hat,â she
suggested, with another little quirk at
the corners of the serious mouth, but
subsided when she observed that several
people beside their own party were listening
with evident interest.

After the performance, four or five of
the Indians passed out among the audience,
and as they approached the Laurel
party, Yellow Star gazed earnestly into
their painted faces. She recognized
several, but hesitated to speak to these
men, whom, as a modest young girl of her
people, she would not have thought of
addressing at home, much as she longed
to hear again the dear accents of her
mother tongue.

At last, however, there came a woman
with a child on her back, in its gorgeously
beaded cradle, attracting the lionâs share
of interest and attention. Many gave
[82]

the mother a bit of silver in return for the
privilege of a peep at its tiny face, or for
one of the highly colored photographs she
offered. When she actually held one out
to Yellow Star among the rest, the girl
couldnât help murmuring, in the soft
syllables of their native Dakota:

âOh, I am so glad to see you! Donât
you know me? I am from home, too; I
am The-One-who-was-left-Alive!â

The woman stared, then seized Stellaâs
hands eagerly and burst into a flood of
low-voiced dialect. The two unconsciously
made a picture which was
thoroughly appreciated by several of the
bystanders. The tall, slim girl in her
virginal white frock and modest hat,
with the big, black bow tying up her
heavy braids of hair, stood glowing all
over her expressive face and quite forgetting
her shyness, while the sad and
rather stolid countenance of the gaudily
[83]

attired stranger softened and brightened
wonderfully at the sight of a friend.

âOh, the dear baby!â cooed Yellow
Star, presently, lifting a corner of the
shawl and looking closely at the little
olive face. âBut he doesnât look well!â
she exclaimed, anxiously.

âHe is sick for two days now, and I
know not what to do, for we must travel
all time and it is so bad for him,â grieved
the mother, looking at her with the pleading
black eyes of a hurt animal. âMy
husband, Young Eagle, he say it is nothing;
but me, I not like to dress him up
and take around for the white people to
stare at when he is sick.â

âTake him back to your tent, now, or
wherever you stay, and bring Young
Eagle to me. I will talk to him,â flashed
Yellow Star, and she turned to her party
with an impulsive:

âI must go with her for a little while,
[84]

please: she is my friend; she is in trouble
and among strangers.â

âIâll go with you, dear,â put in Miss
Morrison, quickly. âWe will meet you
at the station, Mrs. Brown; or noâI
must take an earlier train; but there is
time to go with Stella and the baby
firstââ and before any one could
speak they were all three lost in the
crowd, followed by admiring and envious
glances from Cynthia and Doris,
who fancied that a glimpse behind the
scenes must hold more of wonder and
romance than all the rest.

Neither Stella nor her teacher was at
the station when the others arrived, and
after a thorough search took the 5.40
train, remembering that Miss Morrison
had said something about an engagement,
and having to leave early, and in
any case she would surely have kept
Stella with her.

[85]

Great was the consternation, therefore,
when they reached Laurel and found that
Mrs. Waring had seen or heard nothing
of her âlittle girl,â while a telephone
message to Miss Morrison disclosed the
fact that she had been obliged to hurry
away and leave Stella with her new-found
friends, who were to see that she met her
party at the station in time for the 5.40.

The long, hot, dusty day was sinking
into twilight, and the precious waif last
seen with a travelling show, in a strange
city twenty miles from home! Miss
Morrison was conscience-smitten, Lucy
Waring in tears, in which Cynthia and
Doris were quite ready to join, and poor
Mrs. Brown all but overcome by this
unexpected ending to their exciting day.

There was no train for Westwood that
night. Of course, there were always the
telegraph and telephone, but no one knew
just how to reach any responsible person,
[86]

or even whether the âWild Westâ
might not be already on its way to Hartford
or elsewhere. That, Miss Sophia
said, was in all probability the case.

âYou may be sure,â she announced,
with her usual cold precision, âthat the
wretched child has run away with the
show. What else could you expect, indeed,
after deliberately putting her in the
way of temptation? You will remember
that I advised against it from the first.
The sight of the beads and feathers and
all the rest of the savage finery was too
much for her, no doubt, and she will be
exhibiting herself in them, if possible,
this very evening. Perhaps this painful
incident may convince you, my dear
Lucy, that you can not make a silk purse
out of a sowâs ear!â

After all, the only person to keep all
his wits about him in this emergency was
Ethan Honey. That youth stopped to
[87]

consult nobody, but hastily recollecting
that an express train for Westwood
stopped at the next town, three miles off,
in twenty minutes, he felt in his pockets
to assure himself that he had just money
enough for the fare, sprang on his bicycle
and was off. Breathless and dusty, he
arrived barely in time to turn the wheel
over to the agent and board the express,
which landed him at eight oâclock in the
evening, anxious, supperless and penniless,
among the flaring lights of the big
town.

[88]

CHAPTER VII

BEHIND THE SCENES

The corner of the big sleeping-tent
allotted to Young Eagle and his
wife and baby was untidy enough,
with a smell of paints and grease and
buckskin on the hot, close air. Dexterously
Yellow Star rolled the baby out
of his heavy, beaded cradle and took him
in her arms.

He was quiet, even for an Indian baby;
unnaturally quiet, she thought; and
there was a pinched look about the tiny,
expressionless features that went straight
to her heart.

He was quiet, even for an Indian baby; unnaturally quiet,
she thought.
Page 88.

The mother had gone at once to look
for Young Eagle, so that for the minute
she and Miss Morrison and the baby were
all alone in this strange, confused place.
[89]

There was no chance to sit down, even,
and altogether it was queer and uncomfortable.

âThey must have a doctor at once,â
pronounced Miss Morrison. Then she
fidgeted a little, and looked at her watch.

âWhat shall we do, dear?â she exclaimed.
âI have only just time to
catch my train if I start at once; and I

must
get back early. Yet I donât know
how to leave you here by yourself.â

âBut I am quite safe,â Stella answered,
rather absently, her soft eyes on the sick
babyâs apathetic face. âYoung Eagle
can take me to the station to meet the
others.â

âThen donât fail to get there by half-past
five, and wait for them in the small
waiting-room. If they get a good doctor,
it will be all right. Youâre sure
you wonât come with me? Then good-by,
dear.â And Stella was left alone.

[90]

After long minutes, during which she
did what little she could for babyâs comfort,
the young husband and wife appeared,
he looking rather sulky and
shamefaced, but nevertheless yielding to
the peremptory orders, issued in crisp
Dakota, of the tall, grave-faced girl in
White, who had thrown off her hat and
was taking full command of the situation.
Blue Earth obediently washed some of the
vermilion from her round cheeks, and
rolled up a corner of the tent to let in the
fresh air, crooning over all her troubles
meanwhile to this strangely sympathetic
listener, who seemed, with the unexpected
demand upon her, to have grown
years older in the last hour.

When the doctor came at last, it was
already too late for the train; but that
Yellow Star did not realize at once. To
tell the truth, she had forgotten all about
Laurel for the time being, and was back
[91]

among the simple, lovable, swarthy folk
of her earliest recollections. She listened
intently to the doctorâs words, which she
interpreted with care and intelligence.

âNow, Doctor,â said she, after administering
the first spoonful of medicine
with her own hand, and giving the docile
young mother her final instructions, âif
you will come with me and Young Eagle,
please, we must find the man in charge
and tell him that Blue Earth and the
baby can not be in the show again until
he is well.â

The child had entirely forgotten herself,
and her Laurel friends would have
been astonished to see her thus taking the
lead and calmly laying down the law to
strange men, both white and red.

When she returned from her interview,
bringing with her the âbossâsâ promise
that the woman and child should not
be required to appear for three days, or
[92]

longer if necessary, supper was served,
and she gravely accepted her share of the
bread and ham and a thick cup filled with
steaming coffee. They ate and drank, sitting
upon upturned boxes and still talkingâtalking
in soft elisions of home and
the free winds and open skiesâhome
and the childhood scenes that seemed
already so far away.

It was dark now; eight oâclock, and the
evening performance had begun. Stella
learned that the last train for Laurel
would leave in an hour, but she had no
escort, not even to the station. Everybody
was in the show-tent except Blue
Earth, and she could not leave the baby.
Besides, she knew even less than did our
little girl of the mazes of the city streets.
She must soon set out alone to inquire
her way; and with the thought, for the
first time that day, she felt a thrill of
something like fear.

[93]

Suddenly a familiar face, atop of a tall,
boyish figure, appeared around a pile of
boxes. It was Ethan, who fairly beamed
with relief when he caught sight of her,
though he only said:

âWell, little girl, are you about ready
to go home?â

âOh, yes!â she cried, springing eagerly
to her feet. âOh, have you really been
waiting for me all this time, Ethan? How
kind of you!â and her puzzled eyes
rested for a moment upon his mussed
linen suit, and then flitted over the strong
features, somewhat sharpened by worry
and fatigue.

But Ethan did not explain, and Stella
was slowly, very slowly, emerging from
her dream. There were few words exchanged
between the two, as they made
their way through back streets to the
railway station, after an undemonstrative
farewell between the two girls who, in
[94]

everything but the common heritage of
race, were so very far apart.

Once Ethan asked her if she had
had any supper; and again, rather
anxiously, it seemed, whether she had
money enough for her ticket.

âOh, yes!â she said at once, handing
him her little purse with the ticket and
two or three dollars in silver.

He left her for a few minutes in the
ladiesâ waiting-room, and after he had
seen her to the brilliantly lighted train
and found her a seat, he handed back the
purse.

âI took out fifteen cents, to telephone
Mrs. Waring,â he carefully explained.
âShe will meet your train at Laurel.
Now you are all right, arenât you? You
arenât afraid to travel alone, are you?
Itâs less than an hour, you know.â

âBut what about you, Ethan?â she
wondered. âYouâre coming, too, arenât
[95]

you?â and she instinctively made room
for him beside her, as the train began
slowly to glide out of the station.

âI canât,â he answered, briefly.
âGood night, Stella!â and next moment
he had swung himself off the step and
disappeared in the darkness.

It was seventeen miles through the
whispering summer night to the little
station where he had left his wheel. He
reached it soon after the midnight freight,
and found the station agent awake,
mounted and rode the rest of the way
home, where the first thing he did was
to rummage in the pantry for the materials
of a satisfactory supper, and the
next, to go to bed and sleep âround the
clock.

âI couldnât borrow from a girl, you
know,â was all Ethan said, when questioned
about his midnight tramp. âAnd
besides, it was great. Such a lark!â

[96]

To himself he said: âI shall never
forget the talking leaves, the wood
smells, the company of the stars.â

Stella came fully to herself on the short
ride home, and was all tender repentance
and self-blame when she fell into the arms
of her kind foster-mother, on the deserted
platform, with the one arc-light
shivering overhead.

âOh, mother! I never thought you
might be anxious. I never thought of
people looking for me. Iâm afraid I
never thought of anything but the poor
little sick babyâand Blue Earth in
such trouble, among strange white people.
I wanted to help.â

âYes, darling; mother understands.
And you are safe home, now, thanks to
that dear, bright boy. We wonât say any
more about it,â answered gentle Lucy
Waring.

[97]

But, although nothing more was saidâfor
Lucy had contrived somehow to
silence even Miss SophiaâStella seemed
to everybody a good deal older, after
her Wild West adventure. She was now
nearly fifteen, and the eager, child-like
wish
to belong
was already partly obscured
by the more womanly and deeper desire

to help
. She wrote to Blue Earth, in
their own tongue, and received in the
course of a week or two a soiled scrawl in
reply, saying only that the baby was well
now. There seemed nothing more to be
done for them, or for any of her own
peopleânot just now, at any rateâand
the girl set herself in good earnest to be
a real help to the kind people of her
adoption.

So she rose an hour earlier every morning,
and quietly took upon herself more
of the burden of household duties, turning
them off so dexterously that Lucy Waring,
[98]

who had failed perceptibly in the
past year, accepted the relief almost unconsciously,
and even Miss Sophia had
no open fault to find.

âIf I could only please Miss Sophia,â
grieved Yellow Star. âBut I know I
never can, for I canât change myself into
something else. She dislikes me because
I am Indian,â was the unspoken thought,
and it cut deep.

[99]

CHAPTER VIII

THE RIGHT STUFF

When September came round,
Stella entered the old academy
with Doris and Cynthia and
the rest, and found a new and absorbing
world opening before her. Laurel academy
was an endowed school, and a really
good one, with better-paid teachers
and more up-to-date equipment than the
little town could have provided out of its
own slender resources.

Ethan had been duly graduated and
was going away to college, where for
two or three momentous years the girls
were seldom to see him, since he was
âworking his way through,â and found
it necessary to devote the long vacations
to more paying, though not half so
[100]

pleasant things as doing âchoresâ for
kind old Uncle Si.

The girls had now fairly entered upon
a period of life in which boys cease to be
âhorrid things,â and girls are no longer
considered âtoo silly for anything,â and
it soon became evident that, of the
three friends, Doris was by far the most
mature socially. She was undoubtedly
a pretty girl, with big blue eyes, fascinating
hair of an amber tint, and a skin
like a rose-leafâa belle and a flirt in
her demure, village fashion long before
her sixteenth birthday.

Cynthia, to her languid motherâs discontent,
but her fatherâs secret satisfaction,
was at the same age a long-limbed,
lanky, boyish-looking girl, with
decidedly boyish manners, and only the
frankest and least flattering interest in
the ruder sex. As for Stella, the country
youths admired her from a distance,
[101]

while she, for her part, had no time for
them.

âI do despise long skirts; they get in
your way so!â Sin complained, as the
three were scaling a friendly stone wall
on a pleasant Saturday in the following
spring, taking their favorite âshort cutâ
to Wolcottâs Woods.

The others laughed. âYou do act just
like a boy in petticoats,â reproved Doris.
âYou donât seem to know how to manage
them a bit. Thereâyouâre caught
again!â as Cynthia sprang recklessly
from the top of the wall, to the accompaniment
of a sharp sound of rending
cloth.

âI donât care!â Sin was bent on
braving the matter out, and, to her
friendsâ horror, she calmly tore off a long
strip of blue serge and threw it away.
âNonsense; I never mend. Daddyâll
give me a new skirt out of the store any
[102]

time I ask him. I hate clothes, and I
hate sewing. Iâm sure I donât know why
I was born a girl.â

âWhat shall you wear to the dance?â
asked Doris of Stella, as they strolled
lovingly side by side. Cynthia, her
friends thought, was in a mood that
would best be ignored.

âMy dotted swiss, I suppose; do you
think it will do?â

âMother is making me a new silk
muslinâpale blue; and Iâve got a sash
to match and new slippers. Itâs two
inches longer than my last.â Dorisâ
voice was full of innocent satisfaction.
âYou look perfectly stunning in white,
Stella,â she added, generously. âAnd
youâre the best dancer of anybody in
our set. Isnât she, Sin?â

Mrs. Waring had insisted upon giving
Stella two terms of dancing lessons, with
the others, much to her sisterâs disgust;
[103]

and here the native grace of the Indian
girl stood her in good stead. It must
be admitted that, if she did not particularly
care for boys, she did love
dancing; it was almost like flying, she
thought.

âUm, hâm,â assented Sin, who was
born without a sense of rhythm, and never
seemed to know what to do with her arms
and legs. âI donât see what either of
you want to dance for, though; I hate
it, myself. Catch me going to their old
party! Give me a warm corner and an
interesting story, when itâs too dark to go
out. Scotty! Come here at onceâhere,
sir!â

But, as usual, the obstreperous Sir
Walter declined to budge, and his mistress
found it necessary to follow up and
forcibly detach him from a promising
burrow.

âWhat a tom-boy she is! I donât
[104]

believe Sin will
ever
grow up,â Doris
lamented. âAre you looking for anything
in particular to-day, Jibby, dear?â

âTrailing arbutus for Miss Sophia. I
believe sheâd rather have it than anything;
and you know that little warm nook in
the pines, south of our House in the
Woods? It
ought
to be out, just there,â
answered Yellow Star, eagerly, looking as
if she would coax the pale buds open with
the warm shining of her dusky face.

âToo early; and besides, I donât see
why youâre always wanting to do something
special for that cross old maid,
Jibby,â objected Sin, who had come back
within ear-shot. â
She
never does anything
for
you
, does she? Iâm going to get
some flowers for Dorisâ mother, if there
are any. Her cookies are awfully good.â

âI shall take mine to Miss Morrison,â
observed Doris. âBut Iâve got to go
round by Uncle Siâs first; mother said he
[105]

wasnât feeling very well the last she heard,
and she told me to be sure and stop. Will
you come too, girls, or would you rather
go on?â

âI will come,â agreed Stella, at once.

âI wonât, then,â remarked Sin, who
was unusually contrary to-day, the others
thought. âI canât bear sick people, and
he may be awfully sick for all we know!
And then, you never can tell what Uncle
Si is going to say next.â

It was quite true. You never could
tell; and his first words to-day made
both girls jump, coming unexpectedly,
as they did, in Uncleâs small, squeaky
voice, through the open window of the
âkitchen chamber,â where he always
slept.

âLook out for the bull, gals! Dunno
âzactly where he is, but heâs certain on the
rampage, ânâ
I
canât do a thing. Been
under the weather these two days. No,
[106]

no breakfast, nor supper neither; didnât
want it bad enough to git up ânâ git it.
Whatâs that, Doris? Waâal, the door
ainât locked, if ye
will
come in.â

In five minutes Stella had a brisk fire
going in the kitchen stove, and in ten
more the tea-kettle was singing cheerily,
toast made, tea put to draw, and two
fresh eggs from the hay-mow âcoddledâ
to perfection. She had been well trained
in waiting upon a fussy would-be invalid.

Doris had found her uncle lying, fully
dressed, upon the bed, covered with a
gay patchwork quilt, and looking worried
and feverish. She succeeded in arranging
his pillows and putting the room
to rights before the arrival of the tray;
and while Stella deftly helped the old
man to take some nourishment, Doris
prudently closed both doors and telephoned
to her mother.

[107]

âThere! sheâll see that heâs taken care
of properly, if he
is
âqueer as Dickâs hat-band,â
as Grandma says,â observed his
niece. âSheâs always saying that âfor
a man to live alone as he does and cook
his own vittles is flyinâ in the face of
Providence,â and she âhasnât no manner
of doubt that Silasâll be found dead in
his bed, some fine morning.â Well, I
hope not, Iâm sure! Now we must go
right away and find Cynthia; no telling
what mischief
sheâs
up to, by this time.â

âOr the bull, either,â thought Yellow
Star; but she said nothing, for she knew
her friendâs weakness. In the excitement
of taking care of Uncle Si, his niece had
forgotten all about the bull. If not,
Stella knew well that poor Cynthia
would be left to her fate, so far as timid
Doris was concerned. Why, even the
most harmless cow that ever lowed would
send her flying from the huckleberry
[108]

pasture, and folks said the Wolcott bull
was dangerous.

So only one of the girls kept a sharp
lookout as they passed the open barn-yard
gate and crossed the pasture toward
Wolcottâs Woods. On its distant verge,
a fleck of scarlet showed plainlyâCynthiaâs
old red cape. Andâyes! A
lumbering, dark shape had already started
leisurely in pursuit of the scarlet fleck.

Stella saw the bull first, and walked on
faster. Then Doris saw, grew white as
a sheet and instantly turned to run,
oblivious of the fact that Taurus had his
back toward them, and his eye too
evidently upon Cynthia.

âHelp! help!â she screamed, as she
fled; but there was neither house nor
man within half a mile.

Stella resolutely advanced, keeping
close to the wire fence that separated the
big pasture from their much-loved woods.
[109]

Cynthia had discovered her danger and
was running gallantly, but had not
thought to drop her red cape. And she
had been caught in the open field, far
from fence or tree. Sir Walter had left
her side, and was barking hoarsely and
making little ineffectual dashes at the
bull, that, together with her headlong
flight, merely served to provoke his
curiosity into wrath. Giving a terrifying
bellow, he set off at full speed.

Yellow Star had seen much of wild
Texas cattle at the agency, where they
are issued to the Indians âon the hoof,â
as a monthly ration. Furthermore, Sir
Walter had long since learned to obey the
girl from Dakota as he never dreamed of
obeying his impetuous little mistress.
Her flute-like whistle was enough to
bring him galloping to her side. Cynthia,
too, turned half-way toward her at the
sound, stumbled and fell at full length.

[110]

The bull was still plunging heavily
along, and Stella, who had hoped to draw
him off in her direction and then slip
through the wire fence out of reach,
found scant time for any such maneuver.
Desperately she sent Sir Walter flying
back to bark and snap at his heels, while
she herself stood still and uttered a long
ringing cry.

He stumbled, half turnedâand hark!
the strange, challenging cry was repeated
again and again, until it actually brought
him to a halt but a few paces from poor
Sin, who had struggled to her feet and
was sobbing aloud as she tried to run
with a twisted ankle. And now the bewildered
animal stood pawing the sod
and bellowing in hoarse response, until
both girls had reached a place of safety.

âWell, that
was
a close call, and no
mistake!â Cynthia had quite recovered
[111]

her spirits in the course of an hour or so,
and was obviously enjoying her own importance
as the heroine of so rare an
adventure, while she nursed her sprained
ankle on the shabby cushions of Doctor
Brownâs top-buggy. Poor Doris, still
pale and tearful, was squeezed in between
Cynthia and the Doctor, while Mrs.
Brown remained in temporary charge of
her protesting brother, and Stella, who
had insisted upon walking, was already
far ahead.

The gruff Doctor assented, with an
appraising eye, meanwhile, upon the solitary
girlish figure moving so rapidly before
them, along the hilly country road.
The Doctor was not a man of unnecessary
words; but if he had spoken out
his thought just then, it would have
sounded something like this:

âThereâs the right stuff in that girlâno
question about it! I wonderââ

[112]

CHAPTER IX

GLIMPSES OF OLD AMERICA

When Uncle Si, getting âsoâs to
be âroundâ again, heard all
about Stella and the Wolcott
bull, the immediate results were two.

First, the bull was promptly soldâa
surprising occurrence to those who best
knew Silas Wolcott and his deep-rooted
objection to disposing of any âcritterâ
whatsoever that had been raised on the
home place. No fowl was too old or too
tough for home consumption, and indeed
Uncle had developed no mean skill in
softening gallinaceous tissues and imparting
a delicious flavor by braising for
twelve hours or thereabouts, with peppercorns
and sweet herbs, in an old-fashioned
bean-pot. But superfluous calves and
[113]

superannuated horses were said to owe
their immunity from sale to the fact that
they had been âborn on the old farm,â
a fact which to his mind appeared to
constitute a lifelong claim upon its
hospitality.

Consequence number two, our heroine
was actually adopted, to the extent of
being formally requested to call the old
man âUncle,â which she shyly but joyfully
proceeded to do. It was one more
milestone on her long and often lonely
road to âsome really true relations.â

Now among the strictly home-bred
stock on the Wolcott acres was a small
herd of deer, as jealously guarded and
almost as tame as if they had adorned the
stately park of some English earl. Stella
heard with intense, though undemonstrative,
interest of this unexpected renaissance
of wild life among the New
England hills.

[114]

âWhy, Mother Waring,â she confided,
âyou know theyâre almost gone from our
Dakota prairies, where there used to be
so many. Think how hard it is for the
women to get any deerskin for moccasins!
And how
can
there be deer here where
white people have lived for hundreds of
years?â

âThere werenât any when I was a
little girl,â Mrs. Waring observed. âI
believe they have come back because
for many years now they have been protected;
that means, you know, that nobody
is allowed to kill them. Seems to
me Iâve heard that there are supposed to
be several thousand in this State; and
now a law has been passed that for one
week this fall they may be shot,â she
added, doubtfully.

âUncle Si wonât have his shot,â insisted
Stella. âHe has printed signs up
all over his woods, with something about
[115]

âthe penalty of the law.â Mother, I do
so want to see a deer! and he says there
are three that come to drink at the Cold
Spring almost every evening. Weâve
seen their tracksâa buck, a doe, and a
dear little fawn,â the sweet voice pleaded.
âBut we always have to come home
early soâs to be in time for tea.â

âSo you do, darling,â assented her
foster-mother, her gentle, puzzled gaze
upon Stellaâs earnest face. She knew by
instinct that the child had a special favor
to askâshe who had always found it
hard to ask favors.

Out it came at last. âCynthia is just
as wild about the deer as I am; andâandâMother
dearâUncle Si says we
can come some Saturday and heâll show
them to us if we can keep quiet enough;
and Dr. Brown has promised to drive us
out there and backâDoris too, though
Doris is a teeny bit afraid of the old
[116]

buckâs hornsâif youâre willing, and
donât mind my being out after dark just
this once.â She was quite breathless, now.

âWhy, yes, I think soâif the Doctor
is kind enough to take charge of youââ
Mrs. Waring got no further, for the sentence
was interrupted at this point with
a strangling hug.

After Stella had actually seen the deer,
which happened before many weeks, the
four friends had an earnest discussion
upon the subject of the coming week of
slaughter.

Ethan had lately become quite an
adept with bow and arrows, which suggested
to him the bright idea of going into
the merry greenwood with the romantic
equipment of a Robin Hood or a Hiawatha.
He rather looked for the admiration
of the girls, and especially of Yellow
Star, and had even gone so far as to
picture himself triumphantly bringing in
[117]

the deer on his shoulders, and gallantly
throwing it down at Mrs. Waringâs
kitchen door. Rather to the boyâs resentment,
however, she proved most
unsympathetic.

âHow can you think of such a thing?â
she protested, âand after we have all
watched the darling things drinking out
of Uncleâs spring! I donât call it hunting
to go out and kill them when they are so
tame, almost like pets.â

âI hope you donât think I propose to
shoot on posted land,â remarked Ethan
With some dignity. âI know just where
I shall go; on the south side of the
mountain thereâs a regular deer path;
and it isnât like gunning, let me tell you,
with the buckshot scattering every which
way; and beside, the farmers down that
way are glad enough to have the deer
killedâthey do no end of damage to the
young fruit trees.â

[118]

âI should say so; why, those very
deer that Uncle Si thinks so much of got
into the garden one night, and ruined all
his early peas,â chimed in sensible Doris.
âIf it had been his next-door neighborâs
calves, wouldnât there have been a row,
or even a lawsuit, may be.â

âWell, rather,â observed Ethan, glad
of a champion. âThatâs just why the
law was passed providing for one weekâs
open season; the deer are getting to be
regular nuisances all over this part of the
state. Pretty soon the farmers will have
to build high fences to keep them off the
growing crops.â

âItâs letting them think no one is
going to hunt them, till they forget to be
afraid, and then turning an army of men
and boys loose on the poor things all
of a sudden, that
I
donât like,â broke
in Cynthia impulsively. âItâs all very
well talking about the law, but what do
[119]

the deer know about your old law? It
isnât fair, and I hate anything thatâs not
fair.â

âAnd it has seemed so like home, ever
since I knew for certain there were Wild
deer in these woods,â breathed Stella.
âGirls, I keep fancying weâll come upon
some wigwams, some time, of those old
Indians who lived here two hundred years
ago. I suppose there arenât any bounties
offered for their scalps nowadays; and
just suppose
they
should come back, like
the deer!â

The young folks were picnicking, as
usual, in the edge of that bit of first-growth
pine that Uncle was so proud of,
and at Stellaâs words all glanced furtively
about, as if half expecting to glimpse a
ragged birch-bark dwelling, or even one
of the soft-footed braves revisiting his
native haunts in these venerable woods.
After all, it was they who were the intruders.
[120]

Ethan looked decidedly shaken,
but matter-of-fact Doris remarked
bluntly:

âIf they did come back, they wouldnât
kill the deer for one week, but every day
in the year. I thought Indians were
always hunting, when they werenât on the
war-path killing people; and
you
neednât
say anything, Stella Waring, so there!â

However, when the open season
actually came round with November,
Ethan decided that he was âtoo busyâ
to take a day off in the woods, which
Stellaâs fancy had peopled for him with
stealthy shadows, and friendly wreaths
of blue smoke from well-hidden wigwams.
It was Thanksgiving before they all met
again at Uncle Siâs place, and found him
âas mad as a hatter.â

âSpent moreân half oâ that week patrolinâ
the woods with a shotgun, and givinâ
fools that couldnât read plain English a
[121]

piece oâ my mind,â he explained, grimly.
âHowsomever, the blamed racket scared
my deer soât Iâve never seen âem since,
and most likely I shaânât agin.â

âWhat a shame!â cried Sin, and poor
Stella looked too much distressed to
speak. She had tried not to think of the
timid creatures harried and wounded, of
antlered heads laid low, of the blood-drops
on the leaves.

âHave you ever noticed this big
rock in the middle of the pasture?ânoticed
it very specially, I mean,â she suggested,
as they made their way around the
giant boulder, towering high above their
heads like a rude altar. âI always think,
what if it was right here the Indians
used to make their prayers and offerings!
Great-grandfather Inyanâthatâs what
we Dakotas call a rock like that. And
there must have been water-spiritsâwhat
you call fairiesâabout uncleâs
[122]

ever-flowing spring. Oh, Cynthia and
Doris! I should think you girls would
care more about the
old
America. Youâre
proud of being Americans; and there
may be prettier stories belonging to these
very hills than those we read in school
about the Roman nymphs and the old
Norse thunder-gods.â

âBut where would we find them?â
asked Doris, much impressed.

âTry the Historical Society,â Ethan
suggested.

âIâm going straight to the library,â
proclaimed Cynthia, âand next time we
come for a day in the woods, weâll each
of us tell an âOld Americaâ story.
What do you say, girls?â

An hour later, they had scattered in
search of princess-pine and Christmas
ferns, squaw-berries and moss, and Stella,
at some little distance from the others,
[123]

was carefully lifting a clump of hepaticas
for Miss Sophiaâs fernery, when she suddenly
thought she heard a faint, whimpering
noise.

The blood fairly crinkled in her veins.
Dropping basket and trowel, she set herself
to follow up the cry which came again
and yet again, a plaintive, muffled, half-human
sound that was almost like a
babyâs smothered wail. At last her quick
eye detected a misplaced leaf. The faint
trail led straight to a dense thicket of
laurel where a small creature lay motionless,
so near the color of the dead leaves
in which it nestled that to most eyes it
would have been invisible.

With one quick spring she was upon
it, and had flung both arms around the
neck of a half-grown fawn, which had
been wounded in the side, and was too
weak to struggle much. Then she raised
her voice in a loud cry.

[124]

âEthan! Cynthia! Oh, EâEâthan!â

âItâs Stellaâs fawn, now,â piped Uncle
Si Wolcott. They were all in the big
farmhouse kitchen; Stella on the floor
with the fawnâs head on her lap, and a
saucer of milk beside her; Cynthia
swinging her long limbs from her favorite
perch on the edge of the table, and the
others standing around in admiring attitudes.
âDoctor Ethanâ had carefully
washed the wound, and pronounced it not
serious.

âThâ game wardenâs a pretty good
friend oâ mine,â he went on, with a
twinkle, âand I donât guess thereâll be
any trouble about her keepinâ it for a
pet if she wants to.â

The three girls exploded in a simultaneous
âOh!â of delight, but next
instant a look of almost laughable bewilderment
[125]

overspread their faces. The
same thought had occurred to them all
at the same time. Miss Sophia!

â
Do
you suppose sheâll let you?â
queried Sin in awestruck tones, while the
others held their breath. No one but
Cynthia would dare to say things right
out like that.

âYou might have a little house for
him, down by the chicken-coop,â quavered
Doris.

Stella was thinking hard. No one knew
how she wanted the waif for her own;
and she felt sure that dear Mother Waring
would notâcould not refuse her.
The question was, did Stella want her
to pay the price?

They were all waiting for her to speak,
and at last her clear voice broke the
silence.

âThe fawn is something like me,â it
began, pitifully. âYou see, donât you?
[126]

Itâs wild; it hasnât any relations. I
know just how a wild orphan feels, and
Iâm afraid it wouldnât want to live
in Miss Sophiaâs chicken-coop and have
her all the time wishing it wasnât there.
Uncle Si, if you would only be willing to
let the fawn stay in the barn-yard with
the calves, and if I could just
call
it
mine, and come and feed it sometimes?â

There was a soft brightness in the black
eyes, as if tears were not far off, and
everybody began talking at once, trying
to drown the thought of the two âwild
orphansâ clinging together, and the utter
hopelessness of an appeal to Miss Sophia.

âThink the critterâd be most as unpopâlar
as Ethanâs rattlesnakes, hey?â
chuckled Uncle Si.

â
What?
â screamed Doris and Cynthia,
together, and the boy blushed to the roots
of his hair.

[127]

âWell, you know, that was a long time
ago,â he muttered, but Uncle mercilessly
continued:

âSaid they waânât dangerous at all,

if ye knew how to handle âem
âpick
âem up by the scruff oâ the neck, like
blind kittens; waânât that it, Ethan?
Studied a heap on the subjick, he had.
âUncle,â says he, âthey donât need to eat
a thing fer six months to a year;â anâ
I says, âThere orter be a good bit oâ
profit in boarding âem,â says I. But
Ethan, he says as how he can get five
dollars apiece from a
mu
seum; and he
has a pair oâ boots made to come
up to his waist, pretty nigh; anâ he
tramps over to Rattlesnake Gulch one
morninâ afore daylight, so as to ketch
âem crawlinâ out oâ their holes, most
likely.â

Every eye was fixed upon the speaker,
except that of his victim, who wriggled
[128]

uneasily and vainly tried to break into
the conversation.

âEthan allers did go in fer makinâ
money, ye know,â pursued Uncle, enjoying
his success. âWouldnât take along
any whisky fer bites, though I offered
him all I had left, sayinâ as how it was a
wuss pizen than the snakeâs anâ not
accordinâ to modern methods. Wal,
along about dark Ethan comes back
pretty well tuckered out, carryinâ a
gunny-sack over his shoulder on the end of
a stick. Didnât need to tell me there
was a live rattler in that there gunny-sack!
I could hear his tail a-goinâ
like an alarm-clock, anâ every now anâ
then heâd strike out kinder vicious
anâ set the thing to wavinâ back anâ
forth.â

âHow did you ever get him into the
sack, Ethan?â begged Cynthia, much excited.
Doris shuddered, and hid her face
[129]

in her hands, while Stella sat quite silent,
with the fawnâs head in her arms.

âMischief of it was to git him out
agin,â remarked Uncle. âEf Ethan ever
got that five dollars, I will say he arned
it. Just tell âem what your aunt by marriage
said when she stumbled over that
gunny-sack in the woodshed anâ found
out what was in it, Ethan.â But Ethan
had slipped out to the barn, and was
fixing up an unused box-stall for Stellaâs
fawn.

âGone, is he? Wal, all I can say is,
Miss Sophia Russell ainât a circumstance
to Misâ Honey on that occasion. Donât
know as I blame her, neither. That
pet oâ yournâll be safe enough with your
old uncle, Stella, anâ youâll be out to tend
to it every Satâday, or Iâll know the reason
why.â

[130]

CHAPTER X

NOBODYâS LITTLE GIRL

âIt doos beat all,â declared Grandma
Brown, with even more than her
usual emphasis, âhow blind own
folks can be! Iâll lay there ainât a man,
woman nor child in Laurel township,
save anâ exceptinâ Sophiâ Spellman, that
donât know Lucyâs goinâ straight into a
decline. Weak lungs is in the famâly, to
begin with; I can recâlect when those
galsâ mother anâ aunt both went off with
the gallopinâ consumption. Like as not,
Lucy felt her husbandâs death a good deal;
anâ Iâve heerd tell how that Dakoty
climate keys you right up till ye canât live
anywheres else without snappinâ off short.

âSheâs ben goinâ down stiddy ever
sence she come back home, thatâs flat;
[131]

anâ hereâs that sister of hers tellinâ folks
as how âitâs jest a touch oâ bronchitis,â anâ
âshe only wishes
she
had Lucyâs constertution.â

âWhatâs more, she has her breakfust
in bed regâlar, so I hear, for all the world
like them ungodly folks in furrin parts,
anâ reads French novels on the sofy
while Lucy anâ Stella doos up the work.
I declare forât, Emmeline, if somebody
else donât do it pretty quick, Iâll speak to
Sophiâ myself!â

Everybody knew that Grandma had
succeeded in preserving to a good old age
all the âspunkâ and âsnapâ that seems
to have perished, for the most part, with
a past generation, and it is quite possible
that, if opportunity had served, she would
have faced down and outdone even the
formidable Miss Sophia. Lucyâs decline,
however, had been so very gradual, and
her ways so quiet and uncomplaining,
[132]

that even a sister might almost have
been forgiven for not realizing how matters
stood. As for her dear Sioux daughter,
now a head taller than herself, and
completing, to the eminent satisfaction
of her teachers, her second yearâs work in
the academy, to her it had seemed a
sufficient explanation of everything that
âmother was growing old!â For the
fifties, and even the forties, of ripe middle
age do seem âoldâ to sixteen.

After almost three years in Laurel,
Yellow Star was growing fairly certain
that she truly âbelonged.â Modest as
she was, she could not help knowing that
people liked herâall sorts of peopleâboys
and girls and babies, intimates and
strangers, sharp-tongued Grandma Brown
and the gruff-spoken Doctor and âpernicketyâ
Uncle Si. Even from Mary
Maloney and Rosey Bernstein the Indian
girl had wrung some measure of reluctant
[133]

admiration; but, in spite of much willing
service, she remained vividly conscious
of being still an outsider and an interloper
in the eyes of Miss Sophia.

Now at last Doctor Brown had been
sent for to see Lucy Waring. Everybody
in Laurel, almost, had noticed his ancient
roan steed and battered top-buggy before
the Spellman gate. It was impossible
to deny any longer, in the face of that
long-postponed confession, what all the
village tongues had been wagging with
for months past. Lucy had âtook to her
bed,â at last, and the end could not be
very far off.

It came suddenly, after all; to Yellow
Star with a suddenness almost as devastating
as that storm of bullets and shell
out of a clear sky which had left her
stranded, a nameless brown waif, on the
frozen December sod, some fifteen years
before.

[134]

The spring term had slipped quickly
away, with Miss Ward installed as nurse
and Doctor Brown calling every other
day; with Miss Sophia looking grimmer
and grayer than ever, and Lucyâs waxen
face on the pillow relaxing into a loving
smile as she repeated the daily formula
which only Stella really believed:

âI shall be better to-morrow. Now
the weather is getting so pleasant, I shall
soon be out again.â

Then, one sultry July day, after a long
âspellâ of exhausting heat, there had
come an alarming faintness and a âhurry
callâ for the Doctor. Miss Sophia was
hastily sent for from the kitchen, where
she had been taking the indignant Mrs.
Maloney to task for ânickingâ her old
blue china â¦ and presently, to poor
Stella sitting, desperately anxious and
unhappy, on the top step of the dark
stairway, just outside her foster-motherâs
[135]

door, came, not even kind-hearted Doctor
Brown, but the business-like, white-capped
nurse, with her curt message:

âMiss Sophia says you need not sit
there any longer, Stella; Mrs. Waring
is dead.â

Now, indeed, it was all Miss Sophiaâs
house, she thought; and it âpushed her
out,â as she had said once when she first
came to Laurelâpushed her away as
with actual, bodily handsâa dark-skinned
little alien, who did not âbelongâ!
All of a sudden, she realized with
dreadful sharpness that she was nothing,
really, to that gentle soul who was gone,
and who had pityingly taught the childish
lips to call her âmother.â No, she was
no Waring except in nameâmuch less
a Spellman or a Russell; those ghostly
portraits in the shuttered parlor below
disowned and despised her; she was only
[136]

a strayâa foundlingâonly The-One-who-was-left-Alive.

Yellow Star sprang up and darted
down the colonial stairway and out the
sacred front door. The graveled, box-bordered
walk echoed her flying feet,
and the elm-trees, straining against a
rising wind, seemed to peer anxiously
after the light figure as it sped by. Then
the gate clicked and she was awayâaway
on the wings of the summer windânot
walking, scarcely even running,
but
flying
toward the only near refuge her
spirit knew, the dear, green, lonely
House in the Woods!

Long before she could reach it, the
storm broke. It was a storm that made
timid Doris cower with her face hidden,
there in her own motherâs cheerful sitting-room;
even the weary Doctor thanked
his stars that he had gotten safe home and
his horse âput upâ before the rain came.

[137]

Yet it was not those silvery sheets of
hissing water, drenching to the skin all
who might be abroad, that one really
mindedânot at all! It wasâah!
the play of forked lightnings, awfully
bright, and the ear-splitting thunder-crash
that could do no harm, one knew,
but that was so dreadful for all that.
Yellow Starâs Indian blood fairly curdled
within her in the face of this close strife
of the elements; for brave as her people
truly were, the angry moods of nature
were to them full of threat and awful
personality. And yet, to-night, her grief
was such that even the forked tongues of
the âThunder Birdsâ could not really
terrify her, and she ran on.

In the rude shelter raised by friendly
hands and connected with some of the
happiest hours of her short life, there
among the grave neighbor pines hiding
their frightened nestlings, the girl from
[138]

far Dakota cried aloud in long-forgotten
Indian fashionâcried and mourned in
rhythmic cadence, wild as the sobbing
wind in the tree-topsâthere told in her
own dear tongue to those shivering sister
woods all the secrets of her storm-tossed
heart.

âOh!â she cried, standing straight up
in the tiny shack and flinging her strong
young arms above the streaming black
head with a tragic gesture, âoh, it is
worse even than when I lost my own
mother and was too young to know! I
only knew what they told meâhow
they threw my poor Dakota mother into
that awful pit, with no coffin and no
prayerâand how I could never, never
know her name or how she looked, or
whether I was all the child she ever had,
or anything! And the white manâs cruel
bullets had torn her poor body â¦ and
yet in all her pain her last thought was
[139]

for me â¦ to keep me warm and alive.
I meant to prove that I was
worth
keeping
alive â¦ and I hoped she might, somehow,
know.

âAnd then, there were those kind
Indian womenâBlue Earthâs mother,
and Mrs. Driving Hawk, and the rest,
who took care of me as well as they could.
They were poor and very frightened and
most had babies of their own, and it was
very, very kind of them to feed a useless
little fretting baby without any relations,
whose people had nearly all been killed
by the soldiers of the Great Father at
Washington.

âTo be sure, I have often heard my
dear Mother Waring say that when she
found me I was very dirty, and looked
hungry and miserable. Many of the
Dakota children who had mothers and
fathers, too, were hungry, and âmost all
were dirty, Iâm afraid, back there on the
[140]

reservation. It wasnât all their fault; I
know it wasnât.

âI was about five when Mother Waring
took me away; very thin and ugly,
and oh! so frightened of the white people!
She used to tell me about it afterward, to
make me laugh. She had my ragged little
Dakota dress and moccasins put away,
the ones I had on the day she took me
home to her house, and washed and
dressed and fed me, and put me at night
in a clean, white bed next her own. I
cried half that first night, she told me,
and begged to go back to the Indian
camp, where I might curl up in a dirty
quilt in any one of half a dozen smoky
teepees.

âThen, after awhile, I got fat and contented,
and I loved her dearly, and began
to be afraid of the Indian women.
But she wouldnât have that, either; she
always made me shake hands with them,
[141]

and wouldnât let me forget my own
language when I learned the English.
And I went to church and Sunday School
and learned about Our Father who art in
heaven; and after a great while Father
and Mother Waring seemed just like my
real father and mother on earth.

âThen dear Father Waring left us and
went to heaven, too; and we came to
Laurel to live. Itâs been beautiful here;
all but Miss Sophia. I have so many
friends in LaurelâI really did begin
to think I belongedâand if I could
only stay long enough to graduate, there
are so many things I could do.

âBut now I seem to see it all. Now
Mother Waring is gone, I havenât any
folks, anywhere. Miss Sophia doesnât
love me a single bit. There are just Doris
and her father and mother, and Cynthia
and Grandma Brown and Uncle Si
and Miss Morrisonâyes, Ethan too,
[142]

though I havenât seen him for ever and
ever so longâall just
friends
, not folks,âand
I shall be left out of everything,
again. Oh, dear! I am nobodyâs
little girl!â

After supper that same evening, when
the summer tempest had subsided to a
gentle, purring down-pour of warm rain,
and while Yellow Star, scarcely yet
missed from the gloomy house of mourning,
lay exhausted with crying on her
bed of boughs, in her wet garments,
away out in Wolcottâs Woods, her good
friends were discussing her future and
the practical bearings of her great loss,
with true village simplicity.

âItâs jest as I say, anâ you can depend
onât,â insisted Grandma Brown. âI
ainât missed a funeral in these partsânot
for forty-six yearsâthat time I
was bedfast, you recollect, Grampa? and
[143]

old Deacon Hewitt went and turned up
his toes. Furthermore, there ainât ben
a will made in Laurel all these years that
I couldnât tell ye the heft onât.

âDeacon Spellman, he left that house
anâ money in bank to his two darters,
Lucy anâ Sophiâ, anâ whichever one of
âem was to die fust the hull went to the
survivor. Youâll find out itâs so; anâ
everything belongs to Sophiâ Spellman
now, onless Lucy anâ her husband had
contrived to save suthinâ out of his pay,
which wasnât no great, it stands to reason,
him beinâ not only a minister but a
missionary to the heathen.â

âI donât know but youâre right,
mother,â the Doctor admitted, taking his
pipe out of his mouth and resting his
grizzled head on the worn leather cushions
of his chair, with a tired sigh. âI do
kind of hope, all the same, that some sort
of provision will be made for that child
[144]

to finish her schooling. I should hate to
see her packed off to the Indian reservation
now, when her heartâs set on graduating; and
Stella deserves to graduate if
ever a girl did.â

âOf course Iâm right, Ezry,â observed
Grandma, crisply. âAnd packed off
sheâll be in short order, or I miss
my

guess.â

âIt seems to me Sophia will want to do
whatâs right by her only sisterâs adopted
child,â was Mrs. Brownâs gentle suggestion,
while Doris cried quietly, with
her head buried in the sofa pillow.

âSeems to me, Emmeline,â Grandma
countered, briskly, âyouâd orter know
Sophiâ Spellman better by this time.
Sheâs her granther Spellman over again;
anybody outside the family connection
was allers the dirt under his feet, in a
manner of speakinâ. Stellaâs a good gal,
anâ a smart gal, but sheâs no kin to
[145]

Sophiâ that I know of. Anâ furthermore,
she ainât even white folks, anâ no Spellman
by birth and nater could put up
with thatânot if she had the parts of
an angel. Jest you wait anâ see.â

And, as usual, Grandma had the last
word.

[146]

CHAPTER XI

JUST FRIENDS

It was on the very day after the
funeral that Miss Sophia had an
unexpected caller, in the person of
Cynthiaâs father, the proprietor of the
largest dry-goods and grocery store in
Laurel. She privately wondered what
he had come for, but received him with
a civility as chilling as the atmosphere of
her shrouded âbest room,â and as unbending
as the tall, spare figure in its
gloom of unrelieved black.

Mr. Parker was a man of business, and
went straight to the point.

âI hope youâll excuse my calling so
soon, maâam! I should be very sorry to
intrude, but the fact is, I am particularly
[147]

interested inâah!âin a present member
of your family.â

Here Miss Sophia visibly stiffened, and
the gentleman cleared his throat, and
made a fresh beginning.

âIf I may be allowed to refer to the
prospects of yourâahem! of the late
Mrs. Waringâs charge, I understand
that it is proposed toâthat her return
to Dakota isâah!âunder consideration?â

âAs to Stella,â reluctantly responded
Miss Sophia, âI do not quite seeâbegging
your pardon, Mr. Parkerâwhy
my plans for the girl should be of
particular interest to my neighbors. However,
I have no objection to answering
your question. Stella is sixteenâquite
old enough to go to work, and, thanks
to my sisterâs possibly mistaken kindness,
has a far better education than either her
antecedents or her circumstances call for.
[148]

It is high time, in my opinion, that she
was getting in touch with her own people,
and becoming accustomed to their mode
of life, to which she has so long been a
stranger.

âHer own inheritance from an ancestry
of savages, Mr. Parker, betrays
itself in such escapades as Stella indulged
in on the night of my sisterâs death, when
she ran away to the woods in a violent
thunderstorm, was found by your dog, I
believe, and brought home after dark by
Mr. Silas Wolcott from his place on the
Bay road. Such distressing outbreaks
render it desirable, certainly, from my
point of view, that her return be not delayed
too long.â

âThatâs about as I supposed, maâam,â
gravely assented Mr. Parker, âand it is
on that understanding that I have come
here to-day to make a definite proposition
to Miss Stella, and to you, as her
[149]

guardian. It is simply this: that I offer
her a home with me, as my daughterâs
companion, for the next two years, or
until she graduates from Laurel academy.
She will be treated precisely like my own
daughter, if she comes. I shall make
her an allowance for dress, and so forth,
and of course pay all of her expenses.â

Poor Miss Sophia was taken entirely
by surprise, and had to moisten her dry
lips more than once before she could
inquire:

âAnd what, may I ask, is your reason
for thisâthis extraordinary offer?â

âMiss Stella, maâam,â responded Mr.
Parker, with unmoved politeness, âis, as
you are perhaps aware, my daughterâs
most intimate friend. Cynthia is an
only child, and, I am sorry to say, rather
a lonely one. She has her little peculiarities,
Miss Spellman, like the rest of us,
and her mother and I have every reason
[150]

to be satisfied with your wardâs influence.â
(Here Miss Sophia indulged
in an unmistakable sniff.)

âIn addition to this, my daughter
firmly believes that Miss Stella saved her
life from the Wolcott bull, not a great
while ago, which of course puts us all in
her debt; and, in short, Cynthia says
that she will not graduate without her.â
(Another sniff.) âAnd besides,â firmly
continued Mr. Parker, with perhaps a
secret enjoyment of the situation, âthe
fact is, maâam, her friends all feel that
Miss Stella is a girl ofâahem!âunusual
abilities, and ought by all means
to complete her education.â

âOf course, Mr. Parker, I shall require
some time to think this matter over.â
Miss Sophia spoke rather feebly, after a
long pause. âThe suggestion is an unexpected
one, andâandâHowever, I
shall mention it to the girl, andâBy
[151]

the way, Mr. Parker, you may not be
aware that my sister left her by will all
of her personal property, and a sum in
savings-bank amounting to something
over three hundred dollars. Stella is
not exactly an object of charity.â

The storekeeper was quite aware of
this fact, as was everybody else in the
village. The will had been drawn up
by the local lawyer, who had deemed it
necessary to keep his counsel no longer
than till the funeral was over. However,
Stellaâs friends did not think the legacy
of great importance, as bearing on the
question in hand. Three hundred dollars
was a nice little nest-egg for her, to be
sure; but it would not cover her board,
clothing and school expenses for two
years.

He simply bowed, therefore, and took
up his hat as he replied, civilly:

âCertainly, certainly, maâam; take
[152]

all the time you wish to talk the matter
over with the young lady. When you
and she have made up your minds, may
I ask that you will communicate with
me?â

At Miss Sophiaâs front door, the merchant
encountered Doctor Brown. Almost
a personal encounter it was, for the
big Doctor was in a hurry, as usual, and
had stopped in upon urgent business, on
his way to a patient. Miss Sophia was
just on the point of escaping to her room,
to consider this unprecedented interference
with her plansârank impertinence,
she was inclined to call itâwhen
he bluntly detained her.

âNo, no; I canât sit down. I shaânât
keep you a minute. Itâs just this. Stella
Waring must have her chance. She must
graduate from the academy, in the first
place, and her little bit of money wonât
do the trick. My wife and I arenât rich,
[153]

as you know, but thereâs room under our
roof for the child, especially if sheâs
willing to make herself usefulâand I
know she is, bless her heart!

âShe can come to-morrow; we need
her to wait on mother, help my wife
about the house and be company for
Doris, so sheâll give as much as she gets.
Stellaâs proud, Miss Sophia, and wouldnât
consent to be a burden to anybody. I
want her to understand that sheâll be
doing us a favor by coming. Talk it over
with her, and let me know. Good day!â

Well, there was no way out of it; the
whole matter must be laid before the girl
herself. Distasteful as the task was,
Miss Sophia must explain to her both
offers and give her her choice; yes, and
the further alternative of remaining where
she was for two years longer. Upon
mature consideration, and with her eyes
[154]

fully opened, at last, to Stellaâs position
and value in the community, this stiff-necked
elderly Puritan was compelled to
face the fact that the girlâs services were
worth as much to her as to any one else;
and the further fact that it would not
âlook well,â in the eyes of her lifelong
neighbors and townsfolk, if her dead
sisterâs foster-child should be obliged to
find another home in Laurel. She could
scarcely be packed off to the reservation
willy-nilly; not with such influential
friends on her side.

Besides, it would be
some
satisfaction
to get the better of that scheming Mr.
Parker. Let him take his own medicine,
and see how he liked it. And besides,
when you really came down to it, what
would she, Miss Sophia, do without her
light-handed and swift-footed little attendant?
Poor Lucy was gone, and
Stella was the only one, now, who knew
[155]

all their ways. Must she be at the mercy
of a Mrs. Maloney in her old age? So for
hours she sat and thought till her old
head fairly spun, and the subject was
broached to a subdued and red-eyed
Stella that very evening.

âOh, Jibby darling! to think of your
really and truly coming to live with us!
Oh, isnât Daddy the very nicest man that
ever lived? He never refused me anything;
not if I had set my heart on it, you
know. And I told him that if you didnât
graduate, then I wouldnât, either; and
the very day I was eighteen I was going
out to Dakota to join you on your own
land, and run that ranch we always
talked about. He only said: âTut, tut,
daughter; weâll do better than that.â

âAnd even motherâs glad, because I do
bother her sometimes when she has a
headache, and now she can play bridge
[156]

all day, if she likes. You and meâll see
to everything, wonât we, Jibby? You
are

coming, arenât you, darling dear?â

Thus Cynthia in one breath, flinging
herself upon her friendâs neck the next
morning, in the prim garden of the old
Spellman homestead, among the old-fashioned
posies, day-lilies and bleeding-heart
and wonderful rose-hued peonies,
while Scotty, with the demonstrative
jealousy of his kind, stood upon his
gaunt hind legs and thrust his cold nose
between the loving pair.

Doris, prettier than ever in all the
dignity of her ankle-long skirts and
âPsyche knotâ of honey-colored hair,
noted Stellaâs hesitating silence and
cannily began, feeling her way:

âYou know, Jibby, Grandma is getting
old and feeble, and she does like you
betterân âmost any one. She wonât let
even me do for her as she will you, Stella
[157]

Waring! I donât see how you manage
to bewitch everybody the way you do.

âUncle Si says, dummed if he wouldnât
like nothing better than for you to come
out there and be his little housekeeper.
Think of that! He never forgot that
breakfast you got for him the day Cynthia
was chased by the bull; and he says that
for nobody else in this endurinâ world
would he have hitched up the critters long
after bed-time of a wet night. I donât
know when heâs been out after eight
oâclock âcept that night he took you
home. Well, arenât you ever going
to speak? We
all
want you, Stella; now
which is it going to be?â

Yellow Star faced her two friends with
almost a tragic gesture of out-flung arms,
and the rare tears in her soft, black eyes.

âDarlings,â she cried, âyou are all
too sweet for anything, and I shall never
forget it as long as I live. To think that
[158]

I have such friends! But do you know,
the most wonderful part of it all is,
Miss
Sophia wants me too
!

âSheâs getting old, you see, and she
isnât used to doing for herself, and she
really does need me, girls. Donât look
like that, Cynthia; sheâs my dear, dear
Mother Waringâs only sisterâthe only
near kin she had in this worldâso she
used to say. Girls, I know I should be
perfectly happy with either of you, but
I canât leave Miss Sophiaâsheâs
folks
.
I know I can take care of her, and here
is where I
belong
.â

And, of course, that settled it.

[159]

CHAPTER XII

HERBS AND SIMPLES

Miss Sophia, notwithstanding
the unexpected turn that affairs
had taken, had by no means
relinquished her point of view. No sooner
was she satisfied that Stella would not
desert her post for any other offer, however
flattering, than she recovered herself
sufficiently to make quite clear to the
girl her changed footing in the Spellman
household.

âOur work is light,â she announced,
coldly, âand I shall expect you to earn
your board. I have no doubt you prefer
to be independent, as far as possible. I
will pay such bills as are necessary, but
there must be no more extras nor nonsense,
mind. As for clothes, youâll
[160]

scarcely outgrow them now, and my
sister kept you so generously supplied
that I should not think you would need
anything new for a long time. A girl in
your position must not expect to dress
as well as a prosperous man like Mr.
Parker or Dr. Brown can afford to dress

his
daughter.â

Yellow Star said nothing, but she was
not slow to take a hint, and she made up
her mind then and there never to ask
Miss Sophia for a dollar or a new dress.
Neither did she want to draw any of her
precious money out of the savings-bank
where Mother Waring had placed it for
her, on their first coming to Laurel.

She was quick and capable; all the
housework for two, except laundry and
heavy cleaning, now fell to her share, and
took up nearly all her time, out of school.
However, there was the long summer
vacation to plan for; and in the spring
[161]

after Mrs. Waringâs death, Stella began
to seek and to find opportunities for
earning small sums of money. She delivered
hats for the local milliner and
gowns for the village dressmaker. She
took a neighborâs baby out in his carriage
on fine days, at ten cents an errand or an
airing. One April afternoon, Doctor
Brown found her on her knees with basket
and trowel, grubbing up dandelions in
Miss Sophiaâs front yard.

âShe pays me a cent apiece, because
she doesnât like to see them in her grass,â
Stella explained, gravely. Miss Sophia
had at least a sense of justice, and
although she exacted full service of the
orphan, to the utmost equivalent of her
modest living, she would not ask her to
do out-of-door work without paying for
it. She had been going to hire a boy for
the dandelions, and Stella had begged for
the chance.

[162]

âWhy, my child, youâll soon be a
CrÅsus at that rate,â laughed the good
Doctor.

âI really need the money for a new
dress,â pursued Stella, who was thoroughly
in earnest. âMiss Frost, the
dressmaker, would like to have me help
her in my spare time; I can make good
buttonholes, and sheâll pay me thirty
cents a dozen. But I would so much
rather do something out-of-doors. You
see, I am indoors nearly all the time, with
my books and the housework, and Iâm

starving
for some fresh air.â

âAhem!â The Doctor cleared his
throat and took the matter under consideration.
He would have dearly liked
to put his big, generous hand in his
pocket and buy the new dress, but he was
half afraid the child wouldnât take itâor,
even if she would, how about that
dawning sense of personal independence?
[163]

No, no! let her earn the dress, especially
since she was wisely choosing the open-air
tasks that should soon restore its
color and roundness to the eager, appealing
young face.

âSensible girl!â he approved. âDo
you know, Stella, those dandelion roots
you are digging have medicinal value?
The wholesale drug-stores will pay you a
few cents a pound for them, when theyâre
properly washed and dried. Thereâs
burdock, too, and tansy, andâlet me
seeâwild mustard and boneset, beside
several more. You must gather the
seed-pods of the mustard, and the leaves
and tops of boneset and tansy. Theyâre
all worth money; and all as common as
dirt hereabouts. The farmers ought to
pay you, too, for helping to get rid of
them; almost every one Iâve named is a
troublesome pest.â

âOh, Doctor Brown! How perfectly
[164]

splendid!â Stella clasped her long,
brown hands eagerly, still kneeling on the
soft turf, and once more the dull glow
crept up in her quiet cheek. âI know
them all now except the tansy, and
youâll show me that, wonât you? And
tell me just where to take them. It will
be exactly what my own mother and her
mother must have done many a timeâdigging
roots and herbs for medicine.
Thereâs nothing else in the whole world
I should like so much.â

âYes, it was I set her up in business,
and a fair sort of business itâs turning
out,â chuckled the Doctor some three
months later, from the depths of his
shabby easy chair. âNot a fortune in it,
of course; but she makes seventy-five
cents or a dollar many days, with Cynthiaâs
help. Why arenât you out with
them, Doris? Afraid of a freckle or two
[165]

my girl? Well, health is beauty, and
their long days in the sun and air, close
to the life-giving earth, will be worth
more than a fortune to them.â

Doris tossed her pretty head, from her
favorite perch in the broad window-seat,
where she was putting careful stitches
in the daintiest of shirt waists.

âThe hot sun and the stooping over
give me a headache,â she complained.
She loved Jibby as much as ever, of
course, but the sacrifice of that apple-blossom
complexion to the Sun-God was
too much to expect.

âWhen I was a girl,â her mother observed,
âI used to be told that it made a
young girl coarse and blowsy to expose
her skin to the wind and sun. Why, I
never thought of going out in summer
without shade-hat, gloves and a veil; and
nowadays the girls wonât wear any one
of them.â

[166]

âI dâ know what the present generationâs
cominâ to,â agreed Grandpa Brown,
discontentedly. âThis new-fangled idee
of livinâ outdoors is suthinâ I donât take
no stock in, fer one. Houses was made to
be lived in, says I; more specially for the
wimmen folks. It used to be thought
ondecent to sleep aout; anâ if folks had
sot a table in the back yard for compâny,
youâd of said theyâd gone plump crazy.
I dunno whether âtwas Stella set the
fashion, or mebbe that school-teacher
from up-state that was always gassinâ
âbout âfresh-air;â but anyhow, Laurelâs
got the disease, anâ got it bad.â

âWhen him anâ me went to house-keepinâ,â
chimed in Grandma, briskly,
âfolks nailed all the winders down hard
anâ fast before âLection day, anâ never
took the nails out till spring cleaninâ.
We didnât hold with warminâ all outdoors,
like they âpear to nowadays.
[167]

Considerinâ them nailed-up winders, anâ
the things we ate anâ drunk, anâ the germs
we hadnât never heard of, Iâve never
rightly onderstood, Ezry, how you âcount
for Grampa anâ me beinâ as peart as we
be, anâ both on us goinâ on for seventy-seven.â

âSpeakinâ of vittles, I ainât never felt
the same sence they took away my pie
for breakfust,â grumbled Grandpa, and
everybody laughed.

Doctor Brown lit his pipe and retired
behind the newspaper, but found himself
thinking less about State politics and the
rise in certain stocks than about the new
idea that his father had unwittingly let
fall. Yes, there was no doubt about it;
it was his little favorite and Miss Morrison,
between them, who had boldly
thrown open the windows and waked up
the sleepy children in stuffy school-rooms,
who had set the fashion of long
[168]

cross-country walks among the younger
set, had revived toboggan parties and
skeeing and âone-day camps,â who had,
in short, conducted an effective âanti-tuberculosis
campaignâ under the disguise
of âfun.â He had not realized
before how much they were all indebted
to that natural hunger for fresh air, so
naÃ¯vely confessed by his âoutdoor girl.â

âThough it
is
bad for my businessâand
the undertakerâs,â he humorously
admitted to himself.

On that same midsummer day, Stella
herself, with loyal Cynthia at her side
and Scotty acting alternately as scout
and rear-guard, was harvesting a field
yellow with feathery wild mustard, down
at âUncle Siâs place.â That eccentric
bachelor had offered to pay handsomely
for the extermination of the weed by
gathering its seed, and this bounty, together
[169]

with the market price of five
cents a pound, had spurred the girls to
unusual exertions.

The work
was
hard, and they had been
at it steadily for two or three hours,
when, with shoulders that ached from
stooping and faces glowing with heat,
they straightened up at last, and looked
longingly over toward the cool shade of
Wolcottâs Woods.

âLetâs get a drink at the spring, and
then sit under that tree awhile and rest,â
begged Cynthia. âIâve got some sandwiches
and a splendid book in my
pocket.â

âWell,â consented Stella, âI suppose
we might. Youâve helped like a Trojan,
Sin, and I âmost know Iâm going to have
money enough for my new fall suit. I
donât want to disgrace our class, you
know,â she added, merrily.

But long before they reached the giant
[170]

maple that cast its green shade over a
far corner of the field, Sir Walter began
to bark wildly, and to make excited little
dashes forward and runs backward, after
his usual idiotic fashion when trouble
was in the wind.

âWhat
do
you suppose is the matter
with him, Jibby?â Sin demanded.

Stella gave a long, searching look ahead
and calmly answered:

âThereâs a man lying down under that
tree.â

âA man! Oh, Jibby! what shall we
do? Hadnât we better run home as fast
as we can?â

âLetâs go a little nearer and see who
it is, first,â suggested the other, suiting
the action to the word.

âItâs a tramp, or somebody dreadful,
I know,â Sin declared, but she would not
desert her friend, and both girls, escorted
by the cringing Sir Walter, drew near to
[171]

the prone figure of a poorly dressed, black-bearded
man, whose hat, stick and bundle
lay at his side.

âHow perfectly horrid he looks!â
Cynthia shuddered under her breath.
âItâs a tramp or a nasty peddler, and heâs
either drunk or asleep. For goodnessâ
sake, Stella, donât go any nearer!â

âHe looks sick to me â¦ and hungry
â¦ and out of work,â her friend pitifully
declared. âPerhaps he hasnât any
place to go. He canât hurt us, and Scotty
would protect us, anyway. (Down, sir!)
Get some water, quick, Cynthia! heâs
had a sunstroke or something,â and
she bent over the âhorrid manâ and
loosened his coarse shirt at the neck,
moistened the livid face with the tin cup
of cold water that Cynthia hastened to
fetch, and fanned him with her broad-brimmed
hat.

When in a few minutes he came to
[172]

himself, he was barely able to speak, and
that in a broken sort of lingo that the
girls could make little of, but dog-like
gratitude looked out of the lusterless
black eyes. Stellaâs strong young arms
helped to raise him to a more comfortable
position, and Cynthia knelt down and
eagerly fed him bits of bread-and-butter
from her lunch-box.

âGo to Uncle Si, please!â directed
Stella. âHe will know what we ought to
do. I shall stay here, with Sir Walter to
take care of me, till you come back.â

But it was while she was still patiently
fanning the stranger and trying to piece
out a meaning from his foreign looks
and words, that Stella was attracted
by fresh activity on the part of the
dog, who had lain apparently asleep at
her feet. She looked up, and saw a tall,
lightly built young man coming rapidly
toward her, his serious face breaking
[173]

into smiles as he noticed her start of
pleased surprise.

âWhy, Ethan! is it really you? Where
did you come from?â she cried, springing
to her feet, but quite forgetting to hold
out her hand. The Sioux are not demonstrative
in the matter of greetings.

Ethan, however, did not hesitate to
take prompt possession of the little brown
hand and press it warmly for a minute,
as he looked into the soft, child-like eyes
which met his with the old simplicity.

âGad, but sheâs a winner! Just about
twice as handsome and ten times as
magnetic as she promised to be, two
years ago,â thought the boy, but he
only said:

âOh, I just ran down for a few days
to see Uncle Si and all the folks! College
opens in three weeks, you knowâmy
last year. Uncle and I were busy talking
over old times and the prospects of the
[174]

crops, and the convivial moment had just
arrived with the buttermilk, when Cynthia
appeared, all out of breath, and from
her story I judged Iâd better come and
look after you without loss of time.

âSo this is your tramp, eh? The poor
chap looks harmless enough, to be sure,
but for all that it was a risky thing
to do, for a girl. I suppose you âwanted
to helpâ like that time I had to
fetch you home at ten oâclock at night
from Buffalo Billâs Wild Westâdo you
remember?â

The girlâs rich color deepened a trifle
under his openly admiring eyes, as he
added, pleasantly:

âHeâs better now, thanks to the little
Samaritan; a green Polander out of a
job, I should say at a guess. Suppose I
toll him over to Uncle Siâs place and try
to persuade the old fellow that he wants
an extra hand?

[175]

âBut if you often get into such
scrapes, I donât see how you could keep
it up very long without me to help you
out, Stella.â

[176]

CHAPTER XIII

INDIAN HOSPITALITY

Among the hoarded possessions of
gentle âMother Waringâ which
fell to her little girl, was a large
and varied collection of Indian photographs.
Stella had often turned them
over and over, with almost painful interest;
she did so once again; and after
choosing with great care a single one,
laid all the rest away.

The picture that now stood conspicuously
on her old-fashioned bureau was
a large one taken in Washington many
years earlier. It showed a group of three
strong faces belonging to leading men of
the Sioux in the middle of the nineteenth
centuryâthe last, indeed, of their tribal
leaders, trained in native ways.

[177]

âI donât think thatâs a very pretty
picture,â remarked Cynthia, carelessly,
one day when the three friends had
gathered in Stellaâs little chamber up
under the eaves. âWhy didnât you pick
out that one in the beaded shirt and
eagle-feather war-bonnet down to his
heels?â

âI liked the cunning little baby in its
motherâs arms,â Doris suggested.

âOr that perfectly splendid young
Indian man whoâs in college somewhere,
going to be a minister,â persisted Sin.
âSeems to me these old Indians in long
hair and plain clothes are rather a hard-looking
crowd,â she added.

It was often difficult for Stella to explain
herself. She was silent now, but her
cheeks took on the dark flush they wore
when she was deeply moved. Cynthia
saw it, and hastened to add:

âAfter all, though, thereâs something
[178]

pretty
fine
about them. That one in the
middle, now; isnât he sort of solid and
hard and grand, like a big, gray boulderâorâor
a charging buffalo?â

âI like to look at them every day,â
murmured Stella, at last, with a grateful
glance. Cynthia always understood; perhaps
not just at first, but in time she was
sure to understand. âYou see, girls,
those were real
men
; strong and just,
faithful and truth-speaking. They were
men who talked little and did much. We
younger Indians who float along like
chips on the current need to keep before
our eyes the old strength of our race.
Those faces seem to me carved, as you
say, just like out of solid rock.â

A day or two later, a little knot of
academy girls were all trying to talk at
once, in excited voices of which only
snatches could be heard.

[179]

âI shouldnât think sheâd want to push
herself in where she isnât wantedâ¦â

âNobodyâll speak to her if she does
come.â

âJust as if our crowd cared to associate
with shop-girls andââ

Apparently it was all an affair of the
social club with the mysterious initials,
which had held regular meetings since
their sophomore year. It was a club that
took pleasure in being exclusive, and had
little regard for the point of view of the
excluded. How foolish it was of them to
feel sore or resentful! Rosey Bernstein,
undoubtedly a star pupil, was vulgarly
witty at the expense of the club and its
unimportant secrets and foolish little
mysteries.

There had never been any question
about Stellaâs membershipâStella whom
she and two or three others had been
inclined to persecute in the early days,
[180]

but had given it up when they found to
their surprise that the word âIndianâ
was held a title of honor, rather than a
term of reproach. In scholarship they
were neck and neck; but what won
Rosey completely was the Indian girlâs
unaffected admiration of the fat Bernstein
baby, of whom the whole family was
inordinately proud. Babies were Stellaâs
weak point, anyway.

But we are losing sight of our conversation,
which concerned, not Rosey or
Mary Maloney, but a little girl who had
been obliged to drop out of her class in
their Senior year, and go to work in the
factory to help support a large family.

Poor Milly was so slight, so shy, so
unpretending, that it did seem as if she
might have been allowed to slip in without
remark among her more fortunate
classmates, on the Saturday half-holiday.
It was soon settled, however, that she was
[181]

ânot their kind at all,â that it had been
all a mistake having her in the first place,
and she must be made to feel that now
she had left school she ought
of course
to
resign from the Club. There being no
dissent from this proposition, the girls
were about to take up the programme for
their next meeting, when a clear young
voice with the least bit of foreign accent
suddenly broke in upon the talk.

âGirls, Iâve been reading in an old
book how the New England Indians made
the first white men welcome and gave
them the best they had, and how the
poor exiles here and in Virginia would
have starved many times if it hadnât
been for the Indiansâ corn. I wondered,
just at first, why they did it, because the
strangers were so different, and you
know we donât usually like people who are
a different color or race or even dress or
live differently. And then I remembered
[182]

that we Indians are always taught to be
kind to strangersâto feed even our
enemies if they come to us hungry or in
troubleâwhat you call
hospitality
. The
Christian white people donât teach their
children hospitality, do they?â

There was a minuteâs surprised silence.

âAfter all, girls, it wonât hurt us a bit
to let Milly come whenever she can;
probâly it wonât be very often,â hesitated
Doris.

âHave any of you seen her lately?â
Cynthia broke in. âShe was always
little, you know, but now! Why, thereâs
nothing to her at all. She looks just as
neat and nice as ever, but oh my! Just
as if she didnât get enough to eat. Her
father doesnât work regularly, you know;
and her mother was in the hospital six
months; Milly earns three dollars a week
and has to work from seven in the morning
until six at night, except Saturday afternoons
[183]

and Sundays. I asked her why
she hadnât been to Sunday-school lately,
and she said she spent all day Sunday
washing and ironing her clothes, because
she was so tired she simply couldnât do
it evenings; but I think it was partly
because she dreaded meeting the girls
she used to go with.â

Here Doris began to cry quietly, and
the other girls, who were really good-hearted
enough at bottom, looked so
ashamed of themselves that Stella slipped
away as soon as she could.

âThereâs one thing more I must speak
about, girls,â she said, as soon as the
three inseparables were out of hearing.
âYou know I havenât taken my turn at
entertaining the Clubâand this is our
third yearâand each of you has had
them at your house two or three times.
Iâve been thinking and thinking.â

âOh, donât, Jibby darling!â cried
[184]

Doris, distressed. âNobody
expects
you
to entertain; we all understand.â

âEverybody in Laurel knows
Miss
Sophia
,â declared Cynthia, with bitter
emphasis.

âI canât help it; I
must
do something
for the others, just once! No, I canât
ask Miss Sophia to have them at her
house, even if I buy all the refreshments
with my own money. She is very
particular about her floorsâand the
dishesâa cup might get broken or
something. But oh, Doris!
do
you suppose
Uncle Siâ?â

âWhy, of course! why didnât we think
of it before? A picnic in Wolcottâs Woods;
why, it would be just
scrumptious
!â interrupted
Doris, while irrepressible Sin
seized an arm of each and whirled them
round and round till all were laughing
and out of breath.

âHow about a week from Saturday?â
[185]

âItâs nearly always fine, this time of
year.â âHow will you get us all out
there?â âWhat shall you have to eat,
Jibby?â Poor Stella was fairly buried
under the rush of eager questions and
exclamations.

When the great day came at last, a
perfect afternoon in late September, Uncle
Siâs springless farm wagon, cushioned
with golden oat straw and drawn by a
pair of sleek, black horses, rumbled merrily
from door to door through the village,
taking in some fifteen happy passengers.
The first surprise came when it was
found that not only shrinking little Milly,
but every girl in the class was of the
party. It had been Stellaâs shy request
to have the âundesirablesâ as her personal
guests for the day, and that innocent
little remark about âChristian white
peopleâ had somehow made it uncomfortable
[186]

to refuse. The âB. N.âsâ had
yet to discover how much more satisfaction
there is in getting people in than
in merely keeping them out.

The democratic âstraw ride,â a revival
of an all but forgotten fashion, took
exceedingly well, and it was a well-shaken-together
crowd that tumbled out
at Uncleâs âspring house,â where delicious,
ice-cold buttermilk, sweet milk,
or pure spring water was served to
everybody. Of course, the girlsâ throats
were dry from much singing and shouting,
so that nothing could have been better.

The next stop was at the big hay-barn,
where all were invited to hunt for eggs in
the clean, sweet-smelling mows. This
was great fun; and when the eggs proved
to be hard-boiled, the plan of this progressive
picnic began to declare itself.

At the kitchen door, which stood invitingly
open, stood a beaming neighbor
[187]

woman with a bucket of steaming coffee
and a basket of fried chickens, done to a
turn, and these were quickly conveyed to
the near-by apple orchard, where a few
boards and sawhorses had been converted
into a rustic table, fancifully decorated
with ferns and autumn leaves in Cynthiaâs
original style.

But the nicest surprise of all was a
blazing bonfire at a convenient distance,
withâyes, it was actually Ethan,
attired as an Indian brave and lavishly
feathered, bending dutifully over it,
flanked by a mammoth heap of late
roasting ears.

After the substantials had been consumed,
somebody offered a prize for the
biggest apple, which was easily won by
Cynthia, the best climber and biggest
tom-boy in the crowd. Meanwhile, a
huge, frosted cake had appeared upon the
table, Dorisâ motherâs contribution to
[188]

the feast, and Ethan slyly suggested that
treasure was sometimes found in woodpeckersâ
nests, which led to another
joyous scramble, and the discovery of
handfuls of pop-corn balls and Shaker
sweetmeats in tempting hollows of the
old apple-trees.

By-and-by the whole company gathered
in a circle around the dying bonfire,
and Cynthia, with apparent unpremeditation,
proposed an hour of story-telling.

Doris set the ball rolling with the very
old tale of the Ash and the Elm, the
father and mother of mankind, as told
by the Abenakis, the Indians of New
England. Both trees grew in Uncleâs
door-yard; and her hearers, looking up,
seemed to realize for the first time the
graceful femininity of the drooping elm,
and the sturdiness of the more robust and
straight-limbed ash-tree.

âThere was once a chief who had three
[189]

daughters,â began Rosey, promptly,
âand the youngest daughter was much
the prettiest, so that all the young men
wanted to marry her. After all, she married
the Turtle, who was very lazy, and
lounged about the camp-fire while the
others fished and hunted. They all hated
him because he had won the handsomest
girl in the village, and yet did nothing to
keep her. One day, they caught him out
of sight of home, and at once told him
that they had decided to build a big fire,
and roast him alive.

ââAh, that is what I like!â boasted
the Turtle. âYou canât get it too warm to
suit me.â

âThen some one suggested that they
had better drown him instead, and the
Turtle appeared to be much worried.
He cried and begged for mercy, but they
seized hold of him in spite of his struggles,
and threw him into the lake near by.

[190]

ââHa, ha! now I am at home!â exclaimed
the Turtle, and he dived down
into the cool water and left them all
gaping and angrier than ever.â

After everybody had laughed at the
expense of the disappointed suitors, Cynthia
began the story of Lox, the mischief-maker,
who one day uprooted a wild
plum-tree and set it on his head, so that
he scattered ripe fruit as he walked.

âPretty soon,â related Sin, âhe met
two fun-loving girls, who begged that
they too might be allowed to wear such
charming and surprising head-dresses.

âSo Lox planted on each of their heads
a small plum-tree, by his magic power
fastening the roots firmly in their long
black hair. The girls went home very
proud and pleased, and soon found themselves
the talk of the village.

âAfter a while they grew tired of being
pointed at, as well as of carrying the
[191]

plum-trees on their heads, and each tried
to pull the otherâs tree out by the roots.
They pulled and pulled with all their
might, and at last they got them out;
but, because all their beautiful hair was
pulled out too, the girls cried bitterly, and
wished they had not been so foolish.â

So it went all round the ring; and
when it came the turn of their hostess,
she could scarcely speak for surprise and
pleasure in the pretty compliment to her
well-loved people. After she had capped
the climax with one of her best Dakota
tales,
[1]
they were all delighted to hear
the sound of a rustic, rollicking dance-tune
played on the old fiddle by Uncle
Si himself, who had certainly entered into
the spirit of the occasion with all the
zest of a boy.

Uncle was sitting out on the side porch
[192]

in his shirt-sleeves, and there was a
nice, level stretch of turf inviting to the
dance. Tune followed tune until everybody
was out of breath, and the frolic
ended with a weird, make-believe âGhost
Dance,â and a most realistic scalp-dance,
in which the girls held at armsâ length
one anotherâs fallen tresses, while going
through steps and figures that would
certainly have put an Indian brave to the
blush.

The sun was getting low when the
straw-lined Cinderellaâs coach, driven by
Ethan this time, drew up at the farmhouse
porch for its happy freight of tired
girls. It really did seem as if the class
of 19ââ had never known each other so
well before, never felt so close to the soil
and so pleasantly alive to the spirits of
the past, as after they had shared the
hospitality of the Indian girl and her big-hearted
Uncle Si.

[193]

CHAPTER XIV

AN END AND A BEGINNING

The three âClover Leavesâ will
never, never forget their last year
at the little old academy. The
square, white tower with its peremptory,
sweet-toned bell that dominated their
waking hours and all but ruled their
dreams; the arm-in-arm saunter from
school through autumnâs mellow haze,
or gay exchange of greetings on the crisp
winter air; the stiff portions of Latin
and French and mathematics sweetened
with girlish mirth and nonsense; the
Senior dance and the Senior play and all
the new-made dignities of that momentous
yearâthese still haunt the charmed
halls of memory, among the sweetest
ghosts of lifeâs phantom past.

[194]

And with it all, with all the modest
ambitions and the innocent vanities,
there was mingled many a longing or an
anxious thought of âwhat nextââof
the real problems that lay beyond that
mysterious closed door.

For most of the boys the next thing was
workâjust plain, every-day work on
the farm or in the shop; for a few, both
boys and girls, it was college or normal,
and then school-teaching or another profession.
Doris and her mother had no
thought but of the dear home duties
and the small social triumphs that beckoned
so plainly, when the pretty, only
daughter should have âfinished her education.â
But Cynthia and Stella were
of a different mold, and they passed
many a happy hour in sharing their
confidences and their dreams, which
ranged all the way from that ranch in
Dakota on Stellaâs allotment, which they
[195]

were to run together, riding their own
range triumphantly in the approved cow-girl
fashion, to the glorious vision of
Stella as a famous doctor and Cynthia
as a great artist.

The modest business in herbs and
simples had led its votary to pursue her
botany a little further, and make a
special study of medicinal plants. She
was often discovered hidden away in a
corner of Doctor Brownâs office, eagerly
comparing âGrayâ with the âMateria
Medica;â and she found, too, that
Grandma Brown was more than ready
to impart the neglected virtues of mullein
and catnip, dock and sassafras, some of
which Stella tested by personal experiment,
while the girls began teasingly
to call her the âYarb-Doctor.â

Doctor Brown secretly believed nothing
beyond the capacity of his favorite,
but he conscientiously meant not to
[196]

encourage ambitions that it might be
impossible to realize.

âThose hands of Stellaâs,â he impulsively
remarked one day, when her
future was under discussion, letting his
sage eyes rest meditatively upon the
long, supple, sensitive membersââwell,
they do say such hands can only belong
to a doctor or a musician.â

âOr a mother,â unexpectedly murmured
his wife.

He gave her a quick, approving look,
and again the warm blood glowed in the
Indian girlâs dark cheek. She suddenly
remembered how Ethan had been telling
her of his plans to study medicine the
next year, and how she had listened
with all her heart in her face, and at
last cried out without thinking:

âOh, I wish,
how
I wish I could be
a doctor, too!â

She remembered vividly the peculiar
[197]

look in his eyes as he gently answered:

âI could wish it tooâunlessâunless
you were meant for something even
better, Stella.â

And she had not understood at all.

Before the March sun began to melt
the snow-drifts, Stellaâs friends got together
privately and laid their plans to
present her with her Commencement
Day outfit. She had worn all winter the
trim suit and modest hat purchased with
her summerâs work in the fields, after
the rows of drying shelves in Miss
Sophiaâs garret had been cleared of their
aromatic burden. And oddly charming
she looked in themâlike a symphony
in browns, with her gleaming agate skin
and the intense black of hair and eyes for
contrast. But the âweed moneyâ was
all gone, and there was no time for extra
[198]

earning that last, busy year. Surely she
could not be so wickedly proud as to
reject an offering of true love.

Mr. Parker insisted upon purchasing
the dressâa duplicate of Cynthiaâs.
It was fine handkerchief linen, and Mrs.
Brown, who made all Dorisâ clothes,
would make it up simply and beautifully,
while Doris devoted all her spare minutes
for weeks to certain individual touches
of hand embroidery. Cynthia recklessly
squandered a whole monthâs pocket-money
on the long, white suede gloves,
and Grandma Brown unearthed from
among her girlhoodâs treasures a sandal-wood
fan of delicious memory.

Doctor Brown brought home one day
a small watch cased in gun-metal with
Stellaâs name on it, and Miss Morrison,
who had gone back to the city to teach,
sent a long, curiously wrought gun-metal
chain.

[199]

But the most surprising contributions
came from Uncle Si Wolcott and Miss
Sophia. Uncle Si actually âhitched upâ
and drove to Westwood for the finest
pair of bronze slippers and bronze silk
stockings to be bought with money.
Miss Sophia had tatted a handkerchief,
but being impressed at the last minute
with the apparent meanness of her
offering as compared with the others,
she unlocked a certain bureau drawer
and took from it a quaint comb of
carved ivory, fetched home from China
by a seafaring ancestor, which gave the
crowning touch to Stellaâs strange beauty,
set in the swirling masses of her blue-black
hair.

The girl laughed and cried when she
saw them, forgetting for once all her
Indian stoicism, and stroked the lovely
frock with reverent fingers, saying
softly:

[200]

âDo you know, dears, I can
love

these clothes!â

There was one more gift, that came by
mail on the very day of fate itself. It
was a box just long enough to hold the
diploma, the sandal-wood fan, the ivory
comb, and any treasures worthy a place
with these. It was cunningly made by
hand out of fragrant, warm-hearted
cedar-wood, fitted with a tiny lock and
key, and decorated with a knife in conventionalized
designs, chief of which was
the recurring device of a five-pointed
star. Doris and Cynthia were the only
ones privileged to admire Ethanâs gift.

Next to the bride in the affections of
rural New England stands the fair girl
graduate, and that June day in Laurel
was apparently quite given over to the
triumphant parade of simple-hearted
youth. In many a modest home, solicitous
[201]

mothers were robing and adorning
their daughters as if for the altar itself,
and that evening in the town hall it
seemed as if every soul in the village, old
and young, rich and poor, must be pressing
into a seat or peering curiously in at
open door or window.

And now the orchestra struck up and
the platform began to fillâthat platform
fluttering with banners and banked with
the dark-green, glossy leaves and rosy
chalices of the mountain laurel that
gave the village its name. Pete Holley,
a strapping youth of color, and star of
the football team, took his place with
dignity. Mary Maloney, the washer-womanâs
daughter, more elaborately
dressed than most, sat happily in the
front row next to demure Doris, whose
piano solo made a pleasing variation in
the programme.

Stella, too, had a âpartââshe and
[202]

Rosey Bernstein led their class; and those
who saw her on that day of days will
long remember the tall, swaying figure,
the gliding step, the vivid, dark face with
its touch of foreign distinction among the
rosy village girls, and most of all the
tender, rhythmic tones that rang so true
in her touching farewell to school days
and to the comrades of that golden time.

For Yellow Star had made her difficult
decisionâto go back to her own people
and do for them what she could. There
had come, in the early spring, a cry for
helpâanother dingy scrawl in scarce
legible Dakota from the Indian camp on
Cherry Creek. Blue Earth had a âbad
heart;â her husband, Young Eagle, had
left her and gone across the Big Water
with the show; she had a baby girl now,
and the boy was five years old. She
wanted them to âwalk the white manâs
road,â and she wanted The-One-who-was-left-Alive
[203]

to come and live with her, and
teach her how to teach her children.
There were many women in the camp, she
said, who needed such help.

After a sleepless night with the letter
under her pillow, the girl had shown it to
her friends and asked their advice. In
her heart, she knew that there was only
one answer possible, and they read her
decision in her face. Of course, Doris and
Cynthia cried a little, and squeezed her
hands, and begged her ânot to give up her
plans, darling;â while Miss Sophia held
her peace with remarkable consistency
and success. But Doctor Brown promptly
hunted up Mr. Parker, and the two had
an important conference.

âI can see she means to go, and it may
be the best thing to do, for a time, at any
rate,â the Doctor admitted, gruffly. âBut
thereâs just one thing about it; that girl
is not going into an Indian camp without
[204]

position or backing. Sheâs too handsome,
for one thing; and too young and trusting
altogether. Young as she is, Stella
is competent to fill a good place in the
Government Indian Service, and that
she must have!â

âIâve been telling my wife Iâd like
nothing better than to send the girl
through college, if she wants to go,â
demurred Mr. Parker. âI think she
could persuade my girl to go with herâthere
or anywhere! Say, Doc! are you
dead sure she ought to butt in amongst
a lot of half-savage Siouxâa girl who
would make a place for herself in any
community?â

âI donât know much about the American
Indian, but judging from our Stella,
there must be good stuff in the breed,â
answered the Doctor, stanchly. âSheâd
make a magnificent nurseâdoctor, perhaps;
but sheâs too young to begin
[205]

training yet awhile. Better let her try
it out west for a year or two; she will,
anyway; sheâs made up her mind, and
you know what that means. What I
came over to ask you is have you any
wires to pull thatâll land our little girl in
the Indian Service? What?â

âSure,â assented Mr. Parker, heartily.
âThereâs Senator Morton; heâll do anything
for meâwithin reason, of course.
Weâll fix it up in no time.â

When Stella herself was cautiously consulted,
a fortnight later, she declared that
she did not know enough to teach and
would rather not take a school position.
She wanted to live right in the camp, she
said, close to the people; to help the poor,
ignorant women and children, like Blue
Earth and her babies.

âThen you want to be a field matron,â
pronounced the Doctor, who had been
studying the subject. âSix hundred a
[206]

year and the right to draw on the agency
for suppliesâsoap and buckets and
rations for sick people and all that.
The work just what you would be doing
anyway, and the whole United States
Government back of you. Thatâs the
talk.â

And so it came about that our eighteen-year-old
Indian girl delivered her valedictory
with her appointment as field matron
at Cherry Creek pinned inside her white
frock, right over the loving heart that
beat high with the hope of service.

[207]

CHAPTER XV

THE SCENE SHIFTS

Cherry Creek is one of those
erratic streams that flow eastward
into the brown Missouri across the
billowing plainsânow a mere wavy line
of timber fringing a dry ravine; again an
angry yellow flood that drowns box-elder
and wild cherry and washes the feet
of the slim young cottonwoods.

The sun-brimmed solitude of a September
day enfolded the two girls, Blue
Earth and Yellow Starâfor, although
mother of a five-year-old boy, the deserted
wife of Young Eagle was in reality
not so much older than her friendâas
they happily gathered red-and-yellow
Dakota plums in the rustling thickets
away up the creek. The young mother
[208]

was quaintly robed in a loose, wide-sleeved
âDakota gownâ of Turkey red
calico, while the young maid was more
trimly clad in one of the plain, indigo-blue
prints that she had last worn in Mrs.
Sophiaâs kitchen. Only the freedom of
the new life was symbolized and expressed
by sleeves rolled over the dimpled, brown
elbows, uncovered, glossy head, and soft,
richly embroidered moccasins on the
slender feet.

The honey-sweet plums, a peck or
more, had been harvested in a wide-mouthed
cotton sack. âLet me carry itâyou
have the baby!â cried Yellow
Star, gayly tossing the sack over one
shoulder, while the other picked up a
placid bundle rolled in a patchwork quilt
from under the wild plum tree, and with
much maternal cooing and chattering
proceeded to secure it on her back, in the
folds of the bright shawl she wore.

[209]

âChas-kay! Chas-ka-a-ay! Where is
the little rascal?â she scolded, good-humoredly;
and Yellow Star took up the
musical call and sent it ringing through
the ravines. In a minute or so, there
came obediently stumbling up the slippery
bank a queer little nondescript
figure, attired in nothing but a green
calico shirt and a pair of tiny moccasins,
its two tight braids of black hair tied up
with red flannel, and the round face of a
shining cinnamon brown set with two
black gems, in the shape of a pair of
sparkling, mischievous eyes.

âI was only digging medicine,â the elf
soberly announced; âgood medicine for
The-One-who-was-left-Alive!â He held
up a long, straggling root, and looked so
irresistibly important that both girls burst
into peals of tuneful laughter.

âI was only digging medicine,â the elf soberly announced.

Page 209.

âWeâll take it to show Grandmother,â
declared the one so favored, whose
[210]

botanical studies had already suggested
to her to penetrate, if possible,
the mysteries of the Dakota herbalist.
She seized his little, earth-stained hand
and all three set out for the campâa
huddle of log cabins, looking for
all the world like the âcob housesâ
of children, interspersed with an occasional
brush arbor or rude corral, and
with many of the white, conical teepees
of the Sioux.

Glimpsed in the distance, under a sky
quivering with heat and against a wide
background of sunburnt grass, the whole
looked more like a toy village than anything
real and serious, at all events to the
new-comer, who, with all her earnestness
of purpose, had fallen to some degree
under the spell of that colorful, elemental
existence.

The zest of the open spaces and the
free winds, the absence of clocks and bells
[211]

and whistles and other insistent reminders
and regulators of our time-slavery,
the fascinating simplicity and
friendliness of the dark-faced, smiling
peopleâ
her
peopleâin their easy, picturesque
garb, all these had seemed so
restful, so almost intoxicating, after
the set tasks of many well-ordered
years.

When they reached camp and threw
down their burdens under the shade of a
large arbor of boughs, where an old
woman with gray witch-locks flying loose
and a skin like dark-brown parchment
looked up from her eternal moccasin-mending,
and a long-haired dog not much
bigger than a rat flew to greet them with
all but articulate cries of joyâthen, indeed,
they were at home!

âSh-h-h-Sheka!â Blue Earth was
tired and hungry, and drove off the dog
with a rush of angry sibilants.

[212]

âHere, Sheka, Sheka! Poor little
thing,â coaxed Yellow Star, pitifully.

âHow many did you get?â demanded
Grandmother, reaching greedily for the
sack. âThe Blue-Coat has been here
with a paper; I think it is from the Little
Father. I gave him coffee and bread,
and he told me all the news. Here is
the paper,â and she drew it from her
wide sleeve and held it toward the
girl.

Yellow Star took the agentâs letter
and glanced it over as she stood, while the
others, Chaskay and Sheka included,
gazed steadily into her thoughtful face
with frank curiosity.

âIt is only to say that the sewing-machines
will not be here until next
month. I shaânât wait for them; the
women are coming to-morrow, and thereâs
plenty of hand sewing for the present,â
and she entered the little house with
[213]

quite a different air from that of the plum
thicket.

Certainly the Indian agent, at his first
interview some weeks earlier, had not to
complain of any lack of dignity in the
young field matron.

âYou understand that suitable quarters
will be provided for you, Missâah!âMiss
Waring,â he had drawled, keeping
his heavy-lidded eyes upon her face
with a persistency that was not altogether
pleasant.

(âFirst Indian girl I ever Missâd,â he
acknowledged later to his grinning cronies
in the office, âand it came sort of hard.
Nothing else for it, though. Sheâs considerable
of a lady,
she
is!â

âConsiderable to look at, too, I shâd
say,â Jack Pepper mumbled under his
breath.)

âI expect to stay with my friend,
Young Eagleâs wife, in her house on
[214]

Cherry Creek,â Stella had replied, simply.
âHer grandmother will live with us.â

âHum-ha â¦ Missâah!âWaring,
if you have quite made up your mind to
that, we shall have to make some improvements
on the house. Itâs an ordinary
log cabin, isnât it, Mr. Pepper? â¦ one
room? â¦ Two? Thatâs good. Well,
Iâll tell you what weâll do. We will build
a frame addition 16 by 20 feet, for the field
matronâs private apartment, with three
windows and a good floor; lay floors in
the other two rooms and put on a good,
shingled roof. With these additions, I
think you ought to be fairly comfortable.â

âThank you, Major; that will be quite
satisfactory,â Stella had answered, calmly.

âAnd about the furnitureâ (still keeping
a furtive eye upon her face)ââMr.
Pepper, will you take thisâah!âthis
[215]

young lady to the warehouse and help
her make out a list of her needs in that
line? We supply only the necessaries, of
course: iron beds with mattress and
blankets, tables, kitchen chairs, stoves,
dishes and so forth. If there is anything
more that I can do for you, Miss Waring,
I shall be happy to see you at any time.â

Possibly the âLittle Fatherâ would
not have been quite so bland and accommodating
if he had not had in his desk
at that moment a letter from Washington,
containing very plain instructions as
to the conveniences to be supplied and
the official courtesies to be extended to
the newly appointed field matron, Miss
Stella Waring. The good Doctorâs precautions
were already justified.

The first meeting of the Cherry Creek
sewing circle was a decided successâthat
is to say, the first ever held there
[216]

under the civilizing auspices of a paternal
Government, since from time immemorial
the Sioux women have been accustomed
to get together in the fashion common to
all other women under the sun. For
nobody knows how many hundreds of
years they have plied their feminine
implementsâsuch as awl of bone and
sinew of deerâand with dyed quills of
the porcupine and hand-wrought of
trader-bought beads, with skins tanned
to a velvety softness or costly broadcloth
of red and blue, have made and decorated
their native finery with no mean skill, the
while their tongues were busy with soft
syllables of domestic chat and village
gossip, after the universal feminine pattern.

The time was now ripe, it seemed, for
some advance along these time-honored
lines. Indeed, this small settlement on
Cherry Creek is still among the most
[217]

primitive on the whole Sioux reservation,
having no day-school or settled mission
of its own, and several of the women had
expressed a wish to learn of their sophisticated
sister the complicated art of the
white womanâs dress-making.

So here they were, gathered under the
picturesque brush arbor to the number of
a score or more, the younger attired as
gayly as tropical birds, the elder in sober
plumage of dingy browns and grays, all
with demurely drooping plaits of hair
and shoulders modestly draped in the
invariable shawl. Most were primly
seated on common wooden chairs, while
a few of the older and more conservative
preferred a blanket on the hard-trodden
earth floor.

Stella had a table full of work cut out
and basted; puritanical checked gingham
dresses and wide print aprons, together
with boxes of thimbles and needles and
[218]

thread; and the lesson proceeded, at first
with some constraint, but soon with a
loosening of tongues and a torrent of soft
laughter and musical dialect.

Of course, all who had babies had
brought them on their patient backs, and
several youngsters of Chaskayâs age or
younger were tumbling about the floor
or running races over the sunshiny prairie.
There were almost as many dogs as
children, and a certain Miss Day, who
had neither, appeared with the pretty,
striped face of her pet âcoon peeping
coquettishly over one shoulder.

Presently refreshments were served
in orderly fashion by the two young
hostessesâtea, boiled rice flavored with
meat, the plums gathered the day before,
and a quantity of small, flaky, biscuit
baked that morning by Yellow Star.

âI should like to make biscuit like
those,â Miss Day remarked, after an
[219]

astonishing number had been consumed.

âCan you teach me to make the spongy
bread of the white people?â asked another.

âMy husband has often asked for the
apple-pie he had at school,â chimed in a
little bride.

âWe will have a cooking-class,â
laughed the young field matron, âand
learn to make all these and many more.
You must all keep chickens and milk a
cow or two; then we can have ever so
many good thingsâthings fit to build
strong bodies for your children.â

âIf only the Little Father would not
take them all away from us, as soon as
they can walk, almost, to fill his school!â
mourned an older woman.

âDid you know that the Little Father
had given his permission for a dance to-night?â
whispered a flighty girl to Blue
[220]

Earth, whose face lighted up quickly at
the news. Then she glanced half guiltily
at her friend, justly fearing that the
Indian dance might be under a ban. The
comfortable house and abundance of food,
to say nothing of sympathetic companionship,
were too good to risk lightly.

âBut you went to the white peopleâs
dances when you were in the East,â she
pleaded, after the others had gone, and
the slow, teasing throbs of the dance-drum
resounded through the village.

âThatâs quite different,â Yellow Star
explained. âWe want our people to forget
these exciting customs, and care for
better things,â she reasoned, gently.

âBut Iâm not going to dance; I only
want to look on a little while,â begged
Blue Earth, as humbly as a child.

âAll the white people do that; even
the Little Father himself,â pronounced
Grandmother.

[221]

âThen, will you promise to come home
as soon as it is dark?â

âOh, yes!â cried the other, eagerly.

But, like another Cinderella, she forgot,
and lingered near an open window of
the large, circular dance-house, her baby
asleep on her back, gazing fascinated
on the gorgeous, barbaric spectacle of
painted, half-clad men executing their
wonderful steps and poses, till aroused by
a touch on her arm and a sweet, reproachful
voice in her ear. And this is the true
story of how the field matron chanced to
be observed by old Standing Cloud and
others, in the outer circle of the Grass
Dance after dark of a balmy September
evening, a fact which came duly to Jack
Pepperâs ears and made her some little
trouble, later on.

[222]

CHAPTER XVI

BY RETURN OF POST

Laurel, April thirtieth
.

Stella darling
: If you only
knew how we miss you here in
Laurel! It seems like years since
you went away; can it be itâs only nine
months? And you donât write half as
often as you promised. I wonder what
you are really and truly up to!

âHave you picked out your allotment
yet? Be sure and get a good one. Oh,
how I wish I were twenty-one this
minute! Daddy perfectly understands
that the very day I come of age I shall
start on the long journey to Dakota, to
join my dear friend Stella and stock that
cattle ranch.

âOf course, you will want to hear all
[223]

the news. Doris has been spending two
weeks in Boston with her uncleâthe
rich one. What do you think? she went
to the Symphony Orchestra twice, and to
the opera once, and to twoâno, three
dances! She has the loveliest braided
suit in a perfectly exquisite shade of
blue; and a set of chinchilla furs for
Christmas; and two new party dresses
and a pale-blue evening cape lined with
salmon that is simply a dream. I
canât tell you half. Doris is getting to be
a
regular society girl
; and that, you know,
Jibby, I never wanted to be and never
will.

âMother bought me a handsome suit,
tooâmine is the new copper shadeâand
a stylish hat; and Daddy would have
taken me to New York on his last trip,
but just then poor old Scotty had to
break his leg, and of course I wouldnât
stir for
worlds
.

[224]

âOh, I must tell you all about it!
Just fancy! Ethan Honey happened to be
in town over Easter, stopping with Uncle
Si; and you know there isnât any vet in
Laurel; and so, I just âphoned himâI
was almost crazy, of courseâand asked
what
should
I do! He was perfectly
splendid; got to the house in less than
half an hour, and set the leg so that itâs
practically as good as new! Wasnât it
clever of the dear boy? They say heâs
thought everything of at the medical
school, and bound to make a name for
himself, some day.

âSpeaking of Uncle Si, he hasnât been
quite as well as usual this winter; âkinder
off the hooks,â as he says. Mother
Brown is trying to persuade him that he
oughtnât to live out there all alone any
longer. Uncle Si says âitâs all-fired
lonesome since the gals stopped cominââ
and if you âhad a hankerinâ after missionary
[225]

work, he could âaâ showed you
where you could put in your best licks,
right here at hum.â He means looking
after him, of course; did you ever hear of
anything so selfish? But old people are
always selfish, I think.

âGrandma Brown says that a girl
thatâd disappint her own pa and hurt his
feelinâs for the sake of a outlandish hound
dog hadnât ought to have a pa. You
know she never liked me so very well,
anyway. Sheâs always telling Doris how
much better you used to do things. Doris
says, if she didnât love you dearly, sheâd
have been sick to death of hearing your
name, long before this.

âYou asked me in two or three of your
letters about Miss Sophia. I donât see
why you care so much about Miss Sophia;

she
never did anything for
you
if she could
possibly help it. She never liked me,
either; I went to see her, entirely for
[226]

your sake, dear, about a week ago. Seems
to me sheâs getting kind of old and feeble;
and one funny thing, she didnât scold a
bit, not even when Scotty would squeeze
past me and put his paw right up on her
black cashmere lap. I donât see how he
ever dared. She asked me twice, when I
heard from you last.

âMiss Morrison was in town the other
day. She inquired after you the very
first thing, of course. Miss Morrison
thinks it was very fine and noble in you
to go out to Cherry Creek.

âWhy do you never say a word about
the boys? Arenât there any nice ones at
all? Of course, you know how it is here;
theyâre
all
devoted to Doris! The next
thing weâll hear will be that sheâs
engaged
!
Jibby, darling, Iâm just as sure as ever
that I shall never,
never
want to get married.
You
will
wait for me, wonât you?
Wait till Iâm twenty-one, I mean, and
[227]

we can live together all the rest of our
lives.

âYour own

â
Cynthia
.

â
Cherry Creek, May the eighth
.

â
My dearest Cynthia
: About half
an hour ago, a girl you used to know was
looking out of the window of her little
prairie home. Such a funny little home,
just one big room all shining yellow pine,
[228]

with skins and rag rugs on the bare pine
floor, a closet curtained off with dark blue
calico, a black iron bed and a wash-stand
and a trunk and some book-shelves
built out of packing-boxes. Oh, and a lot
of Indian bead-work on the walls, and a
pine table covered with a Navaho blanket,
and on it some old school-books and
papers and pens and ink; and right over
it a class picture in a frameâthe class
of 19ââ at Laurel academy!

âThe girl, as I said before, was looking
out of the window; just watching the
green creep over the prairie like an
emerald fire kindled by the sun, and
following the white road with her eyes as
far as she couldâthe road that leads to
the agency and the railroad and civilization.

âWhile she looked, a black speck
appeared away out on that road. The
speck grew bigger; soon it turned into a
[229]

lumber wagon drawn by two shaggy
ponies and driven by a tall, dark man in
the navy-blue uniform of the Indian
Police, with a shining shield on his
breast that flashed in the sun.

âIn a few minutes she heard the rattle
of wheels, and then the camp dogs ran
out to meet the good policeman with
welcoming barks, and the girl left her
window and went to the door that
opened on the green prairie. For there
are two doors in the yellow pine house; the
other one leads right into a log kitchen
where a tin coffee pot stood on the stove
and an old woman squatted close by,
tending a dear little baby, while the
babyâs mother, in a red dress made like
a kimono, was piecing a calico quilt.

âWell, the policeman pulled up his
rough little ponies right in front of the
door, threw down the lines and began
handing out beef and flour and other
[230]

things, which the woman in the red
kimono carried into the house. Then,
last of all, he put his hand in his breast
pocket, took out two letters and gave
them to the girl. After that, he saluted
and drove away again.

âThe girl sat down on the high door-sill
and read her letters; one made her
laugh out loud, to the great surprise of a
very small dog who had curled up on a
corner of her skirt. The letter was from
her friendâher dearest, far-away friend
in the New England hills. And now she
is going to sit down at her table with the
gay blanket cover, facing the class picture,
and write her answer.

âI hope this doesnât sound homesick,
Cynthia and Dorisâfor this letter is to
Doris, tooâbut you know how it is in
the spring; how the people and the things
that are far away seem to pull at your
heart. If I were back there in Laurel,
[231]

I should be dreaming of Dakota; and it

is
wonderful out here, girls! I wish you
could see the great, furry anemones and
the coltâs-foot and verbenas and all the
other purple and gold-colored things
that follow each other in a mad scamper
over the wavy bluffs. And it seems as if
I had never drawn a real, deep breath
anywhere but here. Itâs like the ocean
wind without the salt in it.

âAnd Iâm very fond of the people,
though they
are
provoking, sometimes.
They forget soâjust like children. And
Sir Walter mustnât be jealous, but you
ought to know my Shekaâthat means
âPoor Little Thing.â He never leaves
me if he can help it, and heâs just exactly
like a real person.

âI donât think I ever told you about
the time we had getting our Chaskay into
school. All the children have to go now
as soon as they are five, and the mothers
[232]

put off that fifth birthday just as long as
they can; but Chaskay was five last
summer, and in the fall the policeman
came for him to go to the boarding
school. Well, it was dreadful! Blue
Earth wailed, and Grandmother sang the
old Indian songs and shook her fist in the
policemanâs face, and the poor little
fellow was scared out of his wits and
screamed till I was frightened, myself.

âThen I had an idea, and I said
âWhy not take him every day to the
day school in Ring Thunderâs camp?
Heâs too little to leave his mother at
night; why, he canât even dress himself
yet.â

âSo it was settled, and we two take
turns carrying him on horseback, five
miles each way, morning and evening.
Blue Earth rides her spotted pony,
âBaby,â and I my iron-gray pacer, âOld
Soup,â the people call him, because he
[233]

goes from side to side, just like stirring
something in a pot.

âIt was glorious fun while the fine
weather lasted. I donât mind coyotes
a bit, and I got used to the rattlesnakes
after a while, remembering Ethanâs; but
a five-mile ride in a Dakota blizzard isnât
any fun, especially with a child on the
saddle in front of you, and you with your
hands full to keep him from freezing.
Itâs better to just let the horse take his
own course, anyway, when you canât see
the road a bit.

âBut the worst was this spring, when
the ice broke up on the White river.
You see, the schoolhouse is on the other
side of the river, and it was easy fording
it in the fall, when the water is low, and
easier still crossing on the ice; but one
windy March day the ice broke up while
we were on the further side.

âGood âOld Soup!â He just gathered
[234]

up his four feet into a bunch and jumped
from cake to cake, floating and swirling
around there in the black water, and once
or twice he missed his footing and went in
deep enough to wet my toes in the stirrups.
I can tell you, girls, I was glad
enough when he scrambled out on the
other side. And wasnât the boy brave?
He never uttered a sound!

âThere have been a great many sick
people this springâmostly with coughs
and consumption. I take them beef-tea
and milk gruel and rice and things, and
itâs best to stay and see them eat it if you
want to be sure. Especially if theyâre
women; they would so much rather give
it to the men.

âOne morning I was wakened out of a
sound sleep by a tap on the window-pane.
The sun was shining brightly, but I
looked at my dear little watch that always
hangs at the head of my bed, and it was
[235]

only five oâclock. What do you suppose
the woman said?âfor it was a poor, old
woman. âMy son is dying, and begs for
some light biscuit right away!â

âSo I got up and built the kitchen fire
before even Grandmother was stirring,
and the poor sick man had his last wish,
I guess, for he really did die. He was a
young man who had been away to school.

âThere are several returned students
here who are thankful to come and look at
my magazines and my photographs, and
sing hymns, and get me to explain things
to them. If I knew a little more, I would
try to have an evening class. They
always treat me with respect and call me
âOlder Sister.â Why, the other day one
of them even asked my advice about
getting married! What do you say to
that?

âThere are two or three I donât like
at allâhalf-breeds and white men.
[236]

One is an âassistant farmer;â they are the
men who are supposed to teach the
Indians farming, but sometimes I think
they donât do much but run errands for
the agent. This oneâs name is Jack
Pepper, and he visits this camp rather
often. I donât like his looks a bit, and I
try to be out of the way when he comes.

âI make a great many calls, for I
find the women like to have me come, and
besides, it keeps them up to the mark in
their housekeeping. Often the first thing
I see, long before I get to the house, is a
cloud of dust coming out of the front
door. Then I know that some one has
spied me coming, and is putting the one
room in company trim. By the time I
get there, it has not only been swept,
but the beds neatly made, with fresh
white pillow-cases, the dishes washed, the
cupboard put in order, and perhaps, if I
donât hurry, the youngest child has its
[237]

face scrubbed and a clean dress slipped
on over the old one.

âGive my love to allâespecially
darling Doris and all her family. I often
think of Grandma Brown. Youâll think
it funny, I suppose, but Grandmother
here reminds me of her a good deal. Not
her looks, of course, for she isnât neat and
nice a bit; her fingers are like claws and
her hair like gray feathers, almost; but
they both have a way of speaking right
out and saying things that bite.

âI shake hands with you in my heart,
as our people say.

â
Stella.

âP. S. If you happen to see Doctor
Ethan again, please give him my kind
regards.â

[238]

CHAPTER XVII

âPRAY FOR MY PEOPLE WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN!â

Of course, Stella couldnât put everything
into a letter, and one of the
things she didnât mention was a
regular proposal of marriage from the
old chief, Standing Cloud. She called
him âold,â but he was really a rather
fine-looking man of something over fifty.
He had âthrown awayâ one wife in
obedience to the law of the white man,
and had then lost the other soon afterward,
and he had missed no detail of the
appearance of the young school girl on
that fateful evening when she had gone
after Blue Earth to the dance house. For
the minute that she had stood there,
framed in the open window, the light of
[239]

the fire had struck full upon her winsome
face and tall, supple figure, bringing out
every line and feature with almost startling
distinctness.

Standing Cloud was not a particularly
progressive chief, but he knew a pretty
girl when he saw her. This was a girl of
his own people, after all, and an orphan
at that; everybody knew her history,
and such a man as he was not to be
daunted by a few years of schooling. She
had sense enough, probably, to appreciate
the honor he intended to do her.

His offer came in round-about fashion,
first through the grandmother, as was
fitting, and finally through Blue Earth,
who, with many giggles and much tossing
of the head, managed at last to convey
some inkling of it to the astonished and
indignant girl.

âThat old man!â she exclaimed, in
disgust. âI donât see how you can have
[240]

the face to repeat such a thing. Why,
how many wives has he had?â

âOnly two; and he hasnât
any
now;
and heâs a
chief
, you know.â

âThatâs quite enough. I donât wish
to hear another word about him as long
as I live!â

And Grandmother was left to smooth
over the affair as best she might, inventing
all manner of humble excuses to
cover the unheard-of rejection of a man
of such importance.

Then there was Moses Blackstone, a
serious young man who had passed some
years in the mission boarding-school as
its prize scholar, and was now a lay reader
in the village, and a regular caller at the
field matronâs home. In default of an
evening school, she innocently encouraged
him to sit by the hour at a corner of her
table, poring over some old school-book,
or stumbling over the long words in the
[241]

illustrated magazines that came from her
eastern friends. Occasionally he would
even write letters on her stationery and
frankly âborrowâ her stamps; but
Moses was really such a good young
man, and so earnest and humble, that
she lent him a helping hand whenever
she could, with scarcely more self-consciousness
than if he had been Chaskayâs
age.

If he took unusual pains with his dress
of late, the fact had escaped her, as also
that he was not at all a bad speaker in
his native Dakota. His English was inadequate,
and she always made him talk
to her in English, thus cruelly putting him
at a disadvantage.

Therefore Stella was honestly shocked
when one day Grandmother slyly pressed
into her hand a little folded note, and
upon carelessly opening it, she found a
regular love-letter, signed âMoses.â

[242]

To tell the truth, it was very prettily
and poetically expressed. âI am thinking
of something,â it began in the native
tongue. âI think of it night and day.
It will not let me rest nor sleep. It is
always of you that I think and of my
longing to be near you, and my wish
that we two might be one.â

Stella was really most unreasonable.
Her cheeks glowed and her black eyes
snapped. She tore the pleading little note
into tiny bits, and strewed it on the floor
before Grandmotherâs astonished old eyes.
That was her answer.

The missionary from the east who had
stepped into Father Waringâs old shoes
was far from finding them a fit. Though
he had been there for several years,
people still called him âthe new minister,â
a circumstance which tells its own
story to the discerning. Certainly his
[243]

manner was a trifle dry, even when his
intentions were most kind.

It seemed to our heroine, who we know
was sensitive to a fault, that everybody
looked at her critically, even coldly,
when she came to the agency church in
her trim, tailor-made suit and tasteful
little hat, and modestly took her seat
among the shawled and hatless Indian
women, or when, innocently conspicuous,
she walked the one street on âIssue Day,â
with business-like intentness upon her
various errands.

She was fairly happy, upon the whole,
among her own people at Cherry Creek,
but with the âwhite people,â who should
have welcomed her in all sincerity as a
fellow-worker, she felt lonely and ill at
ease. It was just as if the agent and his
employees, the minister, and most of all
their wives, were continually saying
among themselves:

[244]

âHow long do you suppose sheâll keep
it up? Too well-dressed and too self-possessed
for an Indian girl, anyway;
looks as if she thought too much of herselfâneeds
taking down a peg.â

This note of patronage and suspicion
was so unlike the general attitude toward
her in her New England home that Stella
couldnât help resenting it, and accordingly
held her well-groomed head a trifle higher
than before. There was only the little
day-school teacher in Ring Thunderâs
camp, Chaskayâs teacherâa simple,
good-hearted girl, not much older or
more experienced than Yellow Star herselfâthese
two got on together from the
first. Stella fell into the habit of going
over there on âOld Soupâ to spend her
Sundays, since she had actually come to
dread meeting any of the agency people,
and after poor Mosesâ unwelcome pretensions
she no longer cared to attend
[245]

the rather primitive but always reverent
little service in his large log cabin.

Long before September came round
again, Stella had learned that the annual
church convocation would meet at âour
agencyâ this year. This meant a great
gathering of perhaps a thousand Indians
who came from agencies hundreds of
miles distant, traveling overland, for
the most part, in picturesque canvas-topped
wagons loaded with camp equipage,
toward the appointed meeting-place.
It was the event of the year to all good
Christian Indians, bringing social as well
as spiritual inspiration, comfort, and
cheer.

Most of all, Stella looked forward to
meeting the Bishop, whose face of lofty
calm and sweetness, under its silvery
crown of hair, floated high like a white
cloud among dear memories of childhood
days. In those days, he had been from
[246]

time to time a guest under their roof,
giving to the very food he shared a
sacramental savor, and as a small, shrinking,
black-eyed maid she had never lost
the sense of a grave and gentle Presence
in the little white guest-chamber they
called the âBishopâs Room.â

And now the simple, loving preparations
were all complete. Not without
self-sacrifice, a feast had been provided
for the visitors, forage for the visitorsâ
horses, fresh vestments for the clergy, and
candles for the plain little altar. Near
the little Gothic church at the agency
rose a wide circle of teepees, looking as
if a flight of great, white birds had suddenly
alighted upon the sunburned grass.
Children ran joyously to and fro, men
gathered in groups, matronly women bent
over their camp-fires, and the soft music
of their greetings was in the air.

Before the church bell should ring to
[247]

summon the dark-skinned congregation
to their first service under the open sky,
the Bishop sat at meat in the modest
rectory, reaping the yearâs harvest of
rewards and perplexities, and now and
then dropping a quiet seed of counsel,
or straightening a tangled skein of
anxiety.

âAnd where is my little Stella?â he
asked presently, with a smile. âI understand
that she has come back to Cherry
Creek as a field matron.â

âI have heard no complaints of her
work, Bishop,â the missionary acknowledged,
frowning slightly nevertheless. âIâaâI
believe she is quite efficient;
however, we do not see her at church as
often as I could wish. Certainly I expected
her to-day, but we have seen
nothing of her.â

âThe truth is,â his wife added, rather
sharply, âit isnât easy to get into touch
[248]

with Stella Waring. Sheâwellâsheâs
almost too much the lady for Cherry
Creek. Too well-dressed, even; I fancy
people think she puts on airs. That good
Moses Blackstone was quite seriously
interested at one time; I really think
Stella treated him badly. Donât you
think, Bishop, itâs apt to spoil them a
littleâthis going east for an education?â

âSpoil them? Why, yes, my dear
lady; for hewers of wood and drawers of
water no doubt it may spoil them. We
must not expect them to slip back into
quite the old place,â suggested the Bishop,
mildly. âIt may even be possible that
she has outgrown our good Moses. Stella
was always a dear child; let me seeâitâs
just six years since I confirmed her.
I should like very much to see her again.â

The missionary parlor had quickly
filled, meantime, with the Bishopâs friends
and disciples of both races, among them
[249]

Stella herself, her lithe, girlish figure half
hidden behind a window curtain, her soft
eyes fastened eagerly upon the closed
door. At last a quick, decided step was
heard, and the gracious form of the
Bishop, as erect as of old but looking
to the girl much frailer and older than
she had remembered him, entered the
crowded room. His keen, kind eyes,
darting rapidly from one face to another,
flashed instant recognition into her own,
and almost before she knew it, Stella
found herself standing before him, all
a-tremble with timid happiness, and both
slim, brown hands drawn into the
Bishopâs strong clasp.

âCan this tall girl be my little Stella?â
she heard him say, while over a face in
repose a little sad and stern there broke
that smile like winter sunshineâa spirit
radiance that none who saw it can ever
forget. The rest fell back instinctively,
[250]

or else the Bishop drew her into a quiet
corner, and for a minute they two were
alone together.

âI hope I may hear that you are happy
in your work for our poor people?â began
the Bishop, very gently.

The quick tears shone in Stellaâs expressive
eyes.

âIâm sorry for themâI love them,â
she murmured; âbut oh, Bishop! I
do so miss dear Mother and Father
Waring!â

âI miss them, too,â the Bishop responded,
with such delicate sympathy
in his tones that she found the courage to
go on.

âI miss myâmy friends in Laurel,
too, Bishop! IâIâm afraid I donât
know enough for the work either; and
yet I do truly want to help.â

âOf course you do, my child,â responded
the Bishop. âWhy, the very
[251]

name we gave you in baptism signifies a
starâa light unto the Gentilesâa
candle that shall be set upon a candle-stick
to give light to all that are in the
house. That is what we have always expected
of you. And even the name the
old women gave you when they saved
you from the sad fate that overtook your
fatherâs peopleâThe-One-who-was-left-Alive!
You must have been kept alive
for some good purpose; always remember
that, Stella. Have you ever
thought that you might like to go
back to the East for more trainingâperhaps
for the training of a nurse?â he
went on, the keen eyes searching her
grave, downcast face.

Stella blushed more and more as it
flashed upon her for the first time that the
Bishop knew a good deal about the last
six years of her lifeâhad doubtless been
in correspondence with Laurel friends.

[252]

âIâI think I would, Bishop; only
not just yet. You see, I promised Blue
Earth. And besides,â she went on,
with desperate honesty, âthe white
people here seem to think I know too
much already. They seem not to like
me because IâI suppose I am different
from the other Indian girls.â

A sudden sternness drove the smile
from the Bishopâs face, and for a moment
or two he was quite silent, while the
sweet-toned bell in the church tower
began its call to sunset prayer.

âWe will talk of this again,â he said,
very gently. âGod bless you, my dear
child!â And he was gone.

With blurred eyes and dizzy brain
Stella blindly followed the throng of
gayly dressed, yet most quiet and reverent
worshipers, young men and maidens,
old men and children, mothers with babes
in arms, and took her place in the great
[253]

circle upon the bare prairie sod. In the
center of the ring the Bishop and his
ministers, many of whom showed earnest
dark faces above the snowy surplices,
read the prayers of the church and gave
utterance to the Christian hymns that
rose in a great wave of devotion to the
skies. The soft syllables of her native
Dakota tongue seemed to fit the dear,
familiar words, and no one who looked
upon that scene could ever have guessed
that only eighteen years before those
tawny hills had been black with armed
men, and that peaceful plain strewed with
the tortured forms of the dead and dying.

That needless, unpremeditated, pitiful
slaughter of helpless children and women,
so recklessly thrust in the way of the
all-conquering white man! Stella tried
not to dwell upon it; but whenever she
was deeply moved the prostrate figure
of the nameless mother would appear
[254]

before her eyesâan ample womanly
form shrouded in a dark blanket, and
always with the face hidden.

To-night the crowd and the music
and the beauty of the sunset and the
Bishopâs words together had so wrought
upon her, that the mother who sheltered
her from the bullets seemed very near,
and, forgetting pride and resentment and
a certain secret longing, Stella gave herself
up wholly to the deep magic of the
hour. In her soul there reverberated that
phrase Father Waring had once repeated
to them, as coming from the lips of one
of his native helpers:

âPray for my people when the sun
goes down!â

[255]

CHAPTER XVIII

FACING THE SUNRISE

âI donât see how they can
breathe
,
do you?â Stella prettily apologized
to the agency doctor, her bright
face a pleasant enough sight in his musty
old office, its shelves filled with unwholesome
drugs reaching from floor to ceiling.
Still a âfresh-airâ enthusiast, as in the
old Laurel days, she had insisted upon
holding long consultations with this official,
until he had simply been obliged to
rouse himself and forsake the old routine
of doling out these same drugs to a long
line of Indians,âso far, at least, as
Cherry Creek was concerned. Curious,
how that young woman would take a
personal interest in every single case.

Accordingly, he had entrusted to her
[256]

a shelf of simple remedies, and had fallen
into the habit of sending her full written
directions for the care of patients in her
neighborhood, especially the children.
After she had brought the village almost
single-handed through an epidemic of
measles, with not a single fatality, he did
not withhold from her the praise she certainly
deserved, for measles had been
regarded as generally fatal among the
camp children.

Not satisfied with her accomplishments
as a nurse, the young field matron had
ideas of her own, which, as confidence
grew, she imparted to her ally the doctor,
and through him they gradually sifted
into the office, and sometimes even appeared
on official estimates and requisitions.
It was, in fact, at her suggestion
that the assistant farmers throughout the
reservation had been instructed to teach
milking and feeding calves by hand, so
[257]

that there might be milk for young
children and motherless babies. An improved
brand of vegetable seeds supplied
in greater variety had likewise produced
good results. Perhaps her best idea was
that of building mud and stone chimneys
on to the unventilated log cabinsâa
plan that might have saved many lives if
there had been energy enough available
to put it into effect. To be sure, there
were plenty of tents for tuberculous
patients, but to suggest moving from a
house into a teepee would have been far
too reactionary.

Within eighteen months, she had become
quite the autocrat of her own little
villageâold Standing Cloud being
merely the figure-head. She had drilled
her small household with infinite patienceâand
not without a long siege with
Grandmotherâto such âcivilizedâ habits
as regular meal-times, sitting down
[258]

at table, and a weekly wash-day. The
childrenâs bath night was duly observed,
even though the ceremony must take
place in a wooden wash-tub beside the
kitchen stove.

After all this, it really was hard that
when their own darling babyâLittle
Girl, they called herâcame down with
acute bronchitis, Grandmother and even
Blue Earth suddenly rebelled, and obstinately
refused to have anything to do
with the âwhite manâs way.â The little
stove was kept constantly stuffed with
wood, and the baby lay gasping on the
bed, rolled in unsavory quilts, reeking
with heat and untouched for days by a
drop of water. To all Stellaâs pleas for
a warm bath, an open window, even in an
adjoining room, she received the sullen
reply:

âThis is no time for fooling. It didnât
matter when Little Girl was well, but
[259]

now she is very sick. If we are not careful
she will die!â

It was the dead of winter, but nevertheless
Stella rode the fifteen miles to the
agency on her faithful pony, saw the
doctor, and even persuaded him to ride
back with her. Backed by his authority,
she took bodily possession of the sick
child, gave it an alcohol rub, air, and
medicine, and watched through the long,
silent night.

Next morning, Little Girl was plainly
worse. Grandmother crawled out-of-doors
and tied a rag of red calico to a poleâher
pitiful, unspoken prayer to the
Powers! Her hoarse voice could be heard
in the pauses of the wind, chanting a
weird and mournful song.

Stella inwardly trembled at the sound,
and all the spirits of her ancestors seemed
to upbraid her from the dull, resentful
eyes of the tormented mother, who sat
[260]

huddled on the bed like a crouching animal,
staring at the intruder with a look
that said plainly:

âYou have an Indian skin, but a white
heart. If my child dies,
you
will have
killed her!â

The girl shut her eyes and her ears, and
she, too, prayed.

But she didnât forget when the time
came to give the doctorâs medicine.
Hours passed like a bad dream, until, as
she bent over the loved little form, a
moment was enough to note the easier
breathing, the beads of sweat on the
pinched baby face. And that terror had
gone by.

It was now late August, and no rain
had fallen on the reservation for many
weeks. The waving sea of prairie grass,
vivid in May as a green gem, was now of
a rufous brown. Water-holes were sucked
[261]

dry; the smaller creeks had quite forsaken
their sandy beds, and many of the
people had to drive their cattle and horses
long miles to water, every morning and
evening.

The âLittle Fatherâ sat humped up
in his office chair, with his coat off, discontentedly
signing a batch of official
papers and heaping objurgations on the
weather, when Blue-Coat unceremoniously
made his way in at the wide-open
door and thrust a letter under the agentâs
nose. The letter was from Cherry Creek.

âThere is a large prairie fire to the
west of us and the wind is blowing strong
in our direction. I am sure the camp is
in danger. Only the women and two or
three old men are at home. Please send
help at once.

âRespectfully,

â
Stella Waring
.â

[262]

âUmph!â he grunted, rousing himself
a trifle, however. âThat all so, Lone
Bull? Well, tell Pepper to step here
a minute. Hello, Jack! hereâs a windfall
for you. The little field matron
out at Cherry Creek wants to be saved
from a prairie fire. Thatâs a Number
One allotment sheâs picked outâbetter
get a move on at once. Iâm looking
for a tenderfoot from the East to-day;
teamâs just gone to the landing after
him; may take a drive out that way later
on. Good luck to you!â

When Jack Pepper pulled up his steaming
span in front of Stellaâs home, the
girl was out with âOld Soupâ and a
rusty plow, trying, with the help of Blue
Earth and one or two others, to drive a
furrow around the threatened camp. But
it was evident that their unaccustomed
hands were making hard work of it. The
[263]

advancing line of smoke and flame had
drawn perceptibly nearer; a hot blast
was blowing directly in their faces, and
the red sun swam in an angry haze. The
situation looked fairly serious.

âHey, Stella! so you had to send for
me, at last!â was the young manâs
familiar greeting.

The girl looked past him with unseeing
eyes. âI wrote to the
agent
,â she replied,
shortly.

âScared out of your wits, Iâll bet!
Well, if I help you out of this scrape,
what am I going to get for it, eh?â he
persisted, coming closer.

Stella flashed one glance at the coarse
face unpleasantly near her own, then at
the winking red line of fire driven straight
toward them on the wings of a strong
wind. The fire was preferable, so far
as she was concerned; but there were
Blue Earth and her terrified babies and
[264]

poor, helpless old Grandmother! There
were many others in the same plight.
Doubtless they could escape by hasty
flight; but these poor huts held their
little all on earth, and must they be
abandoned? What was to be done?

âWill you take this plow? or shall I?â
she blazed out. âYou can see for yourself
thereâs no time to lose.â

âWell, of all the high-anâ-mighty airs!âand
her nothinâ more than a squaw,
when allâs said anâ done,â muttered the
man. âSay, Stella, you wait till the
Major hears of your goinâs-on; âtendinâ
Injun dances late at night and all that
sort of thing! I know more about you
than you think I do, and maybe youâll be
sorry yet you tried to turn me down.â

Stella, choking with wrath, caught up
the plow-handles again without a word
and chirruped to the patient pony. As
her eyes mechanically swept the horizon,
[265]

though without hope of aid, they descried
a rapidly driven team approaching from
the direction of the agency. Jack saw
her face lighten suddenly, and saw, too,
what had done it. In hot haste he jerked
a plow from the back of his wagon,
hitched his waiting team, and started a
furrow both wide and deep a few rods
from the cabins, whose owners were
running hither and thither in helpless
terror.

Half-blinded with smoke, and quivering
with outraged pride, Stella dropped
her plow to confront the agent and
anotherâa tall, well-knit youth who was
hurrying forward with both hands outstretched.

âEthanâwhy, Ethan!â

âI seem to be just in time, again,
Stella,â was all he said, and the plow
started with a running jerk as the gray
pony felt a manâs hand on the bit.

[266]

Two hours later, when the danger was
over, and the smoking prairie lay black
in the path of the setting sun, two young
people stood side by side on a bluff
overlooking the Indian camp.

âWhat was that fellow saying to you
just before we came up, anyway? I
thought I noticed a spark in somebodyâs
eye that was considerably hotter than the
prairie fire,â Ethan slyly observed.

âHe â¦ he doesnât know any better,
I suppose,â Stella murmured.

âLooked to me as though he needed
kicking, all right,â the young man cheerfully
assented, and something in the set
of his jaw and the swing of his athletic
shoulders hinted that Jack Pepper would
do well to avoid his immediate neighborhood.

âWell, never mind him now. He isnât
worth it,â pursued her old friend. âDonât
you want to hear all the news from home?
[267]

About the girlsâand dear old Uncle Si?
And your little âwild orphan?â You
know, Iâm an orphan myself, Stella.â

âBut youâre grown up,â she returned,
not looking at him.

âSo has the fawn grown upâand
taken to the woods,â laughed the young
man. âCome, Stella, Iâve brought you
a message. Guess who itâs from. No,
not Cynthia this time; not even the
old Doctor. Iâve brought you a message
fromâMiss Sophia!â

He paused to observe the effect of his
words, in the soft, black eyes that seemed
to widen and deepen gloriously under his
steady gaze.

âYes, Miss Sophia isnât so young as
she wasâand thereâs something in her,
after all, thatâs stronger than prejudice
and pride. It must have been there
always, buried so deep down that nobody
ever found it out. She simply canât hold
[268]

out any longer, all alone so. She wouldnât
write, dear, because she couldnât; she
sent me all this long way to find you, and
tell you that she wants you to come
home. Stella, will you come?â

âMiss Sophia wants me,â breathed
Yellow Star. It seemed impossibleâunbelievable.
In these few, short years,
many people had wanted her, or seemed
to want her; but
Miss Sophia
!

For a full minute neither spoke. In
the silence, the magical Dakota sunset
blossomed rosy-red above the pair, who
stood, as it were, cut off from all human
companionship, a burned-out world under
their feet, their heads in a paradise of
color and ecstasy.

â
And all thatâs best of dark and bright

Meets in her aspect and her eyes!
â

Ethan hummed the old song under his
breath.

[269]

âOh!â the Indian girl burst out at
last, with something of the old frank
impetuosity. âDo you know, Ethan, I
seem to be two people again, just as in
those first months in Laurel, when you
teased me about having so many namesââ(Ethan
gently shook his head). âIâm
pulled two ways at once; I so want to
really belong, and I canât tell where I
belong! I know, now, that I canât do for
my people what I once thought I could,
here on the reservation; and yet, isnât
it my place? I wonder what the Bishop
would say.â

âWell, what
did
he say?â sturdily
responded Ethan.

âHe didâyes, he
did
tell me once I
had better go back for more trainingâto
learn to be a nurse.â

âWell, isnât taking care of Miss Sophia
pretty good training? I believe that just
now, at any rate, you belong with her,â
[270]

he answered promptly, with a masculine
finality that steadied her swimming
thoughts. âA lonely, loveless old woman
needs you; you are all she has. Come
home, dear; come home!â

âBlue Earth told me yesterday that
sheâs going to be married againâto
Moses Blackstone.
She
wonât need me
any more,â half laughed, half sobbed the
girl, recalling the dumb pleading that had
so irritated her in those eyes of Mosesâ.
She was all womanâour little Stella,
and the personal note would not be
denied. âIt canât be just yet, of course;
I must take a month or two to wind
up everything; butâyesâIâll come!â

They had turned their backs upon the
tiny, primitive village, and were facing
the eastern horizon, remote and lovely in
the transforming after-glow.

âAnd you graduate from the medical
[271]

college when, Ethan? Isnât it next year?
Are you really going to settle down in
Laurel?â

âDoctor Brown is anxious to divide
his practice, but I havenât given him my
answer yet,â responded Ethan, his serious
eyes upon the soft, averted cheek that
had at last begun to burn with a delicate
consciousness.

âYou see, Stella, the
place
doesnât
matter much,â he went on, with tender
confidence. âAny place holds duties to
fill a lifetime; itâs the
spirit
that really
counts. A doctorâs heart ought to be
as large as all humanity, donât you think
so? I may go east; I may go west. I
only know one thing surely â¦ I must
follow my Star!â

âI allers sort oâ mistrusted that Injuns
was folks.â This was Grandma Brownâs
comment, when she heard that Stella
[272]

had been sent for at last. âSeems like
thereâs a sight of human nater in most
all of us,âeven in that Sophiâ Spellman!â

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

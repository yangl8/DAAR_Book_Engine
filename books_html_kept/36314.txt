The Radio Boys Rescue the Lost Alaska Expedition

CHAPTER I.âTHE LOST EXPEDITION.

âStrange that you boys should be talking about
the âLost Expedition.ââ

âOh, hello, Dad. Why strange?â

âBecause I have just come from a conference
with a man who knows all there is to know about
it. And he was telling meââ.â

Mr. Hampton advanced from the doorway into
the sitting room, and looked at the faces of the
three boys in turn. They were his son, Jack, and
the latterâs chums, Bob Temple and Frank Merrick,
who together had gone through many adventures
related in other books of âThe Radio Boysâ series.

It was the sitting room of a suite in a Seattle
hotel. Here the four, arriving from South
America, after finding and losing âThe Enchanted

4

City of the Incasâ as told of in âThe Radio Boys
Search for the Incasâ Treasure,â were ensconced
on their way to their Long Island homes.

âWell, Dad, what was this man telling you?â

âYes, Mr. Hampton, tell us,â added Frank
âWeâre curious.â

âWhat do you know about the âLost Expedition?ââ
countered Mr. Hampton. âI stood in the
doorway unobserved a moment and heard you discussing
it.â

âNothing but what this article in the Sunday
paper tells,â said big Bob, grumblingly, âAnd the
fellow that wrote this yarn didnât know very much.
Itâs mostly talk.â

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âSpeculation, I suppose,â he said. âWell, thatâs
the best the writer could do. The facts arenât
generally known. However, wait a minute until I
get off this wet coat and get into something comfortable.
Itâs raining again.â

âRaining again?â said Jack. âDoesnât it ever
stop here?â

âOh, thatâs just the Seattle Winter,â said his
father. âThe rains are necessary, and, really, they
are so mild one doesnât mind them after a time.â

âHuh,â grumbled big Bob. âIâd think these
people would grow web feet.â

âLook here,â said Mr. Hampton, after getting into

5

his smoking jacket and slippers. âWhat I learned
today ought to interest you boys.â

âWhy, Dad?â Jack leaned forward eagerly.

âWell, wait until I tell you a bit about it,â said
his father. âThen youâll see.â

Then, while the three young fellows paid close
attention, Mr. Hampton proceeded to relate the
story of the âLost Expeditionâ so-called, the expedition
headed by Thorwald Thorwaldsson, the
Norwegian explorer, which had outfitted at Seattle
the previous Spring, set out for an unnamed destination
in the Far North, and had never been heard
of since.

A great deal of secrecy as to its objects had
attended the departure of this expedition in its
sturdy schooner, and many were the wild guesses
and surmises concerning it advanced in the papers
and among the hangers-on along the Seattle waterfront.
Some said confidently that the expedition
was going to attempt to reach the North Pole by
airplane, for an airplane was carried dismantled on
the schooner. Others declared the object sought
was gold. And, in this regard, the vague rumors
of vast gold fields found in the past by this or that
old-time prospector who died without making his
secret public, were brought to light and furbished
up with a wealth of apocryphal detail in order to
bear out the contention.

6

âBut none of these assumptions,â said Mr.
Hampton, âwas correct. The real object of the
expedition never was made public, for the very
good reason that none of those in the knowâand
their numbers are fewâever betrayed a word, or
hint, of the secret.â

âAnd you know it?â asked Jack, with quickened
interest.

Mr. Hampton nodded, and smiled teasingly.

âCome on, Mr. Hampton, tell us,â said Frank.

âYou better, Mr. Hampton, or heâll burst with
curiosity,â advised big Bob. âShow that boy a
secret and heâs not content until he takes it apart.â

âHow about yourself?â said Frank, indignantly.
âI suppose you donât care to hear, hey? Oh, no.â

Mr. Hampton interrupted.

âWait a minute, Bob. No need to perjure yourself.
I know all you boys are eager to know the
answer to the mystery of the âLost Expedition.â
Well, I can tell it to you in one word. It isâââ

He paused. Then added:

âOil.â

âOil?â

All three listeners asked the question as if in one
breath. Big Bob was no less inquisitive than the
others, despite his twigging of Frank for his
curiosity.

Mr. Hampton nodded.

7

âYes,â he said. âOil.â

For a moment he was silent, collecting his
thoughts. Then he leaned forward, cleared his
throat and continued:

âPerhaps my words are a disappointment to you.
The Northland for you, probably, is invested in a
mysterious glamor. It means either men struggling
through incalculable hardships to win their way to
the North Pole, to the top of the world, or else
fighting against all the mighty forces of Nature in
a grim, ice-locked land to wrest a stream of golden
wealth from the bosom of the Earth.

âAh, yes,â he continued, smiling slightly, âI
know how you feel. Whenever our preconceived
and heroic notions are upset we feel a sense of disappointment.
But, consider for a moment, the
meaning of this matter. Here, far away in the
Northland, in a remote district to which so far as
known only two white men have ever penetrated,
lies a mighty river flowing north into the Arctic
Ocean, along the banks of which are such vast
deposits of oil that it oozes through the soil and into
the river to such an extent that the river in reality
is a river of oil and never freezes.â

âA river of oil that never freezes, Dad?â said
Jack. âDo you expect us to believe that?â

âAnd flowing north, too?â said Frank, whose

8

quick mind had seized upon that point of contrariety
in Nature.

Mr. Hampton smiled.

âWell, boys, it is hard to believe, Iâll admit,â he
said. âYet that this river does flow north is undoubted.
That it never freezes, however, is an
exaggeration. The truth is, probably, that at spots
so much oil seeps into the water that soft spots are
formed.

âHitherto,â he continued, âthere have been only
two rivers known that flow north into the Arctic
in that regionâthe MacKenzie and the Coppermine,
along the shores of which are vast deposits
of copper that some day, undoubtedly, will be
opened up to exploitation. However, this other
northward-flowing river in the midst of a vast oil
field must now be added to the list, if the word of
the lone explorer is to believed, of the one man who
has been there and lived to return with the tale.â

âBut I thought you said this river was known to
two white men, Dad?â objected Jack.

âSo I did. So I did,â declared his father. âAnd
two there wereâCameron and Farrell. But
Cameron died on the trip to the outside, and Farrell
alone lived despite incredible hardships, to finally
reach Edmonton with the tale. Now he, too, is
goneâfor he was a member of Thorwaldssonâs âLost
Expedition.â

9

âWhen he reached Edmonton, a thriving
Canadian city, Farrell, an adventurous fellow who
at one time had worked in the Southwestern oil
fields as an employee of the syndicate of independent
operators which once employed me there as
superintendent, realized the value of his discovery
and kept his mouth closed until he got in touch with
Anderson, the big man of the syndicate. Anderson
saw at once the importance of the find. But he
also saw that Farrellâs marvelous oil field would
virtually have to be rediscovered before steps to
develop it could be taken. For, in struggling
through to the outside, Farrell had suffered the loss
of his compass, had been turned about in Winter
fogs, had lain delirious for a long period in the
igloo of friendly Eskimos within the Arctic Circle
and, in general, had suffered so many hardships
that his mind was clouded and he had no clear idea
of where lay this oil field.

âAnderson, however, placed such faith in Farrellâs
report that he decided to outfit an expedition
to retrace the footsteps of Farrell and Cameron
into the Arctic in the hope of thus once more coming
upon the oil field. Inasmuch as they had gone
in through Alaska, that was the way which Thorwaldssonâs
expedition took.â

Mr. Hampton paused. Jack, who had been eyeing
his father closely, now put a hand on his arm.

10

âAnd now what, Dad?â he asked.

âNow Anderson wants me to attempt to go after
the âLost Expeditionâ and try to relocate the oil
fields as well as find some trace of Thorwaldsson,â
said Mr. Hampton.

âI thought so,â said Jack, in a tone of satisfaction.
âWhen do we start?â

âWe?â Mr. Hampton chuckled. âI like that. Just
as cool as you please about it, too. We? Well, well.â

âDo we leave at once?â asked Jack, imperturbably,
not one whit disturbed by his fatherâs
pleasantry.

Mr. Hampton shook his head.

âWhether I take you at all is questionable,â he
said. âCertainly, I have no intention of going at
once. If I go at all, it will not be until the Arctic
Summer begins.â

âMeantime, I suppose, Iâm to return to Yale.â

âYes, youâve missed a half year, thanks to our
adventures in search of the Incasâ treasure in South
America, but that is no reason why you should miss
the balance of the term. Iâll tell you what,â he
added, taking pity on the three, âif you fellows go
back to college and study hard to make up for lost
time until Summer, and if the âLost Expeditionâ is
still lost at that time, why, Iâll see what can be
done.â

âHurray,â cried Jack. âThatâs a promise.â

11
CHAPTER II.âSETTING OUT FROM NOME.

âWell, boys, where do we go from here?â

It was Frank who asked the question, and he sat
on a heap of luggage on the beach at Nome, with
Jack and Bob beside him looking alternately at the
mountain beyond the Alaskan outpost and at Mr.
Hampton deep in conversation with a short sturdy
figure of a man, clad in khaki breeches, high leather
boots and a flannel shirt, a short distance away.
The figure was that of Tom Farnum, scout of the
independent oil interests at Nome.

It was Summer, and Summer in Alaska as the
boys were beginning to realize meant hot weather,
indeed. All had their coats off, and were perspiring.
Only an hour before they had been put ashore
by the steamer from Seattle, and Mr. Hampton
had left them on the beach with their luggage while
he went in search of Tom Farnum, who had failed
to meet them at the landing as they had expected.

âWhere do we go from here?â Jack repeated

12

Frankâs question. âWell, if you ask me, almost
any place would be better than Nome.â

He looked with disfavor at the little town
sprawling at the base of the mountain.

âNot just what I expected,â he said. âIâve heard
of Nome all my life, it seems, and now, just look at
it. Why, itâs hardly a spot on the map.â

âBut what a history it has had, Jack,â said Frank.
âDonât judge by appearances too much. Remember
this town has seen the Gold Rush.â

âI wonder what Dad is talking about,â said Jack,
ignoring Frankâs remark.

âProbably discussing how soon we can get away,â
said big Bob, speaking for the first time. âAt any
rate,â he added, âI see your father and his companion
pointing to that gasoline schooner off shore.â

At this moment, their doubts were resolved, for
Mr. Hampton and his companion ended their conversation
and approached the boys.

âWell, boys, weâll soon be under way,â said Mr.
Hampton. Whereupon he introduced Farnum all
around. The latter was a prepossessing man with
a weather-beaten face and a grizzled mustache,
above which jutted a promontory of a nose between
deep-set, wide, blue eyes.

âThat is our schooner out there,â Mr. Hampton
continued, indicating the boat to which Bob earlier
had drawn attention. âMr. Farnum,â he added,

13

âhas stated casually around Nome that he is taking
a party of hunters up the MacKenzie. Weâll get
away at once, as nothing is to be gained by a stay
in Nome and as, furthermore, we wish to avoid
inquiries into our aims. The story Farnum has
told will do well enough.â

Farnum nodded.

âJust a white lie,â he said, grinning. âNo use
letting the curious know all your secrets.â

Then followed an hour of brisk work, at the end
of which period the luggage was safely stowed
aboard the gasoline schooner, and its screw began
to turn. As the little vessel began to throb and
draw away from Nome, the boys leaned overside
and watched the prospect dwindle in the distance
until the houses seemed like toys and the mountainside
like a painted backdrop in the theater.

âHurray,â cried Bob, at last, âweâre off for the
Great Unknown.â

âYes,â agreed Frank, âI really feel that way, too.
All the way up from Seattle, I felt as if I were
nothing more than a tourist, traveling a beaten
route. But this, well, this is different.â

After that they were silent a long time, while the
schooner shook and throbbed and steadily pushed
its way up the coast, each boy busy with his thoughts.
Yet those thoughts were much the same.

Following that eventful discussion in Seattle, on

14

their return from South America and their adventures
there in The Enchanted City of the Incas, they
had gone back to Yale and studied hard to make up
for lost time in the first half of the term. All three
were clever and had the knack of concentrating at
their tasks, and all as a consequence had succeeded
in making up back work in classroom and lecture.
As a result they had entered the succeeding term,
or at least were prepared to do so, without conditions.
This was a matter for congratulation, indeed,
and deserving of especial reward.

That reward had been theirs. For Mr. Hampton
and Mr. Temple both decided that their respective
sons and Frank, Mr. Templeâs ward, should be
permitted to accompany Mr. Hampton on his trip
to attempt to find some trace of the âLost Expeditionâ
and of the reputed oil field in search of which
Thorwaldsson had set out.

âFarnum is reputed a wizard in knowledge of
the Northland,â Mr. Hampton had explained to
Mr. Temple, âand, as a consequence, I do not consider
that we will run any danger. Our greatest
danger, of course, would be to become trapped in
the Far North in the Fall and be prevented by the
rigors of Winter from regaining the outside. For
I do not intend to spend the Winter there. Instead,
I hope to be back in civilization by the early Fall.

âThat,â he added, âwill give us plenty of opportunity

15

to seek traces of the âLost Expedition.â I
have been in communication with Farnum. His
plan is for us to push up the MacKenzie to one of
its tributaries, and then strike eastward. We will
leave the gasoline schooner to make its way back to
Nome, while we push on overland, lightening our
journey on rivers and lakes, in the hope of finding
the River of Oil flowing north.

âIf we are unsuccessful, when the seasonal warnings
of approaching Winter come, we will turn to
the southeast and come out in northern Canada.

âThe boys are hard and fit, and such a trip will
be of inestimable value for them. It will make
them self-reliant and teach them to depend upon
themselves. Not that they are not in a fair way to
be youths of that sort already,â he added, smiling.
âIf you could have seen them in South America,
George, it would have done your heart good.â

âI know, I know,â said Mr. Temple, shaking his
head slightly, and smiling. âSeveral years ago, that
time when you were captive in Mexico and they set
out to rescue youââ

âYes, and did,â supplied Mr. Hampton.

âAnd did,â agreed Mr. Temple. âWell, they
showed the stuff that was in them then. And the
very same Summer, when I took them to San
Francisco on what I considered was going to be a

16

little pleasure trip combining a bit of business with
sight-seeing, andââ

âAnd you became involved with the Chinese
smugglers, and imprisoned, and ended up by busting
up their showââ

âYes,â resumed Mr. Temple, âand ended up by
bringing the whole outfit into the hands of Uncle
Samâs men. Well, I can tell you, they certainly
showed their calibre.â

âSo, I reckon it will be all right to take them
along on this trip,â said Mr. Hampton.

âI suppose so,â agreed Mr. Temple. âBut innocent
as it looks now, I have my doubts. I have
my doubts. Wherever those three boys are found,
there you can look for things to move fast. Trouble
courts them, it seems to me.â

Accordingly, the boys had been told they would
be taken on the trip into the Far North. And wildly
excited they had gone about their preparations.
Jack, the keenest radio enthusiast, was all for packing
up radio field equipment of every sort right at
home. But his father had dissuaded him, pointing
out that Seattle was a large city and there everything
necessary in the way of an outfit could be
purchased, thus saving the trouble and expense of
transporting overland to the Pacific port.

âAll right, Dad,â Jack had agreed. âBut, remember,
the selection of the radio equipment is to

17

be left to the fellows and me. Weâve had a lot of
experience with the value of radio when in a tight
place, especially in South America, and we want to
put that experience to use and be prepared for every
contingency this time.â

To this Mr. Hampton readily had agreed, with
the result that in Seattle the three boys had revelled
in the radio equipment stores, which they found
well stocked, as the use of radio had developed
greatly on the Pacific.

In consequence, their outfit included radio field
equipment of the most powerful, yet most compact,
designs. For while Mr. Hampton fully realized the
value of having the very best yet he had issued a
solemn warning that bulk must be considered.

âWe will have to travel as lightly as consistent
with safety and the purpose of our expedition,â he
had said. âSo donât pile up anything too heavy or
bulky, or it will have to be discarded.â

Jack knew well that the distance which can be
covered with a radiophone transmitter is only about
one-fourth as great as that of a wireless telegraph
transmitter having the same input of initial current.
Therefore, as a means of sending messages, supposedly
for aid, over long distances, the wireless
telegraph would be the better, inasmuch as equipment
for it would be less bulky to transport than
equipment for transmitting the human voice. Nevertheless,

18

he was reluctant to place their sole dependence
upon the wireless telegraph.

âYou see, Dad,â he had pointed out to his father,
when the outfit was being assembled, âto reach the
outside we shall have to depend upon wireless telegraph.
But we will also need the radiophone for
this reason: that each one of us ought to have a
means of calling the main party in case we become
separated through going on scouting or hunting
expeditions, or for any reason.â

âWell, that sounds sensible,â his father had
agreed. âGo ahead with your plans, but, remember,
hold down the bulk.â

The result was that equipment capable of telegraphing
five hundred miles was assembled, but also
Jack made up five light field sets of radio, one for
each of their party and for Farnum, which the user
could pack in his clothing and which had a radius
up to twenty-five miles. The instrument was Jackâs
now famous ring radio, worn on the finger, with a
setting only one inch by five-eighths of an inch.
Formerly an umbrella as aerial had been employed
but Jack had done entirely away with that in his
improved set.

âWell, fellows,â said Jack, at last, as Nome faded
entirely from view, âI wonder what lies ahead. I
wonder whether Thorwaldssonâs expedition was
stricken down by a plague, which seems hardly

19

likely, as in that case surely somebody would have
managed to get word to the outside by wireless or
airplane, or whether it fell victim to a surprise
attack by Indians at night, as I understand from
Dad that Farnum believes.â

âIs that so,â said Frank, in surprise. âThatâs the
first I heard of that.â

âYes,â said Jack. âDad told me of it when we
were coming aboard this schooner. He said it was
the first intimation Farnum had given him that such
might be the case, and also his first intimation that
there were hostile Indians in this country into which
we are going. If it werenât too late, he told me, he
would have turned back rather than imperil us, as
it is, we shall go pretty warily and try to steer clear
of the hostile Indian country.â

âWhew,â said Bob, âthis sounds interesting, hey,
what?â

His eyes began to shine.

âOld Bob. Always ready for a fight,â said Frank.
âWell, letâs give him one.â

And incontinently, he and Jack fell upon the big
fellow and a tussle followed that ended only when
they almost fell overboard.

20
CHAPTER III.âIN THE WILDERNESS.

âWell, boys, tomorrow we leave the schooner.â

It was Tom Farnum who made the announcement
over dinner which was eaten on deck. The
boat was anchored offshore, far up the Hare Indian
River, one of the great tributaries of the MacKenzie.
How long it was since they had left Nome none
could tell, for in that land of perpetual daylight it
was hard to keep track of time.

âTomorrow,â said big Bob, âwhen is tomorrow?â

He looked at the sun which was still high, despite
the lateness of the hour, and would make only an
ineffectual attempt to dip below the horizon at midnight,
before resuming its upward climb.

Everybody laughed.

âWhat a topsy turvy land,â said Jack. âWell, I,
for one, will be glad to go ashore and stretch my
legs. Wonderful as the trip has been so far, Iâm
eager to get started.â

âSame here,â agreed Frank.

21

Little of moment had occurred to interrupt the
monotony of the trip up the coast and along the
northern edge of Alaska and the North American
continent to the mouth of the MacKenzie. Of
course, occasional ice floes had been encountered and
the little schooner had been compelled to make wide
detours. But that was to be expected in that Far
Northern latitude.

In fact, when they had arrived at the mouth of
the MacKenzie, the ice was only recently dissipated
from the great river. There, at a dock where a little
sidewheel steamer that plied on the MacKenzie in
Summer was tied up for repairs, they had replenished
their stock of gasoline and then continued the ascent,
passing between willowed banks, where huddled
occasional trading posts surrounded by native villages,
with the snow-capped mountain peaks always
in the distance.

Then they had reached the mouth of the Hare
Indian River and soon had put beyond them all appearance
of the presence of man.

âThis is the way Thorwaldssonâs party expected
to go,â Farnum had said. âFor it was this route
which Farrell and Cameron, the two prospectors,
followed on their way in. They were prospecting
for gold, you know, had no idea of finding oil. It
was their original intention to strike northeast
across the numerous streams at the head of the Hare

22

Indian in search of gold. And Farrell reported,
when he reached the outside, that he had found
traces and, in fact, several sizable pockets of gold.â

Accordingly they pushed on up the Hare Indian
a number of days until, in fact, the extra supplies of
gasoline which had been taken aboard on leaving the
MacKenzie dwindled to the point where it became
advisable for the party to go ashore in order that
the schooner might turn about and have sufficient
fuel to make its way downstream to the supply
depot.

It was a period of time that, in fact, however,
could hardly be considered in terms of days. So far
north had the party come that the sun shone perpetually.
It was only at midnight, for a brief space,
that it dipped to the horizon.

And what a gorgeous time it had proven to be for
all concerned, but especially for the boys. As the
powerful little schooner forged ahead, there was not
a bend the rounding of which did not afford a surprise.
Sometimes it would be caribou or reindeer,
probably an escape from some Eskimo herd, which
would be surprised standing in the water, and breaking
for the timber on the bank at their approach.
Again brown bear would be seen on the bank, or
beaver swimming strongly across the stream. As
for fishing, it was an Izaak Walton paradise. All
Bob, Frank and Jack did for hours on end was to

23

lean overside with hooks baited with bacon rind
dangling in the water astern, and pull in speckled
beauties. And many a meal was made, too, on
wild duck or geese, picked off with a light rifle.

Then came the time when Tom Farnum announced
that they would stay ashore on the morrow.
And little sleep did the boys have that night, as they
lay awake on deck, whispering to each other, an
awning shading them from the sun.

Early the next morning they went ashore with their
outfit, and then watched the gasoline schooner throb
off downstream, around the last bend, and out of
sight. As it disappeared, for the first time there came
to each of the three boys the feeling of isolation
natural to their situation. The last settlement was
two hundred miles behind them. They were going
into the great unknown, into the regions marked
âUnexploredâ on the maps of that great northern
rim of the North American continent.

True, the weather was fine now and the country
green and pleasant about them. But how long would
that endure? What if they were beset by oncoming
Winter before they could make their way to the outside?
What if they were attacked by hostile Indians?
What obscure fate had met the Thorwaldsson expedition,
traces of which they sought?

Into the mind of each thronged such thoughts, as

24

they stood in unwonted silence. Then Mr. Hampton
called to them.

âNo time for day-dreaming. Each man to his
job.â

With him Tom Farnum had brought two trusted
men. They hailed from Nome, but were old-timers
who had been up and down Alaska for many years.
Both were men of forty, sober, steady fellows who
would be useful in helping distribute the burden of
packs, and would, moreover, be of inestimable value
in keeping the party supplied with game as well as
in almost any situation that might arise. They were
grizzled, weather-beaten men of medium height, both
with stout frames, and because of their long
existence in the lonesome north little given to talking.
Their names were Dick Fairwell and Art
Bowman, and they were âDickâ and âArtâ to each
other and the other members of the party. The boys
had taken a liking to both.

Two light canoes had been brought along from
Nome, lashed to the deck of the schooner, and in
these the seven set out. The boys with Dick occupied
one canoe, the other three men with a larger
portion of the luggage the other.

When everything was in readiness, following a
light breakfast on the bank, the two canoes set out,
that containing Farnum, Mr. Hampton and Art
taking the lead. About ten miles upstream a rapids

25

was encountered, and around this the first portage
was made. Then once more they took to the water.

Day followed day, in this fashion, as they pushed
steadily forward, until almost a week had elapsed.
On the fifth day Tom Farnum let out a whoop of
joy and headed his canoe for the right bank of the
stream at a little gravelly beach. His sharp eye had
detected a small cairn of stones on the edge of the
brush, and when the others came up with him and
stepped from their craft he was busily demolishing
the stones comprising the mound.

âA marker,â was the only explanation he vouchsafed.
âMust have been left by Thorwaldsson. Ah.â

At the exclamation he stood upright, holding a
small metal box in his hand. The lid was rusted on,
and in his impatience, Farnum whipped out a knife
and gouged it off while the others crowded around
him. Inside was a fold of oilskin, which he ripped
open. A folded paper was revealed, which he opened.
Then he read aloud the message thereon.

âItâs from Thorwaldsson all right. Listen,â he
said, and read:

âPlease notify Mr. Otto Anderson, Ashland
Block, Seattle, Wash., that I passed here July 2.
Party intact with exception of crew sent as he ordered.
Farrell says we are on right track.

â
Thorwaldsson.
â

26

âWhat does he mean by that reference to the
crew?â asked Jack.

âWell,â said Farnum, glancing at Mr. Hampton,
âas your father knows, that is one of the unexplained
and puzzling facts of the situation, that about the
ship. You see, a skeleton crew was to be left aboard
the ship and it was to winter in the MacKenzie. But
of ship or crew, we have found no trace. Search for
the ship was prosecuted at the first opportunity this
Spring, but it had disappeared. I made a trip up the
MacKenzie myself, but the only information I could
gather was an occasional rumor at a trading post
that a schooner had gone by, on its way out, at
night. A ship that might have been the Viking,
Thorwaldssonâs craft. That was last Fall. Perhaps,
the skeleton crew feared to winter in the MacKenzie
and started for the outside, and was caught
in a storm which it was not sufficiently strong to
weather. Only three or four men were to be left
aboard. That is the only explanation I could think
of.â

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âAs I said before,â he stated, âthat seems a reasonable
explanation. Three or four men, left alone,
might have feared to face the Winter iced in, or
might have been stricken ill, and so, for some reason
that appeared good enough to them, might have
decided to violate orders and start out. As to the

27

disappearance of the ship, many an undermanned
vessel has gone down in a storm, without leaving a
trace.â

âBut, Dad, youâve said nothing about this,â
protested Jack.

Mr. Hampton smiled slightly.

âThere are a lot of things which I know I have
never told you, Jack,â he said. âIf I really have
neglected to speak of this, however, it has been
through an oversight. Iâve had a lot of things on
my mind. But, come. We know this is the way
Thorwaldsson passed. We are on the right track.
So let us push on. We have still four hours of
travel to do before making camp.â

28
CHAPTER IV.âSTRIKING GOLD.

Life flowed along very pleasantly indeed, for the
boys, during the weeks that followed. They were
so far north that the sun shone constantly, and never
a cloud came to trouble the sky, never a storm to
drive them to take shelter. When they camped it
was usually in the dim cool recesses of a forest of
firs, beneath the dense shade of which could be found
the only semblance of night.

Never before had they known the delights of
camp life, as they were now living it. It was like
being on one continuous picnic. For a considerable
period of time they found themselves in a mesh or
network of streams and lakes, through which Tom
Farnum guided them steadily northeastward, with
never a sign of doubt as to the course to take.

They wondered about this, asked why they took
certain forks of river or stream, why avoided others.
Tom answered readily enough. From Mr. Anderson
he had received a minute report containing every

29

scrap of data Farrell had been able to furnish as to
the course taken by him and Cameron on going into
the wild country.

âSo you see,â he added, âwhile I may not be following
in the exact footsteps of Thorwaldsson, yet
I am going over the same general route. Sooner or
later we will cover the same ground which he covered
again, and then I expect we shall find some
other record which he has left behind, just as in the
case of that note on the Hare Indian.â

This was enough for the boys. It satisfied their
curiosity. They dismissed, or practically so, from
their minds all worry as to the âLost Expedition.â
They were too busy enjoying life as they found it
each waiting moment.

Around each bend in a stream that their paddles
took them, on the shore of each deep, silent lake,
was some new marvel. Now it would be a bear
grunting on the bank. Again, a deer, probably a
runaway from some Eskimo herd on Summer pasture
as Farnum explained, standing in the stream,
and starting with a snort into the timber at their
approach. Occasionally a gray wolf could be seen
loping in the distance. Now and again a beaver cut
across stream.

With their light rifles the boys occasionally were
permitted to pick off some game, usually wild ducks
or geese, of which there were numbers along the

30

watercourses. But nothing was shot wantonly.
Many a time, youthful fingers itched on the trigger,
only to be restrained by the thought of the cruel
uselessness of shooting merely for sport.

Of other inhabitants in this vast northern wilderness,
none were encountered. And at this the boys
marvelled. It was as if they had the world to themselves.
They could not understand it. To them it
was a paradise.

âWait till you see this in Winter,â said Farnum
grimly. âOr rather, pray that you never do. It is
a land of perpetual night, and the temperature is so
low that when you stop moving you must have a
fire or you will freeze to death. And it isnât every
day that you can travel. For this isnât a land of
tame Winter as you boys know it. Out of the north
comes storms succeeding storm, pitiless in severity.
Even the creatures of the wild cannot stand it, in
many cases, and drift to the south.â

âBut how about the Eskimo?â asked Jack. âThis
is their country, isnât it? How do they stand it?â

âSometimes they donât,â said Farnum. âWhen
the hunting is poor and famine stalks through the
Eskimo village, only the hardiest survive.â

âWhere do they live, anyway?â struck in Frank.
âWhy arenât they around here? Why havenât we seen
any?â

âThey may have seen us,â said Farnum, âand are

31

avoiding us. They are a timorous people, know the
white man only by tradition. To the Eskimo, the
white man is a sort of god, at least to the Eskimo
of all this country north of us. Back along the coast
of Alaska, of course, some sort of contact has been
made. But these Eskimo never come in touch with
the whites. They are a migratory people. In Summer
they range far and wide on the hunt. In the
Winter, they retire to the edge of the Arctic Ocean.â

âBut why?â asked Bob, in surprise. âI should
think that would be the very place for them to steer
away from.â

âOh, no,â said Farnum. âYou see, all game goes
far to the south in Winter, so the Eskimo goes to the
ocean because it is the home of the only game leftâthe
seal. He builds his snow house or igloo and
camps near the air holes of the seal, spearing them
as they come up for air. Occasionally he slays a
polar bear, too.â

âI confess I know very little about the Eskimo,â
said Jack. âWhat are his weapons?â

âBows and arrows tipped with flint or copper, copper-pointed
spears, and wooden knives edged with
copper,â said Farnum.

âBut, a bear,â cried Bob, incredulously. âHow
could an Eskimo kill a great polar bear with such
weapons?â

âSingle-handed, he couldnât,â said Farnum. âBut

32

when the bear is hunted, the whole tribe of hunters
go together. They attack in a circle. Their spears
or harpoons have lines attached. And as these harpoons
sink into the body of the bear, the lines pull
him this way and that as he charges on his tormenters.
Eventually, if the Eskimo are lucky, they
have him so surrounded that he cannot move. Then
one dashes in and administers the death blow.â

âThen necessity forces them to live in tribal
groups?â asked Jack.

Farnum nodded.

âIn the Summer they often hunt alone, ranging
far, for they are great travelers. But in Winter, the
hunters are all back with the tribe.â

âAnd the Indians?â asked Frank.

Farnumâs face darkened.

âThere are not many,â he said. âI wish there were
less. You may say all you please about the ânoble
red man.â But all I ever heard about the Indians
of the Far North doesnât predispose me in their
favor. They are cutthroats, thieves and liars. Usually
they hunt somewhat to the south of us, and make
their way in towards the northern Canadian settlements
as Winter approaches. Letâs hope we encounter
none of them.â

The boys wondered as they went along whether
this were gold-producing country into which they
were pushing. They spoke of the matter to Dick,

33

their canoe mate, at times. Taciturn though he was
usually, at every mention of gold his eyes brightened,
and he became almost voluble.

âNever been this far north,â he said on one occasion,
âno white man ever has been in here, reckon.
But Iâd like to stop at the foot oâ some of these rapids
and wash a little gravel for luck. I sure would like
to.â

âLetâs do it the next rapids we come to,â suggested
Frank, with eager interest. âIt wouldnât take
long, would it?â

âOrders is not to waste time.â

âWell, Iâll speak to father,â said Jack. âIâm sure
heâd let us try it just once.â

In this surmise he was correct, for the noon halt
happened to be at the foot of a rapids that would
necessitate a portage, and Dick and Art reported the
graveled bank showed signs of âcolor.â Even
Farnum, his mind concentrated on the task of
getting his party along and on the job in hand,
showed interest when addressed on the subject.
With pick and pan, therefore, the two men got busy,
while the boys watched with breathless interest the
process of rocking the pan and washing out the
gravel.

âWhoopee,â cried Dick, suddenly. âThar she is.
Color in the pan.â

34

âSure as Iâm born,â ejaculated his partner.
âStrong, too.â

All the boys could discern, however, were some
dully gleaming particles at the bottom of the pan,
out of which most of the gravel had been washed
with the water. They had half expected to spy
nuggets. Farnum and Mr. Hampton, however, were
as eagerly interested as the two old-timers.

âTry another pan, men,â suggested Mr. Hampton.
âLet us go a little farther upstream.â

Once more the process was repeated. This time
the pan was rich in âpayâ and the excitement of the
four older men mounted, hectic spots glowing dull
beneath their tan in the cheeks of the two old-timers
especially.

Then Dick, who was wielding the pick, attacked a
clump of rocks in the edge of the stream at the very
foot of the rapids, standing in his boots almost knee-deep
in the water. For several minutes he picked
and pried and finally, with a shout of delight, turned
to his audience behind him on the bank and, having
plunged an arm into the water, held it up dripping.

âLook,â was all he said.

They gazed, all eyes.

âWell! Well!â cried Art.

A small but sizable nugget lay on Dickâs outstretched
palm.

35

âWhat luck,â cried Jack. âYou certainly looked
in the right place.â

âBet thereâs more gold around here,â cried Frank.
âMaybe a bonanza. Who knows?â

âYou ought to stake a claim, Dick,â said big Bob.
âI donât know much about the process. But thatâs
the thing to do, isnât it?â

âHuh,â said Dick, generously. âBelongs to you
boys well as me. You thought of it.â

âOughter work it,â spoke up Art. âMight take
out a good poke this Summer.â

This remark recalled Tom Farnum to the object
of his expedition.

âNo, no, men,â he said, sharply. âDonât get
bitten with the gold fever now. Weâve got work
ahead of us, work that we contracted to do.â

âRight,â said Dick.

Artâs face fell, but he, too, nodded agreement.

âJust the same,â said Farnum, softening, âthereâs
nothing to prevent you two from staking a claim.
Some day you may come back to work it.â

âBelongs to us no moreân the rest oâ you,â said
Dick, sturdily. âThe young fellers wanted us to
make a try at it here just for luck, anâ we did.â

A warm debate followed, the boys protesting they
were not entitled to any part in the find. Finally
Dick capitulated.

âTell you what,â he said. âArt anâ meâll stake

36

this claim anâ file on it. But if we ever come back
to work her anâ she pays, weâll declare you in.â

âNot unless you let us help to finance the expedition,â
said Jack, turning for confirmation to his
comrades. âIsnât that right, fellows.â

Bob and Frank agreed. Farnum put an end to the
discussion.

âGood enough,â he said. âLet it go at that. Now
we must buckle into the job. Do you realize weâve
spent more than two hours here, when we should
have stopped only a half hour? Weâve got to make
this portage and push on. Come on. Everybody
to his task.â

37
CHAPTER V.âA SURPRISE THROUGH THE AIR

Joyously though time flew by for the boys, with
Mr. Hampton and Tom Farnum it was a different
matter. They were worried, that became increasingly
plain. Finally, although Mr. Hampton purposely
refrained from saying anything to disturb the
boys, Jack took note of his fatherâs perturbation and
questioned him about it.

âWell, Jack,â said his father, âweâve been weeks
on the trail. We canât proceed much farther, without
being compelled to start out. And yet so far we
have discovered no further trace of Thorwaldssonâs
party. When we entered the MacKenzie, which
flows north, we were going to the south. Going up
the Hare Indian we struck east. Since getting into
the streams, rivers and lakes we have been going
east. Shortly we shall strike the Coppermine,
Beyond that lies the river of oil, as reported by
Farrell.

âSo far we have made good time. With luck, we

38

shall be able to reach that territory before having to
turn back or, rather, for we shall not retrace our
steps, turn south. And we should have struck some
other trace of Thorwaldssonâs party long ere this, if
we are on the right track. However, you boys need
not worry about this, so letâs talk of something else.â

Seeing that his father had sunk into one of his
rare periods when he wished to be alone with his
meditations and did not welcome intrusion even from
Jack, the latter moved away to join his comrades.

âDadâs plainly worried,â he said. And he explained
the circumstances. âWish I could find
some way to make him forget his troubles,â he said.

âI know what,â said Frank. âHe loves music.
Weâre camping for the night. Althoughââwith a
look at the sunââthere isnât much night, is there?
Well, anyhow, itâs nighttime in Edmonton, where
that new broadcasting station was set up last Spring.
Letâs rig up our radio and see if we canât pick up
their concert, just for luck. What do you say?â

âI say, good,â declared Jack.

âEdmontonâs long way off,â objected Bob.

âThatâs nothing,â said Jack. âI believe we can
pick it up all right.â

âIn this northern country we have no static problem,
anyway,â said Frank. âWe couldnât send to
Edmonton with our equipment, but Iâll bet we can
catch.â

39

While Farnum and Mr. Hampton put their heads
together in low-whispered conversation, poring over
a map, and while Art and Dick lay outstretched
under some fir trees, already disposed for sleep, the
three boys quietly got out the necessary equipment
from among the luggage and set to work.

âA short distance up the stream,â said Frank, âI
saw two firs taller than most, standing alone.
Theyâre a pretty good distance apart, too. We can
climb up those trees and string the aerial between
them.â

They made their way to the trees noted by Frank,
and found them exactly suited to the purpose. Jack
and Frank, were lighter than Bob, took turns climbing
the trees, and the wires were strung without any
great difficulty. They worked busily, and when
everything was all connected up, Bob looked at his
watch.

âAllowing for the difference in time,â he said,
âtheyâre about ready to begin their concert. On
what meter wave length does the Edmonton station
send, Frank?â

âI donât recall. About three hundred and fifty, I
suppose. Weâll tune up and try, anyway.â

âWhat dubs we are, fellows, not to have thought
of this before,â said Jack.

âOh, well,â said Bob, âbroadcast concerts never
did interest me much, anyway. I like to do the sending

40

myself, weâve always been dog-tired when we
made camp at night, and ready to turn in as quickly
as Art and Dick. If it hadnât been for your thought
of bringing some relaxation and amusement to your
father tonight, Jack, weâd have been asleep already.â

âI guess thatâs right, old thing,â Jack replied.
âYou would have been asleep, anyway, even if the
rest of us kept tossing. But what does she say,
Frank? Any luck yet?â

Frank, who had been manipulating the controls,
looked up mirthfully.

âWhat do you think of your musical program,
Jack?â he replied. âListen in a minute will you?
Theyâre sending out a crop and weather report.â

Jackâs face fell, then he, too, laughed.

âOh, well,â he said, âthatâs just a preliminary.
The concert will follow.â

âNo,â answered Frank, who had resumed his
headpiece, ânow itâs a bulletin report on the dayâs
news events. Listen. Why, greatââ

His voice died. Over his face came an expression
of surprise.

Jack and Bob sprang to take up the other headpieces
attached to the box. Over their features also
spread amazement and even consternation. They
listened intently. Then all three simultaneously tore
off the receivers and looked at each other.

41

âWhew, what do you know about that?â said Bob,
in an awed tone.

âAnd on the very night that we decided to set up
the radio, too,â said Frank.

âIt seems like the hand of fate,â declared Jack.
âSay, we must get father and Tom Farnum.â

âThorwaldssonâs airship found wrecked on land
near the mouth of the MacKenzie,â said Bob. âAnd
the skeleton of the aviator. Can you beat it?â he
ejaculated again.

âHey, Jack, wait a minute,â cried Frank, running
after his companion, who already had started for
camp. âDiscovered by Indians who were bringing
out furs, did you get that?â

Jack nodded, but saved his breath as he continued
to run. Frank fell in beside him, Bob pounding at
his heels.

In a few moments they burst excitedly upon the
graveled beach by the river, where camp had been
made for the night. Dick and Art lay outstretched
in slumber under the nearest fir trees. Mr. Hampton
and Farnum were still deep in their discussion, and
apparently had not even been aware of the absence
of the boys, for they looked up in surprise as the
latter approached.

âWhat is it, Jack? Whatâs the matter?â demanded
Mr. Hampton, rising to his feet in alarm, as he
noted his sonâs excitement.

42

Quickly, Jack related what had occurred, describing
their setting up of the radio, their picking-up of
the Edmonton stationâs nightly program, and their
discovery that Thorwaldssonâs airship had been
found far behind them near the mouth of the MacKenzie.

âIt was only a bulletin news report, Dad,â Jack
explained, âyet I suppose it contains all the facts.
Evidently the discovery of the airship had been made
weeks ago by Indians, going to the mouth of the
MacKenzie with their Winter catch of furs. But,
of course, it took a long time for the news to reach
civilization. It was just made public today. The
very day, too, that we decided to rig up the radio.
It certainly seems like the hand of fate, doesnât it,
Dad? If we had waited until tomorrow, or set up
the radio yesterday, probably we would not have
known of this discovery.â

Mr. Hampton nodded, but absently. Already his
mind was busy with the problem.

âDid the report state any message or papers of
any sort were found on the body of the aviator?â

âNo. Only that the body had been there a long
time, as nothing but the skeleton remained.â

âAnd that was all?â

âThat was all the definite information,â said
Frank. âOf course, there was a word or two of
speculation as to what had occurred. The theory

43

was advanced that the aviator was flying to summon
aid for Thorwaldsson, who was in some predicament,
but that some accident occurred to his engine while
flying, and he fell to his death.â

âA plausible enough theory,â said Farnum. âBut,
in that case, I canât understand why the aviator did
not bear some message from Thorwaldsson. Can
you, Mr. Hampton?â

Mr. Hampton shook his head.

âThatâs not the only puzzling thing,â he said.
âThe disappearance from the MacKenzie of Thorwaldssonâs
ship, the death of the aviator, the lack of
message on his body, the swallowing up of Thorwaldsson
and his party, Thorwaldssonâs failure to
send any radio messagesâall these need explaining.

âWe must face the fact,â he continued, âthat some
disaster of a totally unexpected nature has befallen
Thorwaldssonâs expedition. And I mean by that a
disaster of manâs agency. They were prepared for
practically all eventualities in their grapple with
nature. Although the Winter was severe, yet they
were well provisioned, had Farrell who knew the
country, and were prepared in every way for a
lengthy stay. Even if worst came to worst, and
Winter proved too much for them, some would have
survived and brought out word of what had befallen.â

âThen you think, Dadââ

44

Jack regarded his father, wide-eyed.

âI think, Jack,â said the latter firmly, âthat it is
time to take you boys into our complete confidence,
Farnum and I have been talking this matter over.
We feel pretty certain that some powerful man or
group of men has knowledge of Farrellâs discovery
of the river of oil, and is working against us. How
to explain the obtaining of that knowledge I do not
know, But, perhaps, some traitor in Andersonâs
employ, somebody high in his confidence, got some
word of it. Perhaps, Thorwaldsson in an unguarded
moment, let some bit of information fall. Oil, you
know, is a vital necessity of the world. Discovery
of a vast new field would make great fortunes.

âWhoever heard of it, heard of Farrellâs discovery,
would realize that the only way to come upon
it would be to follow the Thorwaldsson expedition,
dog its steps and, at the psychological moment,
strike. In other words, when the field was rediscovered
by Farrell, wipe out the Thorwaldsson expedition,
and claim possession.

âEvents, as they have occurred, seem to fit in with
this theory. The disappearance of Thorwaldssonâs
ship from the MacKenzie. Apparently it traveled
only at night, thus slipping by the scattered trading
posts on the great river. It has never been heard of
since. It might very easily have been scuttled and
sunk, or else materially changed in appearance in

45

some little bay on that far northern coast of the
Arctic. That would mean that the crew was bought
up, but that is not an impossibility, for men I am
sorry to say break faith for gain. As to the airship,
the aviator whom I know of as a man true and tried,
may have sought to make his escape to the outside
when Thorwaldsson was capturedâas I believe
likelyâand may have paid with his life for his
devotion, through some unforeseen accident to his
machine.â

The boys stood stunned. Finally Jack broke
silence.

âBut, Dad, how terrible,â he said in a shocked
tone. âTo think of men being so unscrupulous.â

âNot all men, Jack,â said his father. âRemember
that.â

âMr. Hampton,â said Frank. âWhat do you intend
to do?â

âFrankly, I donât know,â said the latter. âNow
that we are within striking distance of our objectiveâthe
river of oilâI do not want to give up.
If it lies where we believe it to lie, we can reach it
before necessity compels us to flee south to escape
oncoming Winter. That will mean that we can map
the route for future operation. I had at one time,
too, although I did not mention it to you boys, some
hope that we would be able to follow the river out
into the Arctic and discover a route of approach by

46

water. But we may not have time for that. However,
once we do locate the river by land approach,
we will have a pretty accurate idea of whether it can
be reached by ship through the Arctic Ocean in
Summer.

âBut whether to push on and imperil you lads, and
the rest of us, in the light of what we suspect lies
ahead, I do not know. We shall have to sleep over
it.â

After some further conversation, all returned to
where the boys had rigged up the radio. Dick and
Art were childishly delighted at the concert, the first
in their experience. Farnum was almost equally
stirred. As to Mr. Hampton, for the time he forgot
his worries in enjoyment of the music. As showmen,
the boys were in the element.

More than an hour passed, and the concert was
still in progress, when Frank, who had been absent
unnoted suddenly approached from the thick forest
of firs on the bend, below which lay their camp, with
a face so pale that Jack, who first caught sight of
him, became alarmed.

âWhat is it, Frank?â he asked, seizing his comrade
by an arm.

For a moment Frank was speechless. He
swallowed convulsively, but was unable to make a
reply. The others looked at him in astonishment,

47

and all tore the headpieces off and neglected the closing
number of the concert, as they stared at him.

With outstretched arm, Frank pointed towards
the point of land, making a bend in the stream,
beyond which lay their camp.

48
CHAPTER VI.âINDIANS!

âIndians.â

That was all Frank said, but it was sufficient. Over
the faces of Mr. Hampton, Farnum and the two men,
Dick and Art, came looks of alarm.

âIn camp,â asked Jack, a sudden thought striking
him. âMaybe theyâre just visitors.â

But Farnum shook his head decisively, before
Frank could reply.

âThe only Indians in this country hate the white
man,â he said. âThey have had some cause, goodness
knows. But the point is, they hate us.â Turning
abruptly to Frank, he said:

âDo they know where we are? Were you seen?â

âI was approaching our camp from this side,â
said Frank, who had recovered his speech. âI was
in search of a handkerchief, for Iâve got a little cold,
and found I did not have one with me. Anyway,
my feet made no sound on the pine needles, and I
was screened from the camp by the trees. Suddenly,

49

as I neared the last fringe, I saw a dozen Indians
or more steal out of the trees on the other side of
the clearing. They fell upon our belongings and
started going through them. I hurried away to
warn you.â

âQuick,â said Farnum, âthere is no time to lose.
We are seven and all armed. They saw us depart
and probably thought this was a grand chance to
rifle our camp. Waited a while to see if we were
coming back at once. I imagine they are just
thieves. Well, weâll give them a lesson. Come on.â

Mr. Hampton laid a detaining hand on Farnumâs
arm.

âEven if they are thieves,â he said. âWe want
no bloodshed. Shoot over their heads, if shooting
is necessary.â

Farnumâs face fell.

âAll right, sir,â he said. âJust as you say. But
weâll have to hurry, or theyâll get away with everything
and escape in our canoes. Then we would be
out of luck, indeed.â

With beating hearts, the party stole back through
the trees, spread out with intervals of several yards
between each. Dick and Art, who never stirred
anywhere without their rifles with them, being old-timers
who knew what it meant to be separated
from their weapons in this wild land, were on the
ends of the line. The boys had left their rifles behind,

50

as had Mr. Hampton. Farnum, however, had
brought his, and held the middle position. The
other four were armed with their revolvers.

As they neared the fringe of trees forming the
last rampart between them and camp, crouching
behind tree trunks as they stole forward, they could
see a group of Indians still busy over their disordered
luggage, which had been opened and tossed
about near the fire. Another group was at the
waterâs edge, loading the canoes which had been
drawn up on the sand.

âJust in time,â thought Jack.

Then his eye was caught by a picturesque figure
of a man emerging from the little tent which Mr.
Hampton employed, because he was a sufferer from
rheumatism and wanted some shelter to keep off
night chills in case they were late in getting out of
the country, but which at present frequently was
not set up on their halts. The present occasion,
however, a whim to sleep under canvas rather than
the fir trees had possessed him, and the tent had
been set up.

The man who caught Jackâs attention differed
little in dress from Dick and Art, but about his
head was bound a red bandanna handkerchief in
piratical fashion, and this suggestion was increased
by his long, drooping black mustaches. Jack could
see him clearly, and thought that seldom had he

51

looked upon a more villainous countenance. The
fellow held a piece of paper in his hand, and was
reading it with evident satisfaction.

A low exclamation from Farnum, next in line on
his left, drew Jackâs attention. He looked at the
latter, crouching behind a tree. Farnumâs eyes were
ablaze. He had raised his rifle and was pointing it
at the man before the tent. The next moment there
was a report, the paper fell from the fellowâs hand,
and he emitted a howl of surprise and pain.

âJust the hand,â Jack overheard Farnum say in
a tone of vexation, as he prepared to fire again. But
the other, seizing his wounded hand in the unwounded
one, did not wait for the attack. Running
low and in zigzag fashion, he darted for the cover
of the trees on the other side of the camp, at the
same time shouting an unintelligible warning to his
companions.

âFire,â shrieked Farnum, pumping another shot
after the fleeing man, that kicked up the dirt at his
heels. âThatâs Lupo the Wolf. Shoot to kill.â

Jack shot with the rest, but remembering his
fatherâs exhortation fired high. The volley was
general. From the rifles of Art, Dick and Farnum
came deeper notes of heavy weapons, while from
the four revolvers of the others poured a succession
of shots. It sounded as if an army were opening
fire from the woods.

52

The Indians did not stay upon the order of their
going. Those grouped about the luggage ran after
the disappearing man Farnum had called Lupo the
Wolf, while the other group at the canoes dashed
away along the graveled bank of the stream. One,
however, sought to launch the canoes into the swift
current before departing, but his first effort was ineffectual,
and any further attempt was stopped by
a bullet from Mr. Hamptonâs revolver, which
winged him in an arm and sent him scurrying after
his fellows.

âDick, Art, here,â cried Farnum, peremptorily.

The two ran to his side.

âThat was Lupo the Wolf,â Farnum explained
rapidly, his voice betraying his excitement. âYou
can guess what that means?â

The others nodded, with compressed lips.

âI want you to trail them. Donât run into danger,
but see if their camp is nearby.â

With nods of understanding, the two frontiersmen
were off at the run, not crossing the open camp,
but circling it amongst the trees. Then Farnum
turned to Mr. Hampton, and the boys crowding at
his heels.

âThat wasnât just an attack from Indian thieves,â
he said. âMr. Hamptonââand his voice took on
a solemn toneââthat was a blow from the enemy.â

âWhat do you mean?â

53

âThey were desperadoes under the personal leadership
of Lupo the Wolf.â

âAnd he?â

âHe is a cross-breed, half Indian, half white, and
the most notorious bad man in the north. He is
known not only throughout the length and breadth
of Alaska, but throughout the Yukon of Canada,
too. From Ketchikan to Arctic City, and from
Nome to Dawson, he has gambled, fought, knifed,
murdered, and never been brought to book. Ah,
you consider Alaska is law-abiding these days. To
a certain extent, the towns and mining camps have
grown more orderly and there are sheriffs ânorth of
54.â But might still rules in the camps.â

Farnum spoke bitterly, and leaned a moment on
his rifle. As it was evident, however, that he had
not yet finished, the others did not interrupt.
Presently he resumed.

âLupo recruits his men from the fisheries. Men
of the lowest type come there in Summer, in droves,
lured by the high wages. They form temporary
alliances with the native women. Then in the Fall,
they depart. You can guess what the children of
such lawless unions are like. They are cross-breeds,
inheriting the most vicious and lawless characteristics
of the human race. It is from them Lupo
recruits his following.â

âBut why should they be away over here, in this

54

unpeopled wilderness?â asked Mr. Hampton. âUnlessââ
He paused and looked questioningly at
Farnum.

The latter nodded.

âThatâs it,â he said. âWhy? Unless, if you will
let me finish for you, Lupo is on our trail. And
that I believe to be the case. When Frank here first
came with word of Indians in camp, I considered
them merely raiders from some passing body of
hunters. But when I found Lupo at their head, I
knew better. The wonder to me is,â he said, growing
thoughtful, âthat he did not send men to trail
us and kill us or take us prisoner.â

Mr. Hampton shrugged.

âEven the cunningest slip up now and then,â he
said. âPerhaps his men wanted to loot first. And,
anyway, they had only been here a few moments
when, thanks to Frank, we were able to surprise
them. Well, thanks to our good angel, we came
off as well as we did. Nothing stolen, our canoes
still here, nobody hurt.â

âAh,â said Farnum, darkly, âweâre not out of the
woods yet. If Lupo the Wolf is after us, wellâthere
is trouble ahead.â

55
CHAPTER VII.âA MAN OF THE âMOUNTED.â

While Mr. Hampton and Farnum turned in to
take inventory to discover what, if anything, had
been stolen, the boys went back to take down and
pack their radio outfit. As it lay in the opposite
direction from that taken by the Indians who, moreover,
were being tracked by Dick and Art and could
not double back without warning being given, it was
considered safe for the boys.

When they returned to camp, they found the two
frontiersmen ahead of them. These reported the
Indian camp pitched some two miles in their rear
and that, upon arrival, Lupo and his men had
packed up and taken canoe on the back track.

âNow what does that mean?â asked Farnum,
thoughtfully. âIt is probable that Lupo has been
behind us all the way, if what I suspect is true,
namely that they have been trailing us. But why
should they be fleeing now?â

âThey canât have been close to us all the time,

56

Mr. Farnum,â said Bob, âor why werenât we attacked
before?â

Farnum nodded.

âThatâs true enough,â he said. âIt may be that
Lupo started late and has been all this time catching
up with us.â

Breaking a thoughtful silence, Mr. Hampton
said:

âAs a matter of fact, that seems the most probable
explanation. The other side, Farnum, probably has
a spy at Nome, of whom you are unaware. But the
spy knows your identity. Your story of taking us
into the wilderness to hunt may have deceived this
spy. But then, later, word would reach him from
Seattle of my identity. Not that it is commonly
known. But if some traitor close to Anderson is
trading on Farrellâs secret, my connection with
Anderson would be suspected, especially as several
years ago I worked with the Anderson oil crowd in
New Mexico. So words would reach Nome to
watch me. Then someone would start out on our
trail.â

âAnd that someone was Lupo,â said Farnum.
âA fine cutthroat.â

An earnest discussion followed. What did this
turning back of Lupo the Wolf mean? Did he intend
to stick to their trail, but at a greater distance
in the rear? Or did he plan to encircle them and

57

lie in ambush ahead? That his retreat was other
than momentary, and meant he intended giving up
their pursuit, nobody believed.

âLook here, Dad,â said Jack, during the course
of this discussion, âdonât you consider it quite likely
that Lupo intends to take us by surprise and attack
us, rather than to retreat?â

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âI do, indeed, Jack,â he said. âA cutthroat such
as Lupo would have brought his band of desperadoes
here for only one purpose, and that is, to
dispose of us. We were lucky this time by reason
of the fact that they came upon our camp first, and
stopped to loot. But from now on we shall have to
be continually on our guard.â

âItâs a good thing, Mr. Hampton, that this is the
long Summer, when daylight never fails,â said
Frank. âThat makes it easier to guard against a
surprise attack.â

âYes,â Mr. Hampton agreed, âthat makes it
easier. But from now on, we shall have to be on
the watch continually.â

He was silent a moment, thinking. Then he
turned to the other members of the party, Farnum,
Dick and Art being gathered about him as well as
the boys, preparatory to the launching of the
canoes, which were ready loaded.

âAre we making a mistake in letting these fellows

58

out of sight?â he asked. âWould it be better to set
Dick and Art to watch them, and appoint a rendezvous
where we can come together later?â

The two Alaskans were silent. Their faces, however,
showed approval of the plan. Farnum struck
his forehead with clenched fist in a characteristic
gesture.

âJust what I would have proposed myself, if I
had been awake,â he confessed. âDick, Art, do you
think you could pick up their trail?â

The two nodded.

âThey wonât back track far,â said Dick. âArt
anâ me can follow âem afoot. That last portage is
only four miles back, anâ we can catch up with âem
there. Now about where to meet up with you
again?â

âNone of us know this country,â said Farnum,
âand so it will be difficulty to appoint a rendezvous.
But, look here. Lupo undoubtedly intends to continue
our pursuit, and wonât let our trail go cold.
Consequently, you will be near us. I think the best
plan will be to report to us at every camp. One of
you can keep watch on Lupo while the other brings
in a report.â

âGood enough,â said Dick, the more loquacious
of the pair. âLook for us at tomorrowâs camp.â

Supplied with bacon and a little flour sufficient
for a meal or two, guns at the trail, the pair struck

59

swiftly on the back trail, disappeared among the
trees at the bend and were gone from sight.

âAll right, boys,â said Farnum. âLetâs get going.
Can you manage your canoe all right by yourselves?â

Mr. Hampton laughed.

âI think they can scrape along, Farnum,â he said.
âProbably weâll be asking one of them to help us
before long. Well, come on.â

Paddles dipped into the stream once more, the
canoes shot away, and, with Farnum leading to set
the course, the boys fell in behind. In the leading
canoe, as the two men settled down to the stroke a
low-voiced conversation began that lasted a long
time. What Mr. Hampton and Farnum were saying
could not be heard, for the gap between the two
canoes, though not great, was considerable. Moreover,
they spoke in low tones. But the boys sensed
an undercurrent of anxiety felt by both the older
men. As for themselves, however, they were not
worried. On the contrary, the excitement of finding
themselves trailed had brightened them wonderfully.

âOld expedition was getting too monotonous,
anyway,â said Bob presently.

âOh, I suppose youâll want to challenge the best
Indian wrestler now, wonât you?â said Jack, in a
tone of mock seriousness.

60

âYes, Bob, why didnât you go back with Dick and
Art and send in your challenge?â asked Frank, in
the same jollying manner. âYou know you havenât
been in a match with anybody for some time. Here
was your chance, and you went and let it slip away
from you. But, donât worry, perhaps the Indians
will return. Who knows? You may even have a
chance to exchange courtesies with no less a personage
than Lupo the Wolf himself.â

The big fellow grinned, but made no reply. And
so the two canoes swept on between the low banks
of the stream, one weighted with anxiety, the other
filled with light-heartedness. The boys were not
simpletons. They realized, indeed, that they were
in a precarious situation. They were deep in the far
northern wilderness. An enemy of superior numbers
dogged their heels. In all that vast country,
was none to whom they could look for help. But,
for all that, they saw no occasion to worry. It
was not the first time in which they found themselves
in a ticklish situation. They had come unscathed
out of other perils, even winning some
honor in the encounter. They would do the same
again. Thus they put the matter to themselves.

Hour after hour passed, during which period
they twice encountered slight rapids, up which they
waded with the canoes instead of portaging. All
were tiring rapidly, for not only was their number

61

reduced by the absence of Dick and Art, and the
work made correspondingly heavy, but in addition
they were traveling now on reserve strength, as
prior to making the last camp they already had
done a big dayâs work.

Farnum, however, pushed ahead until at the end
of four hours of travel they came to the shore of a
small lake. Here, in a secluded cove, convenient to
the stream on which they had been traveling, they
were about to make camp, when Frank approached
Mr. Hampton and Farnum and indicated an island
a half mile away.

âIsnât that smoke over there?â he asked, pointing.

Farnum stared, and in a moment his keen eyes
confirmed Frankâs observation. Mr. Hampton put
up the field glasses which he always carried strapped
to him, and also saw the smoke. But he saw something
moreâa skin kayak drawn up on the shore of
the island.

âHard to tell from that what sort of man is
camping out there,â said Farnum, when informed
of the kayak. âEverybody uses âem in this countryâIndian,
Eskimo, and the occasional prospector. That
smoke doesnât indicate a big fire. Must be only one
man, or maybe, two. Letâs investigate. If we decide
to make camp out there, well, that island would be
a good place and it would be hard to surprise us
there if we kept guard.â

62

Once more, paddles were plied, and the two
canoes cut diagonally across the waters of the lake
towards the island. As they approached, Farnum
raised his voice in a hail. A moment later an
answering shout came back. Then a figure stepped
from the trees to the little stretch of sand upon which
the kayak was drawn up and stood, watching their
approach, hand shading eyes against the glare of
the sun, head bare.

âGreat Godfreyâs ghost,â exclaimed Farnum in
a low voice, turning his head slightly to address
Mr. Hampton, âitâs a policeman.â

âWhat?â

âA member of the Northwestâof the Canadian
Mounted Police.â

âWhatâs he doing here?â

âI donât know. But weâll soon find out.â

âWelcome, strangers,â said the other, a tall
bronzed man, as they approached. âJust in time for
a snack.â

He advanced to the waterâs edge, and stood ready
to help. Farnumâs appraising eye took in the approach.
Shoal water and a sandy beach! He decided
to drive the canoe up on the sands. Shipping
his paddle, he leaped from the bow into the water,
as the forefoot of the canoe grated lightly. Relieved
of his weight, the canoe rose at the bow and sank at
the stern under Mr. Hampton. Seizing the bow,

63

Farnum ran it up on the beach, the uniformed man
lending a hand. A moment later, Jack, who was in
the bow of the boyâs canoe, repeated the maneuver.
The two craft were drawn up side by side.

âMacDonaldâs my name,â said the Canadian
simply.

âKnow Arkell of Dawson?â asked Farnum.

âKnow him well,â said the other. âOne oâ the
best on the Force.â

âFriend of mine,â said Farnum.

The two clasped hands warmly. Then Farnum
introduced Mr. Hampton and the boys. MacDonald
led the way to a sheltered spot among the
trees, where a fire burned.

âJust about to broil some fish,â he said. âLucky
thereâs plenty. Iâm crazy about fishing,â he continued,
âand when they bit here I pulled out morân
I could use. Was wonderinâ what to do with âem
when I heard your hail. Guess I donât need to
worry about that any longer.â

As he spoke he busied himself about preparations
for dinner, and soon an appetizing odor of frying
fish rose to assail the twitching nostrils of the hungry
boys.

âSuppose I get another pan and help, sir,â
proffered Bob.

His comrades laughed, for the big fellowâs appetite
was proverbial among them. MacDonald nodded with a

64

grin of understanding. Bob tore back to
the canoes, and soon returned with a pan in hand.
In a short time the fish were fried, and all hands fell
to right heartily.

âLong way off your beat, arenât you?â asked
Farnum, of MacDonald, as they ate.

The other nodded. Then he regarded them
sharply.

âSame to you,â he said. âFirst white men Iâve
seen in many days.â

Mr. Hampton read a challenge in the straight
blue eyes under the grizzled brows, and met it
promptly.

âYes, and Iâll tell you why we are here,â he said.
âI think our meeting with you was providential. If
you have been in this country long, you may have
heard something that will help us. At any rate,
hereâs our story.â

Whereupon, he proceeded to relate the reason for
their presence. He made a clean breast of it, keeping
back nothing, telling MacDonald of the alleged
oil discovery by Farrell and Cameron, Cameronâs
death, Farrellâs return as guide to Thorwaldssonâs
expedition, and their presence now in an attempt to
trace the missing men.

âSo thatâs that,â said MacDonald. âSo thatâs the
reason for Thorwaldssonâs âLost Expedition.â And
it was into this country he come! Well, well.â

65

In conclusion, Mr. Hampton told of their recent
adventure with Lupo the Wolf. MacDonald manifested
keen interest. His hand, as he poured
tobacco into a pipe, shook slightly, and he spilled a
little of the precious tobacco.

âYou ainât heard of it likely,â he said. âYou
wouldnât. But this Lupo killed my partner on the
Force, anâ I asked the Inspector to let me go after
him myself. I followed him in from Dawson anâ
lost his trail several days ago. Now, wellââ

MacDonald averted his face, rose and walked
down towards the lake shore, and the others
respected his evident desire to be alone and did not
follow.

âOut after Lupo single-handed,â whispered
Frank. âAnd the desperado surrounded by all his
men, too.â

Farnum nodded.

âThat means nothing to the Mounted,â said he.

66
CHAPTER VIII.âFIRST BLOOD.

So tired were all members of the party after their
unexpected exertions of moving camp and trekking
on, coming at the end of a day filled with fatiguing
labor, that now a haven had been reached and they
had relaxed from their tension, they were ready to
go to sleep at once. First, however, preparations
had to be made not only to keep guard but to keep
watch also for Dick and Art. Although the latter
did not know definitely, of course, where they were
encamped, yet it would not be difficult for them to
follow the trail at least to the shore of the lake.

âLook here,â said MacDonald, returning to join
the conference, âIâm not near as tired as the rest of
you. Iâll keep watch for your friends for a couple
of hours while the rest of you get some sleep.â

âAll right,â said Farnum, gratefully, âthat is, if
you promise to wake me at the end of two hours.
I can use a little sleep right now.â

âTurn in, then,â said MacDonald. âThese

67

spruces give you enough shade. And, anyway, I
guess you donât need much inducement to go to
sleep.â

âI could sleep right out in the open sun with my
face turned up to the sky,â said big Bob, yawning.
âWell, nighty night, folks.â

Nothing occurred during MacDonaldâs watch,
and at the end of the two-hour period he awakened
Farnum, in keeping with the agreement.

âThought some of letting you sleep on,â he said.
âBut, to tell you the truth, I been travelinâ hard myself,
and need a little sleep, too.â

âRight,â said Farnum. âIâd have been peeved if
you hadnât waked me.â

Several hours later, Farnum keeping lonely vigil
among the bushes by the lake shore, descried a
canoe shoot out of the mouth of the stream down
which they, too, had come and swing into the lake.
At first, as only the bow of the canoe appeared, he
was startled, believing Lupoâs Indians already were
on the trail. But a moment later, with relief and
yet surprise to see them there, he made out the two
figures in the boat as those of Dick and Art.

The pair rested on their paddles a moment,
scanning the shore and also, Farnum noted, apparently
casting anxious glances behind them. He
was too far away, however, to see whether that
were really the case. Farnum realized that, with

68

the skin kayak belonging to MacDonald now drawn
safely out of sight among the bushes, beside their
own canoes, Dick and Art would not have the same
indications pointing to the island that had he on
arrival. Therefore, he stepped from the bushes and
was just about to set his cupped hand to his mouth
and call when the unexpected occurred.

Dick and Art already had dipped their paddles
into the water again and were making a wide swing
with the evident intention of bringing the canoe
parallel to the shore but some distance out, when
Farnumâs startled eyes beheld another canoe arrive
at the mouth of the stream behind them.

Action was as quick as thought. Dick and Art
evidently had managed to obtain one of Lupoâs
canoes and were being closely pursued. How closely,
moreover, apparently they did not know. He must
warn them, not only of his presence and of help
close at hand, but also of the danger behind them.
The course they were taking would bear them away
from the island and, unless changed at once, would
make it possible for Lupo to cut them off from their
friends.

Although he had left his rifle at camp, as he
stumbled out with sleep filling his eyes and dulling
his brain, Farnum had his automatic swinging in
the holster at his belt. Whipping it out, he shot
three times in rapid succession.

69

At the sound, Dick and Art stared towards the
island where Farnum, stepping into the open, was
vigorously waving his hat to attract their attention.
Lupoâs men also set up a shout, as they churned the
water racing to cut off their quarry.

âWhat is it?â cried Frank, first of the aroused
camp to gain Farnumâs side.

Then his glance took in the situation.

âLook here, those fellows might pick off Art
and Dick before they can gain safety, even if they
donât succeed in cutting them off,â he said. âLetâs
get our rifles, fellows, and open fire. A long shot,
but theyâre coming closer.â

âAnyway, it will make them draw in their horns,â
said Farnum. âTell you what, you boys run and
get the rifles, and Mr. Hampton and I will launch
one of our canoes. Weâll go out to help Dick and
Art, if those fellows keep closing in on them.â

The three boys sped away, nothing loath, but
when they returned they found Farnumâs plan unnecessary.
As the two canoes had swept along,
Dick, who was in the stern, suddenly had thrown
down his paddle, and taken up his rifle, while Art
had swung the canoe about with one dexterous
stroke. Dick immediately had opened fire, and Art
had followed suit.

The boys heard the shots as they ran down towards
the shore. When they reached the sand

70

they found Lupoâs men already had faced about and
were hurrying towards the mainland. One of their
number evidently was hit.

âMain good shootinâ at long range aâ so quick
after paddlinâ,â commented MacDonald appreciatively.

Content with having beaten off their enemies, the
two desisted, resumed their paddles and soon were
within hailing distance. Greetings and congratulations
were exchanged, and Dick and Art ran their
canoe on shore. As soon as the first hubbub of
exclamations died away, Mr. Hampton led the way
to the camp. MacDonald put the coffee pot on the
fire and between draughts of the strong, hot liquid
Dick told their story.

After leaving the previous camp, they had gone
back to where they seen Lupo break camp and start
on the back trail. The meaning of this move, they
had discussed. It seemed to them folly to believe
Lupo was relinquishing the chase. They believed
he would suspect Mr. Hampton and Farnum would
spy on him, and was merely trying to throw them
off guard by creating the impression that he was
abandoning the chase. Therefore, they had gone
warily, convinced that at the end of a short withdrawal
Lupo would call a halt and prepare to âbout
face.

This suspicion proved correct. Some two miles

71

farther on they discerned the four canoes of the
half-breed halted alongshore while Lupo harangued
their occupants.

âWe wanted to listen powerful bad to what he
was a-sayinâ,â explained Dick. âBut we couldnât
get close enough. There wasnât much cover near
âem and we had to lay hid where the trees was thickest,
quite a ways off. Art and I lay there, a-straininâ
our ears but without any luck when suddenly somethinâ
happens. Most of âem was on shore, listeninâ
to Lupo but in one canoe was one man a-huntinâ
around like heâd lost somethinâ.

âWhat it was we never did know. But suddenly,
this fellow shoves off with a shout to Lupo. Lupo
answers like he was agreeinâ. So then this fellow
comes a-paddlinâ down stream like mad. As he
goes by where weâre a-layinâ low, Art whispers to
me: âThis is where Lupo turns his gang around.
Thatâs sure. Best thing we can do is to beat it
back anâ warn our crowd. Anâ my legs is tired.
Iâd like to let my arms work for me. Letâs go.â

âI nods, and without any more words we backed
out and started down stream after that canoe. The
fellow is goinâ like mad, which means he ainât intendinâ
to go far. Heâs lost somethinâ or other and
thinks it may be floatinâ on the water or, maybe is
layinâ on shore where he touched. Anyway, thatâs
what we thought. We never did get to know. For

72

after weâd made a bend in the stream and put some
distance between Lupo and us, we decided it was
no use runninâ any farther.

ââHere goes,â said Art. And he let fly over the
Indianâs head. That fellow didnât wait for more.
He just jumped out of the canoe anâ started
swimminâ for the other shore. So then Art give me
his rifle anâ he swims out and brings in the canoe.
Last we seen of that Indian he was streaking it back
on the other bank. I got in andâwell, here we are.â

MacDonald, who had listened in silence, suddenly
interrupted:

âHow many men has Lupo got with him?â

âA dozen.â

MacDonald looked at Mr. Hampton.

âYou know why I want him,â he said. âFor
murder. And then thereâs this raid on you. There
are eight of us, includinâ these husky young fellows
of yours. Will you help me capture him anâ his
gang?â

Mr. Hampton looked thoughtful.

âBut, MacDonald, what would you do with them?
We canât turn aside from our own object long? We
couldnât help you guard them. And you couldnât
get twelve or thirteen men back to your Post single-handed,
especially if any of them are wounded.â

MacDonaldâs face fell.

âGuess youâre right,â he said. âBut when I think

73

oâ that skunkâmurderinâ the best pal a man ever
hadâwell, I see red, thatâs all.â His head sank to
his clenched hands and he sat on a fallen tree, staring
moodily at the ground between his feet.

âCertainly is a problem, Mr. Hampton,â said
Farnum, slowly. âIf we donât do something, Lupo
will continue to hang to our trail as we proceed, a
constant danger.â

âI know,â said Mr. Hampton. âLet me think.â

He, too, sat silent, staring meditatively at the
ground.

The boys had been listening with interest. Now
Frank nudged Jack, with whom he was standing by
the fire, and whispered in his ear. Jackâs face
brightened and he nodded.

âIâll bet they have,â he whispered. âAsk MacDonald.â

Frank turned to the ranger.

âMr. MacDonald, how far away is your Post?â
he inquired.

MacDonald looked up puzzled, but answered
readily enough.

âA good four hundred miles to the South.â

âWhy do you ask, Frank?â Mr. Hampton wanted
to know.

âJust a minute, sir, please,â begged Frank, once
more turning to MacDonald. âAnd how many men
are at the Post?â

74

âCaptain and five men.â

âOh, is that all?â

Frankâs tone was one of disappointment. MacDonald
smiled slightly.

âPeople think the âMountiesâ must be as many as
an army,â he said. âWell, we keep this wilderness
clean with a handful. Oâ course, when necessary,
too, we can swear in deputies.â

âHave you got wireless at the Post?â asked
Frank.

MacDonald nodded.

âCaptain equipped us some time back,â he said.
âAll posts or forts, as we call them sometimes, have
wireless now.â

âGood for you, Frank. I see what youâre driving
at now,â said Mr. Hampton. âYouââ

Frank nodded.

âYes, sir. I thought if we helped Mr. MacDonald
capture Lupo and his gang, we could call
his Post by wireless and have them send men to help
him take his prisoners in.â

75
CHAPTER IX.âA CALL TO THE FORT.

âNow,â said Jack, âis the time that I wish I had
my 20-kilowatt radio tube that I have been working
on so long.â

Mr. Hampton, Bob and Frank nodded sympathetically.
An enthusiast on radio, Jack had
developed a number of new appliances. The latest
of these was not yet completed. He had worked on
it in the laboratories at Yale during the Winter and
Spring. The lateness of his return to his classes,
however, inasmuch as he did not arrive at college
until after Christmas, due to the delay occasioned
by his adventures in South America in search of
âThe Enchanted City of the Incas,â compelled him
to devote most his time to catching up in his studies.
He did not, therefore, have as much time to devote
to laboratory experiments as he desired. As a consequence,
the 20-kilowatt tube had not yet been perfected,
when time came for him to depart for
Alaska with his father.

76

Jackâs 20-kilowatt tube, when completed, would
be the most powerful in the world, and he expected,
moreover, to construct others of greater kilo-wattage.
A 75-kilowatt tube had been produced in England,
it is true, but it had not been found practicable.
Jackâs tube was to be steel-jacketed and equipped
with a water-cooling device, due to the heat produced
when in operation. His big dream was that
this tube, when used as an amplifier in conjunction
with an alternator, would make trans-atlantic telephonic
communication as common as cabling or
wireless telegraphing.

âIf I only had one of my 20-kilowatt tubes now,â
he mourned, âwe would be able to talk not only with
Mr. MacDonaldâs Post but with Dawson or even
Nome.â

âWell, Jack,â said Frank, âitâs too bad. Just the
same, letâs get busy. For, with our 50-watt oscillator
tube set we will be able to communicate by
telegraph up to 500 miles. And, as the Post is only
400 miles away, we can reach it easily.â

For sending up to 500 miles, the boys knew they
could use either three or four 5-watt oscillator tubes
in parallel, or one 50-watt oscillator tube. They had
decided on the latter method, in making their preparations
for departure in faraway Seattle. For one
thing, and the biggest, transportation was the most
important item. And the 50-watt tube set was the

77

more compact. Quickly, then, with Mr. Hampton
helping, they got out the various parts from their
baggage and made the connections.

Farnum, the Northwest policeman, MacDonald,
and Dick and Art, watched with puzzled interest
and even awe as the four, working in unison, put
together the aerial series condenser, the blocking
condenser, the grid condenser, the telegraph key,
the chopper, the choke coil in the key circuit, the
filament volt-meter, the protective condenser in the
power circuit, the storage battery and the motor
generator.

Farnum and MacDonald asked questions, although
Dick and Art were content to sit silent
and watch, keen-eyed, as the construction work
progressed. Several times, too, Dick arose and
went to the waterâs edge to keep watch against surprise.
That any would be attempted for the time
being, nobody believed, as they figured the enemy
would consider them on guard.

As they worked, Jack explained for the benefit of
the others. His description of how the low voltage
current from the storage battery flowed into one of
the windings of the generator and drives it as a
motor thus generating higher voltage in the other
winding both puzzled and interested them. By the
time, the set was ready for use, Farnum, who was
something of a mechanic by inclination, had a fair

78

understanding of the set, but MacDonald, though
interested, was bewildered.

âIâm fair beat,â he confessed. âAnyhow, just so
you boys can make it work!â

âOh, weâll make it work, all right,â Frank assured
him. âWell, now, to try to call the Post. Whatâs its
call, Mr. MacDonald?â

âI happen to remember,â said MacDonald. âWe
were all so interested when wireless was put in that
Captain Jameson gave us a little lecture on it. He
said our call would be JSN, abbreviation for his
name. We were to remember it, in case of need,
when we were able to get to a wireless station.
Well, this is a case of need.â

âIâll say it is,â said big Bob. âWell, come on,
fellows, whoâs going to call?â

It was an honor or distinction that each was eager
to have, yet each wanted to force it on the others.
A friendly argument developed, to which Mr.
Hampton, smiling, put an end.

âLook here, boys, we are wasting time. Suppose
you draw straws for the privilege. You all know
the Morse and Continental codes, so there is no
question of ability involved. Hereââ breaking
three matchsticks into varying lengths and offering
themââtake your choice. Longest wins.â

Frank drew the winning stick. The others
laughed, clapped him on the back, and without

79

more ado he began pressing the key and sending
out the signal.

âIs somebody on duty at the Post wireless
station, do you think, MacDonald?â asked Mr.
Hampton.

âSomebody there all the time,â the latter replied.
âCaptain Jameson has found wireless so useful in
policing his vast district that he wonders how he
ever got along without it.â

âHurray,â shouted Frank, âlisten. Theyâre
answering.â

To those who understood the code, the answer
was plain:

âJSN answering. Who are you?â

âMacDonald,â tapped off Frank, grinning mischievously.

The receptor sounded almost angry.

âQuit your kidding.â

âNo, I mean it,â replied Frank. âThis is MacDonald
of the Mounted.â

âProve it.â

âThatâll stump old Frank,â chuckled Bob, in an
aside. But he was mistaken.

âAll right,â replied Frank, confidently. âDo you
know what my assignment is?â

âYes,â answered JSN, impudently. âDo you?â

80

âIâm after Lupo the Wolf,â tapped Frank. âNow
call Captain Jameson.â

âYouâre not MacDonald,â replied JSN, âbecause
he doesnât know the code. But you must be speaking
for him, for thatâs right about his assignment.
Iâll call Captain Jameson. You wait.â

âAll right,â tapped Frank.

Then he turned to the eager MacDonald, who
was itching to inquire what was occurring, but had
restrained himself until he should be appealed to by
Frank, in order not to interrupt. Like all men
unfamiliar with telegraphy, whether wireless or by
wire, he stood in awe of an operator, and believed
it would be terrible, indeed, to interrupt that superior
being. Frank took pity now on his curiosity, as
well as on that of Farnum, Dick and Art, crowding
behind him, and explained what had happened.

âAnd you actually got the Post?â asked MacDonald,
doubt in his voice.

Frank nodded.

âMy God,â said the big policeman. âThink of
the weeks I spent toiling up here, and now you
come along and talk across that distance without
the loss of a minuteâs time. Wonderful, well I
reckon.â

âWhen Captain Jameson arrives,â said Frank,
smiling, âI want you to stand close and Iâll translate

81

what he says, and you help me with the replies,
will you?â

âWonât I be interrupting you?â

âOh, no,â smiled Frank. âYou just come close
and wait until I speak. Itâll be all right. Wellââas
the receptor began to clickââI guess this is
Captain Jameson now. Yes,â with a nod, âitâs he,
all right. Heâs asking where you are, Mr. MacDonald.â

âTell him Iâm four hundred miles away and
close on Lupo. Tell him about yourselves and the
fight, and that weâre going to round up Lupoâs
gang and ask him how soon he can send men to
help me out with any prisoners we take, and if he
can send any at all, andââ

âOne minute,â said Frank. âI understand. Just
wait a bit now, while I telegraph.â

To explain at length the details of that telegraphic
conversation is unnecessary. Suffice it to say, that
the situation was fully explained to Captain Jameson,
and that the latter agreed to start a half dozen
deputies under a Sergeant to MacDonaldâs aid, as
soon as he should hear again as to the outcome of
the expedition against Lupo.

âItâll take a while for the men to reach MacDonald,â
said Captain Jameson. âBut with game
plentiful and the season open, he can camp until

82

they arrive, and thus keep watch over his prisoners,
providing he makes any. You people go ahead with
your rounding up of Lupoâs gang, and then let me
hear from you again.â

On that agreement, Frank finally closed the conversation,
as there was nothing further to be said.

83
CHAPTER X.âTHE BOYS LEFT BEHIND.

âMacDonald, Iâll agree to help you round up
Lupo and his gang,â said Mr. Hampton.

They were all sitting in conference, so to speak,
about the camp fire, over which Dick was busy
broiling fish which he and Art and the boys had
just pulled out of the lake. The appetizing odor
made the nostrils of the three hungry boys twitch
with anticipatory delight.

âFine,â said the big ranger, âthatâs the way I
like to hear you talk.â

âYes,â said Mr. Hampton, meditatively, âIâve got
a very good reason why we should cast in our lot
and help you, even supposing Lupo flees and draws
us off our course.â

âWhatâs that?â

âWell, itâs an easy enough one to guess. Lupo
evidently is after us. That means that he is being
paid by somebody to do us in, or at least thwart us
in our search. I want to know who that somebody

84

is. And the only way to find out is to make Lupo
prisoner and question him. Moreover, it is possible
we may be able to learn something about the mysterious
fate of Thorwaldsson and his expedition.â

Farnum had been listening closely. He nodded
with satisfaction.

âJust what I was thinking myself.â

âYouâre right, Mr. Hampton,â said MacDonald.
âBut such being the case, weâll have to be mighty
careful that Lupo doesnât get shot, as then your
prospective source of information would vanish.â

âTrue enough, MacDonald,â said Mr. Hampton.
âWeâll all have to be on guard against that misfortune,
for misfortune it would be.â

He raised his voice, calling the boys and Dick
and Art to him. Then he explained how matters
stood.

âAs soon as we finish breakfast,â he said, âweâll
start, and you must all be very careful not to shoot
Lupo, if it comes to a battle.â

As they ate breakfast, Bob who seldom spoke
but always to the point, raised a question which had
been puzzling him.

âMr. Hampton, what will we do with all our outfit?â
he asked. âAnd with our radio transmitter,
especially? Shall we dismount it? Must we take all
our outfit along?â

âIt would be too bad to dismount the radio, after

85

our trouble in getting it erected,â said Mr. Hampton.
âAnd to take all our outfit with us would be
to hamper our movements. On the other hand, we
canât very well leave everything here, for some of
Lupoâs men might slip away from the main body,
in fact, they may already have done so, and they
would put us in a terrible plight if they raided the
camp, in our absence.â

There was silence for a minute or two, then MacDonald
spoke.

âWe can certainly travel faster without your outfit
to hold us back,â he said, âespecially if Lupo
tries to run away. For then we could gain on him
at the portages, by traveling light. Look here, Mr.
Hampton, this island is easily defended. Weâve
been going to the shore to keep watch on the mainland
against surprise. But just a little ways
through the trees is a little rise, a knoll, from which
you can see the waters all around the island. One
man alone could keep guard here.â

âBut one man couldnât keep off an attack in
numbers,â objected Mr. Hampton.

âI donât know,â said MacDonald. âWith them
high-powered rifles of yours, it might be done.
They carry far, farther than any guns Lupoâs
Indians and breeds will have. Anyway, two men
certainly could manage to hold this place against all
comers.â

86

âAnd three,â added Farnum, with a significant
look at Mr. Hampton, âcould do it even better.â

The boys again were at the fire some distance
away, helping Dick broil more fish. Mr. Hampton
looked at them. He understood the significance in
Farnumâs tone.

âYou donât think they would be in danger here?â

âLess than they would be in with us, Mr. Hampton,â
said Farnum, lowering his voice as the other
had done.

Mr. Hampton considered. The proposal hinted
by Farnum, namely, that the boys should be left at
camp, tempted him. It was most assuredly true
that they would be in far less danger than if they
accompanied him against Lupo. And that appealed
to him, appealed powerfully. He was grateful to
Farnum in his thoughts for his solicitude for the
boysâ welfare.

On the other hand, he knew them for resourceful
in an emergency, and good fighters. And since the
idea that information might be obtained from
Lupo had come to him it had taken firm possession
of his thoughts. Lupo must be captured. Would
it not be folly to weaken their force by leaving
three young huskies, each of whom, moreover, was
a fine rifle shot, behind?

Besides, what would the boys say? If necessary,
he could command and they would obey. But Mr.

87

Hampton was not one to exercise his authority
dictatorially.

âI confess I donât know what to do, Farnum,â he
said finally.

At that moment, a laughing hail from the boys
announced the completion of the second batch of
food, and their imminent return.

âMake it a post of honor and danger,â whispered
Farnum, urgently. âTell them the radio must be
guarded, and the outfit, and that if we take these
things along our movements will be so hampered
that Lupo might escape. Tell them there is a big
possibility, too, that some of Lupoâs gang may attempt
to raid the camp while we are absent.â

The boys were so close at hand that Farnum
desisted. Mr. Hampton nodded. As they ate, he
broached the subject of leaving a guard in camp.

âThree of us ought to stay behind,â he added.
âThat will give sufficient protection for each other,
and provide a sure safeguard against surprise. Also,
that leaves five of us to go after Lupo. Four of
us can go in that bigger of our canoes easily, without
any baggage. It carried three of us, with baggage,
so far, MacDonald can go in his kayak. So
we can hit a fast pace, and make speed at the
portages, if any are necessary.â

âWho do you intend to leave behind, Dad?â
asked Jack quietly.

88

Mr. Hampton realized from his sonâs tone that
Jack understood his thoughts.

âWell, you three boys would be the natural ones
to be selected,â he said.

âOh, I say,â protested Bob.

âThatâs not fair, Mr. Hampton,â cried Frank.

Jack was silent. He knew his father. Close
association of the motherless boy with the older
man since boyhood had attuned their minds. He
understood how troubled his father was over the
possibility of running them into danger. And he
decided he would not add to his difficulties, but
would keep quiet, although inwardly he felt dismayed
at the prospect of âmissing the fun.â

âYou see how it is, fellows,â said Mr. Hampton,
and he proceeded to elaborate on the theme furnished
him by Farnum. âItâs a post of honor and danger
combined.â

Bob and Frank, however, were not convinced.
They started anew to protest But Jack silenced
them.

âAll right, fellows, letâs be sports,â he said. âIf
the older heads decide they donât need us, we wonât
force ourselves on them.â

âBut, Jack,â cried Bob and Frank in chorus.

âNo, I mean it, fellows,â said Jack. âCome over
here with me, and Iâll tell you something.â

Drawing them out of earshot, he added:

89

âDonât let us make it hard for Dad. Heâs got
troubles enough. Heâll feel a lot easier if we arenât
along. I know how you feel. I feel the same way
about it. But letâs make it as easy for Dad as we
can. Besides, there is something in what he said,
after all. There is no guarantee that some of Lupoâs
men wonât attempt to raid us. For my part, I believe
some of them must be watching this island
right now, and the minute they see the others safely
out of sight, theyâll attack us. For they know our
numbers, and they will realize the three of us are
here alone.â

âAll right,â grumbled Bob. âHave it your own
way, letâs get some more to eat. I havenât filled up
yet.â

âThis outdoor life makes me ravenous, too,â
agreed Frank. âAnd I used to be such a dainty
eater. Why, I just pecked at my food.â

âYou mean you ate food by the peck,â said Bob.
âFor a little guy, youâre the heftiest eater I ever
saw.â

âLittle guy, is it?â cried Frank. âI like that.â

And without more ado, he made a flying tackle,
his arms locking about Bobâs knees. The big fellow
came down in the brush and Frank piled on top
of him with a shout of glee.

âCome on, Jack. We havenât had a good rough-house
for a long time.â

90

Grinning, Jack joined in, and the three went
rolling and threshing about the bushes like a trio
of young bears.

At the fireside, Mr. Hamptonâs worried look relaxed,
and he grinned with enjoyment.

âItâs all right, now,â he said contentedly. âTheyâll
take their disappointment out in a grand wrestling
jamboree. Well, letâs pack up a little grub and get
ready to go.â

91
CHAPTER XI.âBOB FALLS ASLEEP.

In no time at all, Mr. Hampton and his party
were ready to set out. Of one thing they were
reminded by Jack, the individual radio sets constructed
along his own lines, the instrument of which
was so small and compact it was contained in the
panel of a ring.

âOnly trouble with these,â Jack said, âis that you
can receive but canât transmit. Howeverââ

âHowever,â his father interrupted, âthat is all
that will be necessary.â

âWhy?â asked Farnum.

âIt is hardly likely that the five of us will get into
such a predicament that we shall fail to return,â
explained Mr. Hampton. âBut the boys may be
attacked when we are gone, and may be placed in a
bad position. Then they can call for us.â

âAt least we could send out a hurry up call over
those sets,â said Jack. âAs for your calling us, well,
that will be a little more complicated, Dad, but it

92

can be done, if necessary. I insist on your taking
that army field set. It came in mighty handy in
South America. It is no great job to set it up.
And it weighs little. You are taking no other equipment,
and you can afford to take it along. It wonât
be in your way. Here it is, you see, all boxed up
complete, handle on the box and everything.â

âRight, Jack,â said his father. âNow we can
communicate with each other easily enough.
Wellââlooking about himââare we ready?â

The others nodded.

âThen,â Mr. Hampton said, âI propose that we
bring our canoes back through the trees, cross the
island and make for the mainland on the other side.â

Farnum and MacDonald nodded agreement.

âThis island is pretty long,â said MacDonald,
âand it will screen our departure on the other side,
in all likelihood. It is hardly likely, as a matter of
fact, that we will be seen, for Lupoâs party has not
shown itself since we beat off that canoe, and
probably is somewhere back up that stream out of
which your party came.â

âYou think they cannot see the mainland on the
other side of this island from there, Dad?â

âI donât believe so,â said Mr. Hampton.

âEven if they do catch a glimpse of us,â suggested
Farnum, âisnât it probable theyâll believe we
are pushing on? As a matter of fact, however, weâll

93

land on the mainland, and carry our canoes inland
and then up along the lake till we are out of sight,
when we can cross again, I suppose thatâs your idea,
Mr. Hampton?â

âMy idea exactly,â answered the other. âWell,
letâs get the canoe and MacDonaldâs kayak. They
have been pulled well up into the bushes, and we
can bring them across the island without detection
easily enough.â

âWait a minute, Dad,â said Jack, laying a detaining
hand on his arm. âIf they do see you crossing
the channel to the mainland, on the other side of
the island, theyâll know the whole party isnât along,
and will realize you arenât leaving, but merely carrying
out some maneuver.â

âMaybe, thatâs what they will think, Jack. On
the other hand, they might figure some of the canoes
got across beforehand. Anyway, leaving by the
back door, so to speak, is our wisest plan, I am sure.
The channel to the mainland on the other side is only
a narrow one, and the probabilities of our escaping
detection are all in our favor.â

The largest of the canoes, together with MacDonaldâs
kayak were dragged back through the underbrush
and carried across the island to be launched
on the other side. Nor did Jack neglect to load the
compact field transmitting set in the canoe, as the
party pushed off. Then, amid farewells from both

94

sides, Mr. Hampton and his party set out for the
mainland.

Jack watched the canoe and the kayak depart, with
something of a sinking of the heart. The same
feeling, he suspected, possessed his father. Neither,
however, presented other than a brave and cheerful
front. As for Bob and Frank, they had gotten over
their disappointment at not being permitted to accompany
the expedition, to a certain extent, and,
cast for the first time since the start of the trip, on
their own resources were beginning to enjoy the
situation.

âFirst thing, fellows,â said Frank, as the party
reached the mainland, hauled up canoe and kayak
and struck into the trees, âfirst thing is to go to this
knoll about which MacDonald spoke, and take a
view of the field.â

âYes,â said big Bob, âthen letâs divide up into
watches, so that the pair of us not drawn for the first
watch can get some rest.â

âYou certainly were born in the Land oâ Nod,
Bob,â scoffed Frank.

âYes,â said Jack, grinning, âif youâre as sleepy as
all that, weâll count you out right away. Frank and
I will draw for the first watch, and you can hit the
hay.â

âNot so fast,â said Bob. âIâll take my chance
with the rest of you.â

95

Meantime, they had been mounting the tree-covered
hill to which MacDonald had referred and
now, reaching the top, found that, despite its low
elevation, it was still so much higher than the rest
of the island and than the shores of the lake as well,
that they commanded a sweeping view not only of
the nearer shore to which Mr. Hampton had gone
but also of the farther one whence they had come.

Not a sign of human occupation, however, was
anywhere apparent. Eastward, although they
knew Mr. Hampton and his companions could not
have progressed far, yet the trees rimming the lake
shore were sufficiently dense to hide any sign of
movement. Westward, toward the farther shore,
was a thick belt of trees about the mouth of the
stream, thinning out farther along the shore in both
directions. Neither among the trees nor on the
glades, could they discern anybody although Jack,
who had been thoughtful enough to bring along
their field glasses, scanned the prospect through
them a long time before passing them on to the
others, who did likewise.

âWell, so far so good,â said Jack, with a sigh
of relief. âEvidently, or so far as we can see, anyway,
Dad and the rest got across undiscovered and
now stand a fair chance of crossing the lake farther
up undetected.â

96

âMaybe so,â said Frank. âMaybe, too, Lupo got
discouraged and quit.â

âRetreated you mean?â asked Jack.

Frank nodded.

âOh, you fellows are full of prunes,â said Bob.
âWhy should he quit now, just because we have
added one more man to our forces? Heâs hung to
our trail a long time. That means heâs not going
to quit in a hurry. No, weâve got to keep our eyes
open.â

âThatâs right,â said Jack, thoughtfully, âIt wonât
do to get overconfident and relax our guard.â

âJust the same thereâs no sign of trouble now,â
said Frank. âAnd Iâve got a suggestion.â

âDonât lose the idea,â said Bob, anxiously. âHold
on to it. Ideas are rare.â

âWith some people yes,â said Frank, grinning.
âNot with me.â

âHuh.â

Bob clutched at Frank, but the other wriggled out
of his grasp.

âMy idea,â he said, âis to take a plunge in the
channel your father crossed, Jack. Iâm hot and
sticky and tired, and a swim would go fine just
before I turn in and leave Bob on watch. What do
you say?â

âSo Iâm to have the first watch, hey?â said Bob.
âItâs been all decided, has it? Well, well. All right,

97

run along, Frankie, me lad. Iâm not so anxious for
a swim. Iâll just start my watch here and now.â

âBob, youâre a good sport,â said Frank, throwing
an arm over the shoulders of his big chum, between
whom and himself was a depth of feeling which
seldom was expressed in words.

âOh, run along and take your swim.â

Bob playfully shoved the pair of them down the
hill. Laughing, they obeyed. As they disappeared
among the trees, Bob selected a spot at the base of
a spruce on the top of the knoll, sat down with the
glasses in his lap and his eyes on the westward shore
of the lake, where Lupoâs half-breeds had last been
seen, and prepared to keep watch. His back was
against the trunk of the tree, and he made himself as
comfortable as possible.

It was a really comfortable position and, when
one is tired and sitting idle, a comfortable position
is conducive to drowsiness. It was so with Bob.
He had had but little sleep in the last two days. He
had worked hard. The air was warm and drowsy,
as only the air of the short hot Summer of the north
country, when the sun never sets, can be. Presently
his head began to nod, and there was a buzzing in
his ears as of the drowsy hum of bees. He caught
himself, and sat bolt upright, rubbing his eyes
vigorously with his fists. Then he leaned back
against the tree trunk again, and again began to

98

nod. This time, the jerk with which he awakened
was longer in coming.

Bob got up and stretched.

âMustnât go to sleep,â he reflected. âNothing in
sight, though. Not much use to worry. Ho, hum.â

He resumed his seat. Imperceptibly, his eyes
drifted shut. He sat through the transition period
between sleeping and waking, unaware that he was
yielding to slumber, merely pleasantly conscious of
relaxed limbs and thoughts. Before he was aware
his head nodded, his eyes closed, his chin touched
his chest, and he slept.

Meanwhile Jack and Frank were thoroughly enjoying
their plunge. The water was warm, there
was no wind, and they swam, dived, floated to their
heartâs content. Neither realized the passage of
time until Frank, suddenly filled with compunction
at their long absence, while Bob kept watch,
scrambled ashore and looked at his watch, laid out
on top of his clothes.

âGreat guns, Jack,â he announced, âweâve been
gone an hour. Good old Bob. He was mighty nice
about sending us off to swim while he kept watch,
but you know he likes to swim, too. Heâll be thinking
itâs a low trick on our part to stay so long.
Maybe heâll want to come and take a plunge himself,
when one of us gets back to relieve him.â

99

Jack also had a guilty feeling and, as is the way
with most of us, attempted to make excuses.

âHe might just as well have come along,â he
said. âNothingâs going to happen.â

They were pulling on their clothes.

Suddenly they heard Bobâs voice raised in a distant
shout, calling their names. Then followed a
brisk outbreak of rifle shots.

100
CHAPTER XII.âTHE SURPRISE ATTACK.

âAn attack,â gasped Jack.

âAnd weâre not there to help old Bob,â cried
Frank, in an agony of apprehension. âCome on.
Donât stop to finish dressing.â

Shirt flapping out over his trousers, shoes unlaced,
Frank frantically buckled on his revolver and
cartridge belt, seized his rifle and started on a dead
run through the trees. Jack did likewise. As they
ran, they heard the shots continuing intermittently,
and then once moreâclearer and closer at hand, as
they neared the knollâcame Bobâs voice:

âFrank, Jack, theyâre rushing me. Look out for
yourselves.â

There was a crashing in the brush ahead.

âDown, Jack, some of them coming.â

The two flung themselves prone behind a spruce
whose low branches swept the ground. The sounds
were off to their left. A moment later the forms of
four men, hurrying towards the channel whence

101

they had just come, could be seen eight or ten yards
away.

Jackâs face was pale, his lips set. Frank was
trembling with excitement and fearânot for himself,
if the truth must be told, for the plucky lad was
not thinking of himself, but for his chum, who was
holding off the main attack alone.

âSteady, Frank,â whispered Jack. âBobâs life
depends on us. This is no time for false compunctions.
Youâll have to shoot to kill.â

âAll right, Jack.â

Then the two rifles spoke as one, and two of the
runners stumbled, flung out their arms to save themselves,
and pitched forward. The others spun about
towards the direction whence the boys had fired, but
a second time Frank and Jack fired, and they, too,
fell.

âNo time to see how badly they were hit,â said
Jack. âCome on. Old Bobâs still alive and
shooting.â

Forward they dashed once more, not neglecting,
however, to keep wary watch as they ran. No more
of the enemy were seen, however. There was a
sudden uproar ahead, the shots ceased. Cries of
astonishment, stupefaction, even a note of fear, went
up from several throats. Above all was a bull-like
roar that they readily identified as coming from
Bobâs throat.

102

Frankâs heart gave an exultant leap. He knew
that yell. It came only when Bob went berserk, and
fought with his hands. He had heard it when they
fought Mexican bandits, Chinese smugglers, rum
runners on Long Island and Incas in the Andes.
He knew well what it meant.

Almost at the same moment, they burst into the
glade at the base of the knoll, and came to a dead
halt, eyes popping, standing as if rooted to the spot.

But only for a moment. Then they started tearing
up the hillside, among the scattered trees. For
at the top was a whirling heap of figures, as if
caught up in a cyclone, and well they knew what it
portended. Somewhere in the center of the group
was big Bob, at close grips with the enemy, and
not caring how many they numbered.

Would they be in time? Could they help Bob
before some half-breed succeeded in sticking a knife
into him?

But Bob proved that he could handle his own
affairs, for while they were still several yards away,
first one and then another half-breed was spewed
from the miniature whirlwind, and then Bob could
be seen with several men clinging to his legs and
another on his back, attempting apparently to
throttle him. The big fellowâs hands went up and
back. They settled under the otherâs armpits.
There was a sudden mighty heave and wrench, and

103

then the man on Bobâs back came flying through the
air, straight for Bobâs two comrades. He had been
tossed from Bobâs shoulders, as a strong man would
toss a sack of meal. Frank and Jack leaped aside,
and the man struck the ground, rolled over and
over and then lay still, crumpled up against the
trunk of a spruce.

Recovering from their surprise, Jack and Frank
leaped forward. But their intervention was unnecessary.
Standing like a young Colossus, legs
apart, with a man wreathed about each, Bob bent
down. One big hand seized each by the neck.
Then the two heads were bumped together once,
twice. The half-breeds collapsed. Their grip on
Bobâs legs relaxed, and he tossed them aside, and
they, too, lay still. He had knocked them out.

Then Bob did a surprising thing. He leaped with
a murderous look for the two boys.

âMore of you, hey?â

They sprang aside nimbly, eluding his grasp.

âBob, Bob, itâs us.â

âWhat? What? Oh, youââ

Bob looked at them, the battle lust dying in his
eyes, and recognition dawning. It was followed
by a wide grin.

âOh, itâs you.â

âBob, old thing, that was the greatest fight in

104

history,â cried Frank, hysterically, clapping his
chum on the back.

âNever saw the like,â said Jack, doing likewise.
âThank God, Bob, youâre alive.â

âNever was more alive in my life,â said Bob.
âHey, theyâre running away.â

He darted away from his chums and sprang
downhill. True enough. The two whom he had
disposed of first, who had dropped out of the fight,
had gained their feet and were running madly
through the trees.

Jack ran after Bob and restrained him.

âLet them go, Bob. They are alone. There are
three others here we must tie up before they come
to.â

Bob followed him back to where Frank was bending
over the man whom the big fellow had tossed
over his head. The half-breed was recovering consciousness,
and beginning to moan.

âBroken arm, I think,â said Frank. âHeâll not
bother us. How about the two whose heads you
bumped together?â

âTheyâre recovering consciousness, too,â said
Jack. âNothing much the matter with them. We
had better tie them up, so they canât cause us any
trouble.â

âHere, take the other fellowâs belt and tie his
hands behind his back with it,â said Bob. At the

105

same time, he suited action to word in the case of
the nearer of the two, whipped off the fellowâs belt
and tied him with it.

âWonât they try to run away, Bob? Ought we to
tie their legs, too?â

âNo, weâll just keep an eye on them. Letâs take
a look at the other. If his arm is broken weâll have
to set it somehow, I guess. Rather pitch him in the
lake, though. Heâs a villainous looking rascal. Tried
to choke me, too, and darn near succeeded.â

While Frank kept an eye on the two other
prisoners, who had now recovered consciousness and
were beginning to realize their situation but lay still
under the threat of Frankâs rifle, Bob and Jack
examined the third man.

His senses were returning, and he moaned a good
deal. Examinations revealed, however, that his
arm had not been broken, merely badly wrenched.

âIâm mighty glad of that,â said Jack. âWeâd
have been up against it to set a broken arm.â

âOh, we could do it, all right, if necessary,â said
Bob. âBut Iâm glad, too, that it isnât necessary.
But, say, Jackââwith sudden recollection, and an
air of anxietyââthere were four more of these
scoundrels. Weâll have to look out for them.â

Jackâs voice shook a little as he replied.

âI think not, Bob,â he said. âFrank and I saw

106

them first. We ambushed them, practically. They
didnât have a chance.â

âYou donât meanââ

Jackâs gaze was steady but troubled.

âWe had to do it, old man,â he said. âIt was
our life or theirs. And yours, especially. When we
heard your shout, and those first shots, Frank went
wild with fear that you had been trapped while we
were away enjoying ourselves. And I guess I felt
as bad as he did.â

âHey, fellows,â interrupted Frank, hailing them,
âthe two that got away must have been all that were
left. Theyâve jumped in a canoe and are paddling
like mad for the mainland.â

âCan you see them?â called Jack, starting to the
top of the knoll to join his chum.

âHow would I know what they were doing if I
couldnât?â rejoined Frank. âYes, I can see them.
Look there.â

He pointed.

âTie up that other fellow, Bob, and make him
walk up here to join his little playmates,â Jack called
back.

Bob complied. The man groaned, but by now he
had fully recovered his senses, and he obeyed Bobâs
order to move with an alacrity that showed he stood
in abject fear of the husky young American.

Frank pointed out the fleeing men, who were

107

nearing the mainland, and paddling with superhuman
energy, as if fleeing from the Old Nick, no
less.

âThat accounts for all of them, I guess,â he said.
âSo we can sit down now, Bob, while you tell us
how it happened.â

âNot much to tell,â said Bob, sinking to a seated
position against the tree trunk. âExcept I went
to sleep and was almost surprised, but not quite.
My first intimation that the enemy was near was
when I heard somebody talking in the trees at the
foot of this knoll. Or, did I hear anybody? Was
it just the old sixth sense giving warning of danger?
I donât rightly know. At any rate, I woke with a
start and looking down through the trees saw a
bunch of half-breeds making their way towards the
other side of the island.

âI tell you I was scared. I felt guilty as sin.
Here I had promised to keep watch, and, instead,
had fallen asleep. As a result, the half-breeds had
landed on the island, and were heading for where
you fellows were swimming. I had endangered
your lives. What should I do? That was the
question.

âBut I didnât waste must time, puzzling over it.
I knew I had to give you fellows warning or you
would be taken by surprise. So I yelled to you as
loud as I could to look out. I guess they hadnât seen

108

me up till then. But when I yelled, they saw me
quick enough, and several of them opened fire, andâââ

âWait a minute, Bob,â Frank interrupted, his eyes
shining. âThey hadnât seen you, and you could
have let them pass without attracting their attention,
but you yelled, just to give us a chance for our white
alley. Thatâs, thatâsââ

âOh, forget it,â said Bob, uncomfortably. âYouâd
have done the same. Anyway,â he hurried on, âthey
split up into two groups, and one kept on going,
while the other rushed me before I could do much
shooting, andâwell, I guess you know the rest,â he
concluded, lamely.

âIâll say we do,â said Frank, gripping his big
comradeâs shoulder. âBoy, Iâll never see the like
of that fight again.â

âBut, Bob, I wonder why they rushed you instead
of trying to shoot you down,â said Jack.

âSearch me,â said Bob.

âIâll bet I know,â said Frank.

âWhat?â asked both.

âThey wanted to take you alive, Bob, for some
reason of their own. Probably, would have tried to
take us alive, too, if theyâd gotten the chance.â

âWell, maybe so,â said Bob. âAnyhow, thatâs
that. Now what shall we do?â

109
CHAPTER XIII.âMR. HAMPTON RECALLED.

Jack and Frank regarded each other with distaste
and even horror in their eyes.

âHas to be done, though,â said Jack, as if in
answer to a remark of Frankâs.

Frank nodded.

âI know.â

âWhat are you two chumps talking about?â asked
Bob.

âThose four men we shot down, you know,â
Frank explained.

âThink youââ

Bobâs question went uncompleted.

âI donât know,â Frank replied. âWe shot
straight. It was your life and ours against theirs.â

âWell, come on. I know how you feel, but I expect
thatâs the first thing to be attended to. If any
of them is no more than wounded, it will be up to us
to do what we can for him.â

âRight, Bob,â said Jack.

110

âCome on,â Frank said shortly, starting down
the hillside, in the direction of their successful,
though impromptu, ambuscade.

âGo easy,â warned Bob. âIf theyâre able to shoot,
theyâll take a crack at us.â

Bobâs advice was followed, and the trio approached
the spot warily. But precaution was needless,
or, while still some distance away, they could
see the four bodies outstretched motionless where
they had fallen. Frankâs face went white, and he
shuddered. Jack was pale. Big Bob, although
he had had no hand in the affray, had to take a grip
on himself, in order to force his laggard steps to
continue. Though many were the affairs of danger
in which they had been, the boys had never before
shot to kill nor had death been brought so close to
them.

Frank stopped. He was trembling violently.

âIâI canât look at them,â he gasped.

Bob threw an arm over his shoulders.

âYou and Jack stay here,â he ordered, gruffly. âI
had no hand in this. Iâm the fellow to attend to it.
Wait for me.â

At that Frank protested, and started to proceed.
But Bob shoved him back, kindly but firmly.

âThe pair of you have been through enough,â he
said. âDo as I say. Wait here.â

And with quick, firm step, keeping himself to the

111

task, he plunged on through the trees. For a moment
or two both Frank and Jack watched him fascinatedly,
then Frank sank down to a sitting position,
elbows propped on his knees, his face in his hands.
Jack faced about, and stared unseeing through the
trees.

Presently, Bobâs solid, crunching footsteps could
be heard approaching, and they looked up. His face
was grave, but unflinching.

âLook here, fellows,â he said, firmly, âmay as
well face the facts. All four were killed instantly.
Drilled through theââ But why discuss it? The
fact is, theyâre dead. They were rascals of the first
water, and, as you say, it was their lives or ours.
Self-preservation is the first law of Nature. Now,
what are we going to do about it? We havenât any
tools to dig with.â

Frank shook himself into alertness.

âLetâs get the axesâour outfit has someâand cut
off some spruce boughs and cover them over. Then
we can roll some stones on top.â

As quickly as possible, without speaking during
the task, and working feverishly, the three carried
out Frankâs idea. Then, back at camp, they sat
down and brewed a pot of coffee. The hot, scalding
liquid steadied their shaken nerves.

âGuess we better try to get in touch with your
father, Jack,â suggested Bob, at length.

112

âHow long have they been gone?â

Bob looked at his watch.

âThree hours. Seems like a lifetime.â

âThings have certainly happened fast,â said
Frank. âThank goodness, that party missed our
radio. If they had destroyed it, we would have
been out of luck.â

âMore luck than I deserve,â said Bob, savagely.
âThink of going to sleep on the job. If I had been
awake, they never would have been able to land.â

âForget it, Bob. You certainly have nothing to
reproach yourself with.â

âOh, thatâs nonsense,â said the big fellow. âIâm
always getting you into trouble.â

Frank smiled.

âYes, and then getting us out again,â he said.

âWell, letâs try the radio, anyway,â suggested
Jack. âTheyâve been gone three hours. With the
best of luck they canât have made more than eight or
ten miles, considering the detour they planned to
take, and everything.â

âCouldnât have gotten that far away in a straight
line,â said Frank.

âNo, I guess not. But what if they arenât
prepared for a call from us?â

âOh, with that improved ring set of yours, your
father will be proceeding fully equipped to hear
from you,â said Frank. âHe need only wear the

113

headphone, and I seem to remember he said on leaving
that he would keep it on most of the time.â

Jack nodded. The improvement in the ring set,
spoken of by Frank, had done away with the necessity
for the umbrella aerial.

âAll right,â he said. âIâll call Dad on 200 meters.
If he gets the message we ought to hear from him
shortly, for heâll at once unlimber the field transmitting
set and call us back.â

While Jack sent out a terse description of the fight
and its outcome, Frank and Bob decided to steady
their nerves by fishing and went down to the lakeside.
They had reasonable success and had pulled
out a number of fish when Jack joined them.

âSend out your message, Jack?â Frank inquired.

âYes, and heard from Father in reply, too.â

âWhat? Why, great guns, how long have we
been here? Surely, you canât have had time to hear
from your father?â

âBut, I have,â affirmed Jack. âYouâve been here
more than an hour.â

Bob and Frank looked at each other. In all that
time, neither had spoken a word. They had just
dozed over their lines, pulling in an occasional fish.
Frank laughed.

âI guess we went to sleep with our eyes open,â
he confessed. âWell, what did your father say?â

âThey made a long trek up the lake before crossing

114

over, and are not very far awayâsomewhere up
in that directionâon the other shore, there,â said
Jack, pointing. âDad was worried as the deuce at
my story, and theyâre coming back.â

âComing back? Why? Itâs all over now.â

âThatâs what I told him, Frank. But heâs coming
back, anyway. Theyâre going to get back to the
lake, and come straight down to the island. Ought
to be here in a couple of hours or less.â

âMay as well wait dinner for them, in that case,â
observed Bob. âOr what meal is it? Breakfast,
lunch, or dinner? Iâm sure I donât know. This perpetual
sunshine has me all turned around. I donât
know whether itâs day or night.â

âSame here,â confessed Frank. âI do know,
though, that Iâm beginning to get up an appetite.â
Then a thought, a thought which his somnolent daydreaming
over the fishing lines had driven away for
the time, crossed his mind, and he paled. âI donât
know thoughââcatching his breathââwhether Iâll
ever want to eat again.â

Jack looked at him sharply. So did Bob. The
big fellows noted with apprehension the twisted,
stricken look on their slighter chumâs face, and the
haunted appearance of his eyes. To Bobâs keen
eyes, moreover, two hectic spots glowing brightly
in the dark tan of Frankâs cheeks were apparent.

âLook here, old man,â said Bob, anxiously, âyou

115

want to quit thinking about that or youâll be sick.â

âSick?â Frank tried to force a laugh. âIâm the
healthiest invalid ever you saw.â

âNo, Frank, I mean it. Put that thought out of
your mind, or you will be sick. Whyââlaying a
hand on his browââyouâve got a fever right now.â

Jack was worried, too.

âGreat guns, Frank, you must take Bobâs advice.
What if you came down sick? Weâd be in a pretty
fix.â

âOh, you fellows make me tired,â said Frank, irritatedly.
âIâm all right.â

But Bobâs worry was not routed. He took his
chum by an arm and started marching him toward
camp.

âIâm going to give you a dose of calomel and
make you lie down,â he said. âCome on.â

âCalomel? Have a heart.â

âYes, calomel,â said Bob, firmly. âThatâs what
you need, that and a nap.â

Picking up the fish, Jack followed. And at the
camp, despite Frankâs vehement protests, he was
made to swallow a liberal dose of calomel, and then
to lie down on a couch of spruce boughs, over him
the little tent belonging to Mr. Hampton to provide
shade from the northern sun. Jack and Bob sat
down, some distance away, and started cleaning
the fish. They talked together in low tones.

116

Presently, after several glances toward the motionless
figure, Bob arose and tiptoed close to it. On
his return, he nodded, smiling slightly, at Jack.

âAsleep,â he said. âDidnât want to do it, but
overworked Nature was too much for him. Iâm a
little bit worried. His nerves got a severe shock.
But I guess heâll be all right when he wakes up.â

Then he glanced more keenly at Jack.

âLook here, youâve been through the same experience.
I had a nap. Now youâre going to take
one. Sleep will be good medicine for you, too. We
donât want two sick ones on our hands.â

Jack didnât protest, but also turned in beside
Frank, and in a few minutes was sound asleep. As
Bob had said, overworked Nature claimed her dues.

117
CHAPTER XIV.âA REVELATION.

This time Bob did not go to sleep on the job,
but at the first faint indication that somnolence was
stealing upon him, arose and stamped about vigorously.
Once, prompted by a humane inclination,
he paused by the three prisoners who lay in the
shade, hands and feet tied, and proffered them a
drink of water. The courtesy and thoughtfulness
was totally unexpected, as Bob could see by the
surprise in their eyes, although no words were exchanged,
and they drank eagerly in great gulps.
The half-breed whom Bob had pitched over his
head was in considerable pain because of his
wrenched arm, as Bob could see from his occasional
writhings, and Bob decided to chance trouble by
loosening his bonds. In addition, he rummaged
their stores and brought out a bottle of liniment for
sprains and bruises, with which he bathed the
twisted member.

âYou good man,â whispered the other, gazing at

118

him, as Bob bent to the task, and speaking in a
voice barely audible to Bobâs ears, and certainly not
to the other two men a short distance away. âI tell
you somethingânot nowâbimebyâwhen they not
know.â

Bob thought quickly.

âAll right,â he responded, in the same low tone.
âIâll fix it.â

âYes.â The other nodded. âYou fix it.â

âNow what in the world has he got to tell me?â
Bob asked himself, as he moved away. âProbably,
something about Lupo the Wolf. At any rate, I
canât see what else it can be. Was grateful because
I gentled him a littleâafter first maltreating him.â
He smiled at the irony of this thought. âWell, Mr.
Hampton will soon be here, no doubt. Then there
will be a chance to question him apart from his
fellows.â

And with that, he dismissed the matter from his
mind. Jack now rolled over, sat up and came out
from under the tent, yawning. Frank continued
sunk in heavy slumber.

âBy George,â said Bob, looking at his watch,
âtwo hours since you started to take your nap.
Run down to the shore, will you, and take a look
to see if there is any sign of your father. We
left these fellows alone onceâânodding to their
prisonersââbut I felt it wasnât wise to try it too

119

often. Something might happen. So Iâve been
sticking close to camp.â

Jack nodded.

âYes, that time you were fishing. It was foolish
for me to run down after you, but I just had to tell
you about hearing from Father.â

He set out for the shore.

A few minutes later, Bob heard his comrade give
a joyful shout. It was answered by a fainter hail
from the water. Faint though it was, however, it
was unmistakable. Mr. Hampton was approaching.

Presently there was a babble of voices approaching,
and the returning party came into view, Jack
in the lead flanked by his father and Farnum, with
MacDonald, Dick and Art bringing up the rear.
Jack was eagerly explaining what had occurred at
camp since his fatherâs departure.

âHello, Bob,â said Mr. Hampton, coming up,
and gripping the big fellowâs hand hard. âHad
some excitement while we were gone?â

âYes, we did, Mr. Hampton. Thought this was
going to be a loafing assignment you left us onânothing
to do but hang around camp and swim and
fishâand the minute you turn your backs something
happens.â

âHowâs Frank?â

âJack told you, did he?â

120

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âHeâs still asleep,â said Bob. âThe necessity of
shooting to kill was a shock to his nerves. Nature
took him in hand. See.â He indicated where Frank
lay as in a stupor in the tent, unmoved by the arrival
of the returning party.

âHeâll sleep for hours yet,â said Mr. Hampton,
âif we donât make too much noise. Iâll caution the
others. Best medicine in the world for him. Heâll
be all right when he wakes, I expect.â

While Dick put on the fish, for all were hungry,
Bob and Jack, in lowered voices, told the others all
that had occurred. Bob repeated his condemnation
of himself for having fallen asleep and permitted
the enemy to land unopposed, but Mr. Hampton
rested a hand on his shoulder, and told him not to
be foolish.

âIn the first place,â he said, âthere seemed to be
no reason why you should keep strict watch. It
hardly seemed likely these fellows would boldly approach
the island.â

âExpect they saw us set out, after all,â suggested
MacDonald, âand figured the whole party hadnât
gone, and that them left behind would be on âtother
side of the island, soâs they could land and surprise
âem.â

Nods of agreement followed this statement. It
was, indeed, the most likely explanation. Over the

121

puzzle as to why Bob had not been slain by those
attacking him, but who, instead, had tried merely
to make him prisoner, nobody had any suggestion
to offer other than that earlier advanced by the
boys themselves, that they enemy wished to take
them alive.

âReckon Lupo thought heâd get some information
from you,â said MacDonald.

âBut he wasnât here,â Bob protested.

âNo, but you can bet they were actinâ on his
orders.â

Bob bethought him of the prisoner, who had
whispered that he had something to tell him. He
explained to the others. Mr. Hampton thought for
a moment.

âI have it,â he said. âArt, bring the others here
and weâll question them. At the same time, Bob,
do you slip off and talk to your man. Weâll keep
the pair occupied, so that they wonât be able to see.
Tell your man that presently, then, weâll call him
up to be questioned, too, and that heâs to pretend
sullen obstinacy and refuseâin the presence of
his comradesâto answer any questions.â

Bob nodded and, as Art went for the pair, he
slipped away in an opposite direction. Executing
a flank movement through the trees, he presently
arrived on the opposite side of the camp and got
behind the tree, against which the man with the

122

wrenched shoulder was sitting. In a rapid whisper
he communicated Mr. Hamptonâs instructions to the
other. The fellow comprehended, and then in a low
tone, scarcely audible to Bob, who strained to hear,
communicated surprising intelligence.

Bob heard him out, then with a final word of
caution, again slipped away, once more skirted camp
through the trees, and approached the group from
the waterside. The two other half-breeds were being
grilled, but without success. At Bobâs approach,
Mr. Hampton turned again to Art.

âBring that other fellow here,â he commanded.
âSee if he knows any more than these men.â

The man was brought into the council, but, acting
on instructions, maintained an obstinate silence.

âOh, take them away, and feed them,â said Mr.
Hampton finally, as if despairing of obtaining any
information. âWeâll talk to them later, after Iâve
eaten. Dickâs fish will get cold if we donât fall to,
and Iâm too hungry to delay with these rascals.â

The men, whose ankle bonds had been removed,
were returned to the other side of the camp and,
with their hands untied, were permitted to eat under
the watchful eyes of Dick and Art. Then once
more they were tied up.

Meantime, Mr. Hampton turned eagerly to Bob,
as soon as the trio of prisoners was out of hearing.

123

âOut with it, Bob,â he said. âI can see youâre
dying to tell us. Must be important.â

âIt is,â said Bob, emphatically.

âWhat did he say?â

âMr. Hampton, you think weâre alone in this wilderness
except for Lupoâs gang?â

âI donât know who else would be here. This is
country that white men never get into.â

âWell, Thorwaldsson, Farrell and three followers
of their party of ten are not more than two hundred
miles away; perhaps less than that.â

âWhat! Say that again.â

Mr. Hampton was so excited he almost dropped
his portion of fish into the fire.

âItâs true,â said Bob. âAt least thatâs what this
fellow, Long Tom, declares. Long Tomâthatâs his
name.â

âHow does he know?â

It was MacDonald who asked the question, and
Bob turned to him.

âThatâs what I asked him. He said Thorwaldsson
had been attacked before he reached the oil
country, and Thorwaldsson, Farrell and four of his
men cut off from their camp. Those in the camp
were killed, and Thorwaldssonâs supplies looted.
He says a big band of Indians committed the outrage.â

âAt whose orders?â asked Mr. Hampton.

124

âMerely operating on their own, says Long Tom.
He was with them. They wanted the loot. What
they didnât understand, they destroyed.â

âThatâs why nothing has been heard of Thorwaldsson,â
said Mr. Hampton, âfor his radio equipment
must have been among âthe things they didnât
understand.â Go on, Bob.â

âLong Tom thinks Thorwaldsson spent the Winter
with the Eskimos up on the rim of the Arctic
Ocean.â

âWhere has he been? What became of the Indians?â

âThey were a hunting party, as far as I could
gather, who, after chasing Thorwaldsson up to the
Eskimos, left the country. But Long Tom wintered
with some Eskimos near Union Straits himself,
and this Spring started out. Then he fell in
with Lupo, who he knew, and joined him.â

âAnd how does he know where Thorwaldsson is
now? Why does he say Thorwaldsson is so close?â

âSays he ran across an Eskimo hunter on his way
out, who told of Thorwaldsson having wintered
with his tribe, and learned Thorwaldsson was on his
way out down the Coppermineâor up it, whichever
you choose to call it. Though that was weeks
ago, he believes Thorwaldsson would be following
watercourses that would put him about one hundred and

125

fifty or two hundred miles to the northeast
of us.â

âWell, Bob, you certainly learned a lot,â said Mr.
Hampton. âWas that everything? Or did Long
Tom know or have anything to say about Lupo?â

âHe doesnât know why Lupo is after us, except
that it has something to do with Thorwaldsson.
Thatâs all I could get out of him. Pretty indefinite,
but it was the best I could do.â

âIndefinite! Nonsense, Bob. That is something
to go on, indeed.â

âAnd to think that old Bob got it all just because
he was kind to a fellow with a sore arm and put
some liniment on it,â said Jack.

126
CHAPTER XV.âMACDONALD TURNS BACK.

Taking everything into consideration, Mr.
Hampton decided that before any further steps were
taken, the wisest plan would be for all to get a good
rest. Frank still lay as if in a stupor; Jack looked
and confessed to being shaky; even Bob was tired
from the strain of the terrific fight through which
he had gone, coming upon the top of many hours
of exhausting travel. As for the rest, they had done
practically three daysâ work with little or no rest
in the short interval between.

âAltogether,â said Mr. Hampton, summing up,
âwe are in no fit condition to set out in immediate
pursuit of Lupo and the remainder of his men, nor
even to decide wisely as to what to do. It may be
that the best plan would be not to pursue Lupo but
to set off at once to try and find Thorwaldsson. I,
for one, am too tired even to think straight. So
I vote that we make camp, set watches and turn in
for a good rest. I believe I could sleep the clock
around.â

127

âIf you think you can trust me with the first
watch, Mr. Hampton,â muttered Bob, shamefacedly,
âIâd like to have it. Iâll promise you not to go
to sleep on the job again.â

Mr. Hampton slapped the big fellow on the back
in kindly fashion, as Bob leaned forward, seated on
the ground beside him.

âForget it, Bob,â he said. âYou have nothing
with which to reproach yourself. Certainly you can
have the first watch, if you want it. I expect the
rest of us will be only too glad of the opportunity
to turn in at once. As to there being any further
danger, however, I very much doubt it. You boys
have given Lupo a terrible blow. With four men
killed and three prisoners, he must be short-handed.
If he had only twelve or fourteen, as we believe,
his number now is less than ours. The consequence
is, that I cannot conceive of his attempting again to
attack us here on the island. However, a watch
must be kept, so go to it.â

Everybody agreeing with this program, Bob took
the first watch and the rest scattered around the
camp, under the spruces, and soon were sleeping
soundly. When the time to change watches came,
with nothing alarming having broken the calm, Bob
waked MacDonald, and himself turned in. After
that, he did not have even a disturbing dream and
was disturbed by nothing until awakened by being

128

shaken. He looked up and found Frank bending
above him, his face alight with merriment.

âHey, which of the Seven Sleepers are you?â demanded
Frank.

Bob ignored the query, his mind leaping at once
to the picture of Frank as he had last seen him.
In his voice was a note of thankfulness at finding
Frank thus carefree, as he said:

âHow do you feel, old man?â

âNever better,â confessed Frank. âSleep is certainly
the right medicine, isnât it?â

âDonât I know it!â

Bob yawned luxuriously, and rubbed his eyes.

âCome on, Bob, letâs take a plunge in the channel.
Just got up myself. Itâll wake us up, make
us feel good. Everybodyâs up now, and Dick fixing
to get breakfast. He and Art and MacDonald are
fishing. Mr. Hampton and Farnum are talking
things over. And here comes Jack, just piled out
of the feathers, too. The three of us can have a
fine swim.â

Bob was agreeable to this proposition, and they
set out for the place where Frank and Jack had gone
in for a plunge before. Without referring to the
tragic little mound beneath which lay the bodies of
the four half-breeds shot down by Frank and Jack,
the boys, as if by common consent, lay their course
through the trees so as to avoid passing near it.

129

The water, as Frank had predicted, was delightfully
invigorating, and refreshed and with the young
blood tingling in their veins, after a long sleep and
a good swim, they returned to camp. They brought
voracious appetites with them, but fortunately the
fishermen had pulled in a big haul of beauties, and
these, together with flapjacks made by that skillful
chef, Art, and washed down with coffee tasting like
none ever made in city restaurants, the whole having
the tang of the outdoors and woodland smoke for
sauce, made a delectable repast.

âNow,â said Mr. Hampton, at its conclusion,
ânow for a discussion of whatâs to be done.â

Thereupon he set forth the facts of the situation.
Lupo with five or six men at most was still at large.
He might have turned back. He might be in hiding
nearby. He might have gone on ahead in
search of Thorwaldsson. In any case, Mr. Hampton
declared, he felt it would be a waste of time to
search for him in view of the fact that they had
learned Thorwaldsson was somewhere to the north
and east and their primary object was to join forces
with that explorer. He wanted to know what the
others had to say.

Farnum, who had been talking matters over with
Mr. Hampton, sat silent, nodding approval. The
other was stating his own views. But MacDonald
voiced a protest.

130

âFrom your point of view, sir,â he said, âI reckon
youâre right. But am I to let Lupo escape now that
I come so close to gettinâ him? And what am I to
do with three prisoners on my hands?â

âIâve been turning that phase of the situation over
and over,â said Mr. Hampton. âI cannot see that
we can afford to diverge in pursuit of Lupo, now
that we have pretty definite information through that
fellow, Long Tom, of Thorwaldssonâs presence
alive and with some of his men in this wilderness.
I know what a blow it will be to you to give up the
chase, but it canât be helped. You have three prisoners,
and canât very well watch them and pursue
Lupo, too. They are criminals, and as a member
of the Mounted you must take them in. We canât
leave you to handle them alone, however, andâââ

He paused.

âAnd what, sir,â prompted MacDonald.

âWell, the least we can do, MacDonald, is to
leave one of our number with you. That will enable
you to keep guard against surprise, watch over
your prisoners, and wait for the arrival of aid from
your Post. Weâll wireless your Captain Jameson
full details of all that has occurred, give him your
position here, and then you can wait for relief.â

MacDonald looked thoughtful. He was silent
several minutes, while none spoke, but all watched
him expectantly.

131

âIf you wonât help me try and round up Lupo,
you wonât, and thatâs all there is to it,â he said, finally.
âNot as I blame you, neither. You got your
job, to git hold of Thorwaldsson and help him. With
only a handful oâ men he may be in trouble, too.
Seems natural-like, if whoever is agin you fellows
sent this cutthroat Lupo to cut you off, heâd likely
be after Thorwaldsson, too.â

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âThatâs what Iâm afraid of,â he said, âthat Thorwaldsson
may need our aid.â

âJust so,â continued MacDonald. âSuch beinâ
the case, your best plan is to try and find him soon
as you can.â

âThen you agree to my plan?â

âNot so fast,â said MacDonald. âYouâll give me
a man, hey?â

âYes.â

âWho?â

âWhyâIâââ

âGive me this feller,â said MacDonald, laying a
hand on Bob who sat beside him. âHeâs a fighter.â

âI couldnât do that, MacDonald. The boys must
come with me.â

âAll right. Only that fight he put upâthat was
a good one. Kind oâ wished I could have him by
me. Well, then, let me have this feller. Kin see

132

heâs used to big woods and river country. Heâd
make a good Mounty.â

This time MacDonald pointed the stem of his
pipe at Dick.

âWhat do you say, Dick?â asked Mr. Hampton.
âItâs up to you?â

âIâd have to go out with the Mounties to their
Post, wouldnât I? Probably have to winter there.â

MacDonald nodded.

âGet you a job on the Force,â he said.

Dickâs eyes shone. Middle-aged though he was,
he was alone in life, loved the wilderness, and still
thrilled to adventure.

âThat so?â he asked. âNeed men?â

âAlways room for a good one.â

âAll right. Itâs a go,â said Dick.

MacDonald nodded approval, spat in the fire, then
turned again to Mr. Hampton.

âSuch being the case,â he said, âwhen you talk
to Captain Jameson over that there contraption, just
tell him Iâm on my way in.â

âWhat?â

âSure. Think Dick and me would sit here with
three no-account breeds on our hands and wait for
help from four hundred miles away to arrive? No.
Weâll take âem in.â

âBut two of you, alone, and with three prisoners
on your hands!â

133

âNothing to that. Once I brought in four single-handed.
Never thought of calling for help except
I had luck enough to capture Lupo and more of his
gang.â

Mr. Hampton looked astounded. He turned to
Dick.

âBut how about you, Dick?â

âIf MacDonald says so, Iâm game.â

âKnew you would be,â said MacDonald. âThatâs
settled. Now call Captain Jameson, and letâs get
goinâ. You want to be on your way, and we may
as well be on ours.â

âBut, MacDonald,â said Mr. Hampton, trying one
last protest, âsuppose Lupo and the remainder of
his gang see you start, and follow and attack you.
What then?â

âHuh.â MacDonaldâs eyes snapped. âCouldnât
ask for no better luck. Iâd get a shot at him then.â

Farnum interrupted at this stage.

âItâs no use trying to stop him and Dick,â he
said. âI know Dick and I know these men of the
Mounted. Theyâre holy terrors. And the pair of
them will get away with it, too.â

Mr. Hampton knew when he was beaten, and
abandoned his protests. Captain Jameson once more
was called by wireless, and given a full account of
what had occurred. He approved MacDonaldâs

134

scheme and promised there would be a position on
the Force for Dick when he arrived.

âWell, Dick,â said Mr. Hampton, after all arrangements
were made for departure, and he led
him aside, âIâve been pleased, indeed, with your
ready help and cheerfulness on the trip. I hate to
part company with you. Here is a check for the
full sum I promised you for this Summerâs work.
And here in addition is something to remember
me by.â

Into Dickâs unwilling hand he pressed a handsome
gold watch which he himself had worn for
some years.

âOh, Mr. Hampton, this is too good for a rough
fellow like me to carry,â protested Dick.

âNow, now, nonsense,â said Mr. Hampton.
âNothing is too good for you, old man. I want you
to keep that to remember me by.â

âI donât need the watch for that, sir,â said Dick
gruffly, sticking it in his pocket nevertheless.

135
CHAPTER XVI.âREINDEER SIGHTED.

The big canoe which Dick and Art had captured
from the Indians was turned over to MacDonald.
It was easily capable of transporting fiveâthe three
prisoners, MacDonald and Dick. With the two latter
in the bow and stern respectively, and the prisoners
unarmed between, there was little danger so
long as MacDonald and Dick maintained reasonable
watchfulness. Two of the half-breeds were cowed
and broken in spirit, moreover, while Long Tom
was
hors de combat
on account of the injury to his
arm, and would be for some time to come. MacDonaldâs
skin kayak was to be towed behind, containing
his slender outfit, and one of the prisoners
could carry the whole business alone at portages.

MacDonald had entered the lake by a considerable
stream flowing into it from the southwest, and
not the stream down which the Hampton party had
come. He set out for this other stream before the
others quit the island, with the intention of retracing

136

his steps into the wilderness in large measure.
This would facilitate his travel. Farther to the
south, he said, was a large river which could be
reached by a ten-mile portage, and down which
they could travel for many miles.

âIf you ever want to join the Mounted,â he said
to Bob, to whom he had taken a great fancy, âlet
me know. Iâll fix it for you.â

Bob laughed, but he was young enough to be flattered
by the sincere compliment.

âI may take you up on that some day,â he said.
âWho knows?â

Then MacDonald stepped into the canoe, goodbyes
were said, and the craft shot away.

âThere go a couple of good men,â commented
Farnum, as under the powerful strokes of the paddles
the canoe drew swiftly down the lake.

âOne good man, anyhow,â said Art, who overheard
the observation. âOlâ Dick anâ me had a liâl
talk. Iâm going to join up with the Mounted, too,
when we git back. We been pals fifteen year.â

âFifteen years,â exclaimed Frank. âIn the wilderness
all that time?â

Art nodded absently, his eyes on the retreating
canoe.

âSure,â said Art. âItâs home to us. Ainât no
wilderness. Cities is the real wilderness. Dick anâ
meâs been separated now and then, like now, but we

137

always come together agin. I expect when we git
to be old men like some prospectors I seen weâll be
together all the time, fightinâ and jawinâ each other,
but ready to tear the heart out oâ anybody that
jumps one of us.â

âItâs a wonder Dick went off with MacDonald
like he did, in that case,â said Jack.

âHuh. Somebody had to go. He knew weâd
meet agin.â

Art said no more, but turned away to busy himself
with the outfit.

Presently everything was in readiness for departure
and then the two remaining canoes, with the
outfit distributed between them, the three boys in
one and the three men in the other, started up the
lake in the opposite direction from that taken by
MacDonald and Dick. Previously, when in pursuit
of Lupo, Mr. Hampton had discovered the lake was
of so considerable extent that, despite their hours
of travel up the side, they had been unable to discern
the farther end. In fact, the lake broadened
out considerably some distance beyond the island.
It was his intention, inasmuch as it followed the
general northeastward direction they would pursue,
to stick to it as long as possible. He believed there
would be some stream at the farther end sufficiently
large to float their canoes.

In this he was not mistaken, for after four hours

138

of steady paddling, they discerned the outlet of a
stream of considerable width, quartered across the
lake and entered it. Almost immediately Jack called
to his father, in surprise:

âDad! Oh, Dad! This stream flows out of the
lake; not into it. Do you notice?â

The leading canoe slowed up while the boys approached.

âIt certainly does, Jack,â said his father. âWhat
do you make of it, Farnum?â

The latter shook his head, puzzled.

âI donât know,â he said. âYou must remember
this is unexplored country. Weâre liable to find
anything here. But, maybeâââ

âWhat?â

âI donât know. Weâre near the Coppermine,
arenât we, Art?â

âFigure we must be.â

âMaybe this stream flows into the Coppermine.â

âIâll bet thatâs it,â Art approved. âThe waters
of that lake empty into the Coppermine. Yes, sir;
Iâll bet thatâs what it is. Well, that makes travel
easy for awhile, anyhow.â

Two days of travel, unbroken by any but routine
incidents such as the occasional shooting of wild duck
Or geese, brought the party at camping time at the
end of the second day to a pleasant, open, grassy

139

prairie between two low-wooded hills. Here it was
decided to make camp.

After the evening meal was over, and while Mr.
Hampton, who was feeling out of sorts, retired to
his little tent to try and sleep without taking part
in the usual desultory conversation about the fireâwhich
was kept going for the companionship and
cheer it imparted and not from any need of warmth
you may be sureâJack arose and stretched.

âMy legs are stiff from that position in the canoe
all day,â he said. âI want to stretch them a bit.
Whoâll come with me to the top of that nearest hill?
The sun is pretty low, but we ought to get a considerable
view.â

Bob and Frank both volunteered to accompany
him. Farnum sat, smoking his pipe and staring into
the fire absently. He didnât care to go. But Art
arose and joined the party. It was not far to the
top of the hill, although a stiff climb through the
trees and brush. The crest, however, was bare of
timber.

Frank, who lighter than the others, was first to
reach the top, stood struck with amazement. He
turned to beckon the others forward with one hand,
while laying the other over his mouth in a gesture
enjoining silence.

âFor the love oâ Pete,â whispered Art, eyes bulging,
as he stood beside Frank and peered down into

140

the grassy vale beyond, half overgrown with young
willows.

âAre they caribou?â asked Jack, low-voiced.
âThey donât look like the caribou weâve run across
along the streams.â

âThey ainât, neither,â said Art. âTheyâre reindeer.â

âMust be Santy Clausâs,â chuckled Bob. âAlways
did believe there was something to that story about
the old boy living up here near the North Pole, even
though people insisted on calling it a fairy tale. Now
I know.â

His joke was ignored, however, as Art continued:

âYes, sir, reindeer. Caribou are always brown.
Some oâ these are white, some brown, and some
spotted. Then they ainât the size oâ caribou. Besides,
I know theyâre reindeer. I see âem often
enough in Alaska to know.â

âAlaska? Do these reindeer come from there?â

Art nodded.

âLook at âem. Theyâre tame. Mustâa winded us,
but that donât scare âem none. Theyâre used to
humans. No more scared oâ beinâ hunted than cattle
are back in the States.â

âTame?â queried Frank. âWhat do you mean?â

âWhy, the Eskimos in Alaska, not the wild one,
of this Far North, but the regular ones that come
in touch with the white man, they keep herds oâ reindeer

141

just like a farmer in the States keeps cows.
Look at âem. Must be two-three hundred there
right now. Theyâre eight-ten hundred miles from
home, too. Must âa wandered away. Bet you thereâs
a desprit Eskimo lookinâ for âem right now.â

Jack looked thoughtful.

âWhat a shame for a man to lose a big herd like
that,â he said.

âYes, sir,â affirmed Art emphatically. âMust be
six-seven thousand dollars worth oâ tame reindeer
there. Pretty tough.â

âWe canât do anything about it, though,â said
Bob.

âSeems a pity-like we canât ride herd on âem till
some Eskimo shows up to claim âem,â said Art. âBut
it canât be done. Yore father, Jack, is all for pushinâ
on fast as we kin.â

After some further discussion, the party retraced
its steps, with Art explaining to the boys the big
difference existing between the semi-civilized
Eskimos of Alaska and the little that was known of
the wild Eskimos of the Arctic.

âFolks think Alaskaâs right up next to the North
Pole,â he said. âLeastways folks in the States do.
People cominâ to Nome from the States every so
often give me that knowledge. But theyâre shore
mistaken. Alaskaâs great country thatâll be settled
up some day. Shore, we got hard Winters. But

142

boys, in the Summer, with the sun a-shininâ all the
time, everything grows just three times as fast as
in the States. My Pap was a farmer back in York
State, anâ I was raised on a farm. We had hard
scratchinâ anâ our Winters was long anâ hard, too.
Anâ we didnât have Summers like in Alaska to
make up for âem. Iâll bet if my Pap were livinâ
today anâ farminâ in Alaska heâd find life a lot easier
than what we had it on the old farm.â

âBut why donât more people live in Alaska, then?â
asked Frank.

âOh, I donât know. Hard to get to, for one thing.
Ainât developed up with railroads, neither. Some
day, though, youâll see âem forced to come here, the
way theyâre a-crowdinâ up down in the States. Why,
we got only 60,000 people in all Alaska, yet sheâs
quarter as big as the States anâ could darn near
feed the whole push herself, if she was put to it and
farmed right.â

âArt, why donât you go to farming? Iâd think
that would be the thing for you to do.â

âMebbe I will some day,â said Art. âBut Iâm
an old batch. Got no wife, anâ kind oâ like to feel
free to knock around instead oâ beinâ tied to one
place.â

It was a feeling with which the boys could sympathize.
They were young, with life ahead of them,
and they wanted to see the world. In fact they

143

had seen a good deal of it already, as those who have
followed them through their various adventures,
know. Of this they spoke as they made their way
back to camp, where they discovered Farnum ready
to turn in, and merely awaiting their return before
doing so. Since their first encounter with Lupo,
and their discovery that they were not alone in the
wilderness, a watch was always kept, and Farnum
had combatted sleepiness in order to keep guard
until their return.

âArt, youâve got the first watch,â he said, when
they appeared. âThe rest of you better turn in,
and not sit up talking. With luck we ought to
make the Coppermine tomorrow, I figure, and then
weâll do some traveling. Weâve got to hit a fast
pace from now on, for already we are having real
twilight, and pretty soon weâll be having short
nights while the sun dips entirely below the horizon.
That means the season is growing short, and we
have not got much time left before weâll have to
start for the outside.â

Jack and Bob heeded the injunction and followed
Farnumâs example shortly, but Frank, who
did not feel sleepy and, moreover, loved to talk, sat
up a considerable time gossiping with Art and telling
him of some of their previous adventures.

Suddenly, as he talked along, low-voiced so as

144

not disturb the nearby sleepers, Frank noticed Art
was not paying attention, and stopped.

âOh, well,â he said, half petulantly, âif Iâm boring
youâââ

Art leaned close, and laid a hand on his arm.

âSorry, Frank,â he said, in a whisper, âbut I was
a-listenin.â I got a strange feelinâ like as if somebody
had his eyes on the back aâ my head. I
wasnât payinâ no attention to you but a-listeninâ to
see if I could hear anything.â

He was so intense that he communicated some
of his trepidation to Frank. Instinctively, the
latter reached for his rifle as Art half stood up
to peer at their twilit surroundings. They were
camped in a tiny grove of a half dozen spruces, like
an islet in a midst of long, matted grass.

As Art stood up, a single shot rang out, shattering
the stillness. He threw himself prone, dragging
Frank down with him. Then a fusillade was
poured in on them, seemingly from all sides.

145
CHAPTER XVII.âSURPRISED.

âWatch my back, Frank. Keep low behind
that nearest tree and let âem have it. Theyâre in
that long grass.â

As he spoke Art, worming his way rapidly forward
to a position behind the trunk of one of the
spruces, began firing rapidly.

Frank, in the opposite direction, fired several shots
into the long grass. He had an uncanny feeling,
for he could see no forms at which to fire, and the
preliminary volley poured into the camp was not
repeated, so he had no index as to the enemy
positions.

Jack, Bob and Farnum, rolled over, awakened
by the shots, but Frank called fiercely: âKeep
down.â

Realizing something of the situation, the three
grabbed their rifles, laying by their sides, and,
keeping down, prepared to fire as soon as they could
see something at which to aim.

146

Mr. Hampton stirred in his tent a moment later.
He had been sleeping hard, and had not awakened
instantly as had the others. Moreover, a dull ache
gripped his head, preventing him from thinking
clearly and from comprehending instantly what was
occurring. He lay a moment, wondering what had
awakened him. All was still outside, for Frank and
Art had ceased firing to await some sign from the
unseen enemy. Mr. Hampton decided to peer out
and investigate what had disturbed him. He
crawled from his dog tent and stood up.

At his appearance, a ragged volley burst once
more from the long grass surrounding the tiny
grove, for his figure stood forth clearly and made
an excellent target. Spinning about, Mr. Hampton
fell heavily to the ground.

A wild yell of triumph went up at this indication
that the leader had been hit. Jack leaped up regardless
of consequences and ran to his father,
dragging him into the tent, while bullets whipped
around him. Bob ran to his assistance. To the
hidden enemy it must have seemed as if their opponents
were demoralized. At any rate, they grew
more courageous, and started a rush.

From three sides, it came, the figures of the oncoming
men only partially seen as they crouched
low and darted through the grass. But the long
stems waving above them marked their paths, and

147

there were three still on watch who would have to
be dealt with.

Frank, Art and Farnum marked where the waving
grass indicated the enemy. Each guarded a
side of the little grove. On the fourth side lay the
stream.

âWaitâll theyâre close, fellows, then give it to âem,â
cautioned Farnum. âReady. Letâs go.â

The three repeating rifles spoke as one, and from
the long grass came howls and shrieks of pain and
terror. What followed was brief but lively. Each
of the three pumped his rifle as fast as possible, and
the bullets poured into the grass almost as fast as
if sprayed from the throat of a machine gun. The
return fire was heavy but high, whipping through
the branches of the spruce trees overhead.

Reinforcements added to the strength of the
defenders, for Bob darted out of the tent, crouched
over, and flung himself beside Frank, beginning to
shoot even as he talked.

âMr. Hampton escaped by a miracle,â he said.
âBullet creased his head and stunted him. Heâll be
all right.â

The rush was broken. Whoever was in the grass,
feared to advance farther in the face of that fire.
The long grass ceased to wave, indicating the attackers
had come to a halt. But they did not retreat.
The menace was still there.

148

âAnybody hit?â Farnum called out.

âNot me,â said Art.

âNor me,â answered Frank.

âThank our lucky stars for that,â answered
Farnum.

They all lay in a semi-circle, facing different directions,
but close enough to each other to make communication
in ordinary tones possible. Relieved to
discover that all were untouched, despite the bullets
that had rained on the camp, Farnum next inquired
anxiously after Mr. Hampton, and Bob answered he
had been only stunned.

âI reckon these fellows are Lupo and his gang,â
Farnum remarked. âBut he must have had more
men than we expected, or he wouldnât be attacking
us like this.â

âWhatâll we do?â growled Art. âLooks like they
got us penned in.â

âOh, but we stopped their rush,â protested Frank.

âYes,â said Art, âbut they ainât beatinâ it as I
can see. Anâ when we want to up anâ leave camp,
whatâs goinâ to happen?â

Frank was about to reply, when Bob who was
beside him, pointed with his rifle toward the gap
between the two hills, from the top of one of which
they earlier had seen the reindeer herd in the next
valley.

149

âLook there, Frank,â he exclaimed excitedly.
âWhat do you make of that?â

âWhere? I donâtââOh, yes; now I see. Something
moving.â

âSure is something moving,â Bob said.

Already the short twilight was beginning to
lighten, as the sun after its dip to the edge of the
northern horizon now swung higher.

âBob.â

âWhat?â

âI believe thatâs the reindeer herd.â

âFrom that valley over the hill? The reindeer we
saw when we were up there on the hill top?â

âYes, sir.â

âBut how in the world?â

âWhy, I noticed that the other valley swung
around between those two little hills. The reindeer
are just grazing along, hunting new pasture. And,
say, Bob!â

âWell, what now?â

âIâve got a bully idea.â

Abruptly, Frank wormed his way around to face
Art on his right, who was keeping watch against
surprise on his side of the little clump of trees
sheltering them.

âArt,â said he, âlook over there, between those
two little hills. Are those reindeer? The reindeer
we saw from the hilltop?â

150

âReckon so,â said Art, after a critical inspection.

âWell, Art, can reindeer be stampeded? Like
cattle, I mean.â

âReckon so. Why?â

âWell, Iâm going to try it,â Frank declared in a
determined tone. Still prone, he began to wriggle
out of his clothes, and pulling up his legs, to unlace
his boots and kick them off.

âAre you crazy, Frank?â Bob demanded, puzzled,
while Art and Farnum took their eyes from the
coverts ahead to look at Frank in astonishment.

âCrazy? No more than usual,â Frank replied, as
he completed disrobing, and now lay naked under
the spreading branches of the spruce. âBut Iâm
going to slip into the water and float down to that
hill, then get in behind the reindeer and stampede
them. You see whatâll happen then, donât you?â

Bob stared at his companion, wide-eyed. Dawning
comprehension crept into his eyes, and he began
to smile. Then he chuckled.

âYou little hound,â he said, employing a pet expression
among the boys, denoting admiration.

âBut, say, whatâs the idea?â demanded Art
sharply, from his position several yards away.

Frank had started wriggling forward, and
waited until he was close to Art and Farnum before
replying. Then he repeated his assertion that he
intended floating downstream until behind the slow-moving

151

herd of reindeer, when he would land and
attempt to stampede them.

âYou see how it is,â he said. âYou yourselves
admit that weâre in a tight place. Lupoâs forces
have cover in that long grass, and can wait us out.
Here among the trees there is no grass to hide us.
The minute we get up and start to move around,
we expose ourselves. Therefore, the best thing to
do, is to drive them out of their cover, isnât it?â

âSure,â said Art. âBut how you going to do it
withâââ

He was about to ask how Frank intended to drive
their enemies from cover by stampeding the reindeer,
but Frank grinned at him, and he paused. Dawning
comprehension came into his eyes, too.

âThatâs it,â Frank said. âI see you get my idea.â

He turned his gaze toward Farnum, farthest from
the center, but who had overheard the conversation.

âYou see, Mr. Farnum,â he said, âwhen the reindeer
come dashing down, Lupoâs men will have to
run for it to get out of the way. A stampeding
herd isnât anything to monkey with, I expect. Then
youâll have your chance. But the reindeer wonât
dash in among these few close-set trees, so youâll
be safe. No, sir; as I figure it, theyâll just head
right on past here and try to get through the hills
beyond.â

152

Farnumâs glance approved.

âA fine idea,â he said, but then he added in a
tone of doubt: âI donât know as I ought to let you
go, though. Mr. Hampton wouldnât like it, maybe,
putting yourself into danger like that.â

âOh, nonsense,â said Frank. âI can slip unseen
into the water. And I can swim like a seal. Ask
Bob.â

And at once, to prevent any interruption of his
plans, he resumed worming his way to the bank
of the river.

The river ran at this point between six-foot banks,
and the clump of trees in which camp was situated
stood so close to the water that the roots of several
projected through the soil of the land. Frank had
little difficulty in getting down to the water, and felt
sure that he accomplished the feat unseen by the
enemy. He let himself into the stream, which was
of sufficient depth right up to the bank to enable him
to float downstream under the protection of the high
bank, without the necessity of wading out to get to
deeper water.

âFor Godâs sake, be careful, boy,â whispered Farnum,
as Frank disappeared.

Frank was naked, and unarmed except for a long
knife. He had not figured out how he would set
about stampeding the reindeer. He was leaving that
to chance. What concerned him now was to get to

153

a position behind the herd without discovery. He
stuck close inshore, floating, his eyes roving along
the edge of the bluff above him for signs of the
enemy.

None was to be seen. After all, he thought, it
was hardly likely that any of the enemy lay in hiding
here, as none of the shots fired at them had come
from so close to the river. On the contrary, the
enemy lay inland, showing they had come upon the
camp from the landward side. Becoming bolder,
therefore, he turned over and struck out, swimming
strongly, the long knife in a sheath at his belt. He
felt for it several times, to reassure himself it was
there and had not fallen out.

Frank was a strong swimmer. Indeed, this was
the one athletic sport at which he excelled both Bob
and Jack, although they, too, were excellent swimmers.
It did not take him long, therefore, aided by
the current, to come abreast of the trees clothing the
first of the two hills between which the reindeer had
entered their valley. The hill sloped abruptly down
to the water, and Frank had marked from camp how
trees clothed it entirely, even dipping into the stream.
When he had passed, as he believed, beyond a point
at which there was any possibility of his being seen,
he seized a branch of a willow tree and pulled himself
ashore. Then, after climbing a short distance
up the hill, he began working his way around it

154

through the trees. Presently he was on the hillside
facing the valley where were his friends in the
distant clump of trees, and the enemy hidden in the
long grass. The reindeer had not moved far. They
were only a short distance from him, and Frank
hurried forward at the best pace he could command.

155
CHAPTER XVIII.âTHE STAMPEDE.

For the first time since starting on his wild project,
a doubt as to its success entered Frankâs mind. But
he put it resolutely aside as he sped forward,
crouching, sliding under the low branches, determined
to make the best speed possible. His companions
were in a ticklish situation. He wanted to
do what he could to relieve them as soon as possible.
As to his own danger, he gave it not a thought.

What worried Frank was the possibility that he
would be unable to stampede the reindeer herd.
This was the thought which he put aside. But it
kept recurring. And when he had come into position
behind the herd, and saw them feeding quietly
below him, not a stoneâs throw away, at the foot of
the hill, where the trees ended abruptly and the grassy
plain began, he was still without an idea as to
what to do.

Originally, he had thought that stoning the herd

156

might set them into motion and stampede them forward.
But doubt as to the workability of that method
had seized him as he first climbed from the water
and, from among the trees, obtained his first view
of the herd. The animals, grazing quietly, were
so well spread out that he feared stoning them would
not alarm them sufficiently to start a stampede.

âWell, here goes for a try, anyway,â he muttered
to himself.

Fortunately, there were numerous pieces of rock
lying about. Collecting a heap of these, he began
pelting away at the nearest reindeer, a brown and
white spotted cow. His aim was good, and the
startled animal, struck on the flank, snorted, tossed
her head and gave a little jump. She went forward
only a step or two, however, and then settled down
to grazing again.

Once more Frank let fly, and this time the stone
caught her on the side of the neck. She tossed her
head angrily, and sidled forward again. The movement
brought her sharply into contact with another
cow, and for a moment Frank was filled with hope
that the pair would start fighting and alarm the rest
of the herd. He was disappointed. The first cow
sheered away from the other, and both resumed
grazing.

What should he do now? Frank was perplexed.
He had already considered the possibility of startling

157

the reindeer by shouting at them, but had given up
that idea because it would apprise the hidden enemy
in the grass ahead of his presence. He wanted them
to know nothing of the menace in their rear until
the stampeded herd should sweep down upon them.

âI wonderâââ he said, muttering the words for
the comfort of hearing his own voice.

Then he fell silent, thinking. Art had said they
were tame reindeer, accustomed to the presence of
man. Yes, but of man clothed and in his natural
state. And of Eskimos at thatâmen dressed a
good deal differently from the way in which he ordinarily
clothed himself. What would those reindeer
think if they saw a naked, white body dash down
upon them suddenly?

âIâll do it,â he said. âThatâs the only way. And
it will work, too, Iâll bet.â

Drawing his long knife from the sheath, he looked
around and selected a tough branch the thickness
of his thumb. This he cut off, stripped from it the
projecting twigs, and made of it a long, pliant whip.

Whip in one hand, knife in the other, eyes gleaming
and determined, Frank made his way to the edge
of the trees, and then stole out into the long grass,
crouching low. He did not want the reindeer to
see him until he was upon them, and as they were
grazing away from him, this was not so difficult.

158

In fact, he was within several yards of a clump of
cows before one swung about and looked at him.

The minute that occurred, Frank realized there
was no longer any possibility of concealment, and
that the time had come to strike. And strike he did.
Jumping to his feet, he bounded forward, swinging
his whip so that it sank through the air.

Bringing the whip down with a cruel lash on the
flank of the nearest reindeer, Frank swung it around
on all sides. Every swing landed. The swish as
the pliant green wood struck the animals reminded
him oddly of the sound of a stick beating rugs at
home. Many a time he had heard that same thud-thud
from behind his house.

Not a sound did he make as he lashed about him,
for he felt that if no sound indicating that he was
human came from him, the consternation of the reindeer
would be increased.

And that he had not miscalculated became at once
apparent, for the reindeer near him lifted up their
sharp little hooves and sprang to get out of the vicinity
of this strange animal with the lash. Naturally,
to escape him, there was only one way for them to
go, and that was forward, so forward they went.
Right into the main body of the herd they dashed,
with Frank prancing and bounding behind them,
with each leap bringing his whip down upon the
flank of a laggard.

159

Suddenly, one reindeer, nearer than the rest,
dashed by so close on his right as to brush Frank.
He was not being charged. The animal was panicky,
and merely seeking to escape. But he had to
leap nimbly aside to avoid being bowled over. And
as he leaped, the long knife clutched in his hand
pricked the animalâs flank.

The reindeer screamed, a shrill, terror-stricken
cry, and launched itself forward like a thunderbolt
into the midst of the disturbed herd. That, apparently,
was all that was needed to complete the
impending panic. Frankâs inexperienced eye could
not have told the composition of the herd, but Art,
when they had first caught sight of the reindeer
from the hilltop, had pointed out the majority were
cows, and the bucks numbered only a handful. If
any buck had a masculine curiosity to discover what
this strange white-skinned animal that looked so like
and yet so unlike a man was, he did not get the
chance to gratify it. For the now thoroughly
frightened cows started forward in a rush that
would have overborne any animal foolish enough to
try to stem it.

And then Frank did what might have been considered
a foolish thing. Carried away by the enthusiasm
engendered by seeing his plan to stampede
the herd work out successfully, he continued to
bound along behind, at first able to whip the

160

bunched-up stragglers, but soon falling hopelessly
behind as the herd picked up speed and swept forward
like the wind.

Straight toward the clump of trees sheltering
Frankâs friends dashed the reindeer. And an exultant
throb filled his breast. For the hidden enemy
lay in the long grass between the herd and the
trees, and inevitably, therefore, the stampeding animals
would drive them out.

Regardless of the risk to himself, Frank continued
on his way, running as fast as the nature of the
ground permitted. The herd beat the long grass
flat in its advance, as flat as if a great board had
been pressed down on all, and the going was easier
than he had looked for.

Suddenly a shot rang out, then another, and a
little wisp of smoke showed the young fellow the
discharge came from the trees. His own friends
were shooting. At what? Again an exultant thrill
swept over him. He felt certain his friends were
firing at the enemy, and that the stampeding herd
was driving the latter ahead of it, although because
of the presence of the animals between himself and
the enemy he could not see whether such was the
case.

That Frankâs surmise was correct, however, was
soon borne out. For the first shots fired from the

161

trees were succeeded by a rapid rattle that told him
everybody was in action.

Then followed a confused medley of shots interspersed
with shouts and cries, and Frank, pausing a
moment to peer ahead and listen came to the conclusion
that the enemy was desperately shooting at
the reindeer in an effort to turn the herd aside. If
that was the case, however, their efforts were unsuccessful,
for the animals filled with the unreasoning
spirit of panic did not swerve from their course.

âBy golly,â Frank exclaimed aloud, âI believe
I can reach camp all right.â

And once more he began to run forward. For it
seemed to him that the herd, sweeping the enemy
before it, would leave the ground free for him to
reach the clump of trees and rejoin his friends.

On swept the herd, and on ran Frank in the
beaten down grass behind it. His eyes were strained
towards the trees. He began to wave and shout, as
he came closer and made out the outline of Mr.
Hamptonâs tent. He paid no attention to his surroundings.

Then a form rose up from the long grass beside
the swathe beaten down by the reindeer, there was
a shot, and Frank fell forward on his face, a buzzing
in his ears, and lost consciousness.

162
CHAPTER XIX.âLUPOâS END.

When next Frank opened his eyes, he lay on a
blanket in camp and the sight of Bob and Jack bending
anxiously above him while Mr. Hampton and
Farnum worked at his shoulder greeted him.

âHello,â he said, trying to grin, but wincing as a
sharp stab of pain passed through his shoulder.

âDonât move, Frank, Weâll have you fixed up
right in a minute,â said Mr. Hampton soothingly.

âIs it bad, Dad,â Jack anxiously inquired.

âJust grazed the bone,â said Mr. Hampton, putting
the finishing touches to the bandage, and
straightening up. âThere, Frank, now youâll be all
right.â

âWhat happened to me?â asked Frank, struggling
to a sitting position, and finding his right arm
bound across his chest.

âBullet through your shoulder brought you
down,â said Mr. Hampton. âAnd your head struck
a rock hidden in the grass, so you were knocked
out.â

163

âGood enough,â said Frank, âbut who shot me?
I was dashing along, yelling to attract your attention,
and never knew what hit me.â

âI guess you didnât,â said Jack. âIf it hadnât
been for Art, you might have been finished. But
he shot down the fellow that winged you.â

âYes, and your two pals ran out as if there wasnât
an enemy in sight and carried you in,â said Art, as
he saw Frank about to thank him. âGive your
gratitude to them.â

Frank smiled.

âI guess I owe it to you all,â he said.

âYou were foolish to follow the reindeer herd
so closely, Frank,â said Mr. Hampton, reprovingly.
âUnarmed, too.â

âWell, I was stampeding âem, Mr. Hampton,â
said Frank. âI couldnât do that, you know, without
being there.â

The older man shook his head.

âIf I had been myself, Frank, I wouldnât have
let you take that chance,â he said. âNo, Farnum,â
he hastened to add, âIâm not criticizing you. When
these boys take it in their heads to do something itâs
hard to head them off. However, it all turned out
for the best.â

âTell me about it,â Frank said. âHow did my
scheme work out?â

âCouldnât have been better, old thing,â said Bob.

164

âLupoâs men ran like rabbits when those reindeer
swept down on them. They tried a few shots in
an attempt to head them off, but seeing the uselessness
of their efforts, turned and ran. We gave them
a few shots to help them on their way. We counted
nine.â

âAnd they got away?â

âAll but the man Art shot,â said Jack. âThe fellow
who shot at you. And you havenât heard who
he was.â

Jackâs eyes were bright. Frank looked at him
questioningly.

âNotâââ

âYes,â said Jack. âIt was Lupo himself. Art
wounded him in the chest. He died before we
could do anything for him. But Dad got some information
from him first.â

He looked at his father. Mr. Hamptonâs face
was both grim and sad.

âYes, Frank,â he said. âWe learned who set these
men on us, and who plotted against Thorwaldsson.
But let us not discuss it now. Itâs bad business all
the way through.â

Mr. Hampton turned aside, taking Farnum with
him, and the two fell into a low-toned discussion.
Bob and Jack, meanwhile, helped Frank to resume
his clothing which still lay where he had discarded

165

it before taking to the river. Art busied himself at
packing up the camp equipment.

Presently, the two older men called Art to them
and, after a few words of discussion, rejoined the
boys.

âBoys,â said Mr. Hampton, âwe want your
opinions on this, too.â

âOn what, Dad?â

âWell, we saw nine men go bounding off away
from the reindeer, and we accounted for Lupo. That
makes ten, and it doesnât seem likely there were
more. Yet there is the bare possibility that out
there in the grass may be one or more badly
wounded men, fellows whom we shot at one time or
another, who were too hard hit to escape. If there
are any such, we canât go off and leave them there
to die. I wouldnât treat a dog like that.â

âTheyâre not dogs,â muttered Farnum, bitterly.
âTheyâre wolves.â

âMr. Farnum considers we would be taking too
great a risk,â Mr. Hampton continued. âHe says
that if we go out to search for wounded, we are
likely to be shot for our pains.â

âOh, surely not by a wounded man whom you
were going to help,â protested Jack.

âYou donât know them,â said Farnum.

âWell, just the same,â said Jack, âI think Dad is

166

right. It would be shameful for us to go away without
investigating.â

âIâd feel like a murderer,â said Bob. âShooting
âem down in a fight is one thing. It was their lives
or ours. But leaving a wounded man to die in the
wilderness is something entirely different.â

Farnum made a gesture of surrender.

âI guess I seem hard-hearted,â he said. âBut you
donât know what Iâve been through in the past. All
right, weâll make a search. But I warn you to be
on guard.â

âHardly likely after all that there are any
wounded out there,â remarked Frank, taking part
in the discussion for the first time. âThey must
have been in hiding right in the path of the
reindeer, and you canât see any forms there now. If
there were any too badly wounded to escape, theyâd
also have been too badly wounded to drag themselves
to the side.â

Mr. Hampton nodded.

âThe grass is so beaten down, too,â he said, âthat
if there were anybody out there, we could see him.
However, I cannot rest easy without making a
search. Now, you three boys remain in camp and
keep watch. The rest of us will take care of the
search.â

To this the boys made no objection. As a matter
of fact, it was one time that exclusion from activity

167

did not irritate them. They had no stomach for
what they might discover. Frank and Jack, especially,
thinking of the terrible affair on the island in the
lake, kept silence. Bob protested, but more as a
matter of form and because he considered manliness
demanded it, than otherwise.

Mr. Hampton shook his head.

âNone of us want to do this, Bob,â he said. âIt
has to be done, however. But I certainly donât want
you boys along.â

The three men, revolvers clasped in their hands
for use in case of emergency, set out, while the boys
watched from the trees. Keeping close together,
they quartered the plain, going far beyond the
beaten down stretch of grass left by the passing of
the reindeer herd. Presently, the boys saw them
return, and with a sigh of relief, Jack said:

âWell, thank goodness, thatâs over.â

Mr. Hamptonâs spirits were considerably higher
on his return, as the boys could see by his features.

âNobody anywhere,â he reported, âand we made
a thorough search, too.â

âMore thorough than there was need for,â said
Farnum, grumpily.

Mr. Hampton smiled slightly. On long trips into
the wilderness, where men are thrown into intimate
contact every hour of the day and night, they get to
know each other better than would be the case

168

through a lifetime of association under ordinary
circumstances. It was so here. Mr. Hampton had
come to love the silent, capable Farnum. Behind the
latterâs bitter hatred of Lupo and his like, the
easterner knew there was some good reason. He
sensed a tragedy in Farnumâs past, about which, perhaps,
the other would some day speak in a moment
of confidence. And he forgave the manâs seeming
brutality accordingly.

âAll right, everybody,â said Mr. Farnum, cheerily.
âLetâs pack up and be on our way.â

Thanks to Artâs previous preparations, the business
of breaking camp was speedily concluded, and
the party embarked in the canoes and once more got
under way. Farnum and Art both considered that,
because of Frankâs wounded shoulder and his inability
to paddle, Art should take his place in the
canoe with Bob and Jack while Frank went with Mr.
Hampton and Farnum. But to this arrangement the
boys protested vigorously, and Mr. Hampton settled
the matter by supporting them.

âBob and Jack are splendid canoeists,â he said.
âThey have given plenty of evidence of that on this
trip, and at home they are always in the water when
they arenât flying. No, let Frank stay with them.
They donât like to be separated.â

169
CHAPTER XX.âIN THE FOG.

Another period of uneventful canoe travel followed,
corresponding in time to the passage of a day,
although there was nothing to mark the lapse except
the slightly-deepened twilight preceding the reascension
of the sun. Camp was pitched on an
island in the stream which was small and compact
and could be easily defended in case attack on them
was renewed.

Of the latter contingency, however, Mr. Hampton
felt there was little danger. With Lupo gone, the
rascals composing his party would no longer be held
to their purpose, and start to make their way out of
the wilderness and back to their accustomed haunts.

When travel was resumed after an undisturbed
camp, everybody felt rested and in a more cheerful
frame of mind.

âWe ought to be reaching the Coppermine soon,â
Farnum exclaimed, as they set out.

His words were prophetic, because at the end of

170

two hours, on rounding a bend, they discerned not
far ahead a broad and rapid river, into which
emptied the stream they had been following.

âThe Coppermine beyond a doubt,â said Farnum.

In this diagnosis, Mr. Hampton and Art agreed.
And, before long, all question of doubt was conclusively
settled by the discovery of great rocks of
a dull reddish color lining the banks. These were
the copper deposits from which the river took its
name.

âSometime, when the transportation problem has
been solved, this region will be supplying copper to
the world,â Mr. Hampton observed.

The canoe containing the boys was close alongside,
as the older men had let their paddles swing
idly to enable Bob and Jack to catch up with them.

âWhy canât it be taken out now, Dad?â asked
Jack.

âBecause,â explained Mr. Hampton, âthe only
method would be by ship through the Arctic, and
even in the short Summer that is a passage often
blocked by ice. No, development of the copper
resources of this wilderness, as well as of the oil we
hope to find, will have to wait on the building of a
railroad.â

âBut ice and snow will block the railroad.â

âNot nearly to the same extent,â Mr. Hampton
said. âThroughout the Summer, such a road could

171

be in continuous operation. Even in Winter, with
properly designed equipment, the road could be kept
openâperhaps. That, however, is doubtful, for of
the continuous severity of Winter here you boys
can have no conception.â

âWell, if we donât turn back soon, theyâll get some
idea of it, all right,â said Farnum, grimly.

âYou mean weâll be caught by Winter before we
can get out?â asked Mr. Hampton.

âWhen the old North Pole starts sliding south,
she slides fast,â said Farnum, sententiously.

As if spurred by the specter of approaching Winter,
all dug their paddles into the stream with renewed
vigor, and the two canoes swept on between
the dismal, rocky banks hour after hour.

That night there was real twilight, and a sharpness
in the air to which the party was not accustomed.
Art pointed skyward, as he and the boys worked at
building the campfire. Their gaze followed whither
he indicated.

âThe moon,â he said. âSure sign the seasonâs
getting late. Thatâs the first time you could see it
real good.â

âHow late in the Summer is it, anyway?â asked
Frank. âI, for one, have kept no track of time. And
I donât see how anybody else could with the continuous
daylight we have had.â

172

âDad religiously checks off the days every twenty-four
hours,â said Jack. âIâve seen him do it.â

Over the evening meal, Mr. Hampton explained
that from Long Tom, the Indian they had taken
captive on the island in the lake, he had gotten directions
as to where the latter believed Thorwaldsson
and his men to be. The explorer, according to Long
Tom, was making his way along the Coppermine, in
an endeavor to get out to the south before caught by
the Winter. He had started late, and in all likelihood,
Mr. Hamptonâs party was still to the south of
Thorwaldsson.

âFrom now on, however,â said Mr. Hampton,
âwe must keep our eyes open as we proceed for any
signs along the way which would indicate Thorwaldsson
already had passed, going south. Not that
I consider that to be likely, however,â he added.
âOn the contrary, if Long Tom wasnât lying, and I
believe he was telling the truth, Thorwaldsson
should be close at hand, and we ought soon to encounter
him.â

Camp again was uneventful, but when the boys
awoke in the morning they found a thick wet fog
over all. Their blankets were wet with it, the rocks
were wet, and the river which had lain spread out
before them under the moonlight when they turned
in for the night, now could not be seen. Only a
gray wall of fog greeted them, blurring the outlines

173

even of Mr. Hampton, Farnum and Art, who stood
in anxious conversation.

When the boys joined their elders, they found the
question up for discussion was the question of
whether to proceed or remain where they were until
the fog lifted.

âWeâve had unexampled good weather so far,
Mr. Hampton,â said Farnum. âBut this fog may
mark the breaking-up. We may be in for it from
now on.â

âI realize all that,â Mr. Hampton said, his slight
impatience mute evidence to Jack, at least, that his
Father was worried. âWhat Iâd like to know now,
is whether to move on or wait till the fog lifts.â

âWhy not move on, Dad?â asked Jack.

âOh, you boys up, hey? Well, for one thing, if
we travel in this fog we run the danger of being
caught in rapids and sucked forward before being
able to reach the bank. For another, we mightâjust
mightâpass Thorwaldsson, in the fog, without
knowing it. He might be traveling, too.â

After some further discussion, it was decided the
party should remain until the fog lifted, and that
all should be on guard to catch any sound of movement
out of the fog which would indicate somebody,
presumably Thorwaldsson, was passing. Following
breakfast, in fact, all but Mr. Hampton, who remained
in camp, as a guide in case the others blundered and

174

lost their way in the fog, took up positions
along the bank of the river, some twenty yards apart
to maintain âlistening posts.â

An hour passed, and then another, with no indication
that the fog was thinning out, and with no
sound coming to straining ears except the lap of the
water along the rocks at their feet. It was nerve-trying
work in a way, to sit there for so long a
period, isolated, as if entirely alone in an unpeopled
world. The boys, at their various stations, felt the
strain considerably, more so, indeed, than did
Farnum or Art who were old hands at the wilderness
game.

In assigning all their stations, Mr. Hampton had
decided, because of the greater experience of the two
older men, that they should take up their positions
at the south end of the line. If any party south-bound
along the Coppermine escaped the attention of
the boys, Farnum and Art would be pretty likely to
remedy the oversight.

To Bob fell the most northerly position. And, as
he sat there, hunched up on a rock, staring out into
that thick greasy wall of mist, he felt, if anything,
more lonely than his companions. Jack and Frank,
at least, had the consolation of knowing there was
someone to either side. But, with none of his
friends beyond him on the north, Bob felt very much
alone, indeed.

175

All sorts of reflections entered his mind, reflections
that had no bearing whatsoever on the situation
in which he found himself. He thought of sunny
days on Long Island, of flights in his airplanes or
zipping trips along the coast in his speed boat. He
thought of one thing and another, classroom, Mexican
mountains, that strange city of another world
found immured in the Andes, andâof Marjorie.
Ever since his first meeting with his sisterâs friend,
Miss Faulkner, she had occupied a position of growing
importance in Bobâs scheme of things. Somedayââ

âSome girl,â Bob said to himself. âIâll have to
see more of her.â

He leaned forward, elbows planted on his knees,
eyes staring into the fog. In reality, his thoughts,
as can be seen, were far, far away. But presently,
a sound, muffled and faint, pierced his consciousness
and he sprang into instant alertness. He listened,
holding his breath, straining to hear.

It came again.

Bob started on a stumbling run for Jack, the first
man to the south.

176
CHAPTER XXI.âA WAILING CRY.

âJack, Jack,â he shouted, as he ran through the
fog, blindly, but remembering to veer away from the
river bank a little to avoid the danger of tumbling
in. âJack, Jack, where are you?â

A shadow, fog-distorted, loomed before him, big,
enormous. A hand gripped his shoulder and
brought him to a halt.

âHere I am, Bob. Whatâs the matter?â

Bob rubbed the back of a big hand across his eyes.

âI heard something out there,â he said, pointing
into the fog upon the river. âI guess Iâd been asleep,
or daydreaming, anyway. I couldnât be sure I had
heard anything. It came twiceâthat sound. Then
there was silence. So I came down here to ask
whether you had heard, too.â

âBut, Bob, what was it? What did you hear? I
heard nothing.â

âJack, it was the sound of a babyâs cry.â

Bobâs voice was solemn. A shiver ran through

177

Jack, as if a breath of cold air had fanned him. In
that fog-enwrapped isolation, in that far northern
wilderness, what could a baby be doing? It was
preposterous. More, it was uncanny.

âBob, you were asleep. Yes, sir, you certainly
were dreaming. A baby. Huh.â

âMaybe so,â Bob said, reluctantly. âBut, true
as I live, Jackâââ

The otherâs grip on his shoulder tightened.

Out of the fog came a wailing sound, distant, thin,
but unmistakable. It was the cry of a baby, if ever
there was such a thing.

But this time it came not from the river, but from
inland. The two listened, straining to hear, but the
cry died away without being repeated. They looked
at each other, an unnamable fear gripping them.

âJack, Iâm afraid,â confessed Bob in a whisper.
âI donât knowâthereâs something strikes a chill into
meâIâIâââ

He paused. Jack nodded.

âI feel the same way, Bob,â he said, low-voiced.
âWhat a pair of fools we are, though,â he added,
brightening. âThat must be some bird, or animal,
perhaps.â

Almost unconsciously, they had been making their
way southward and now another figure rose up in
the fog before themâthat of Frank. He was about
to speak, when once more the wailing cry rose, and

178

this time it came from two quarters, from the river
and from farther inland. The three stood, silent,
speechless, and in that moment, while the echoes of
the cries still rang in their heads, Farnum and Art
materialized out of the fog.

âGood, there you all are,â said Farnum, in a low,
tense voice. âFollow me to camp.â

And without a word of explanation he started
at right angles away from the river, for they had
taken their stations in such fashion that Frank, holding
the middle position, would be directly opposite
the camp. This was in order to enable them to reach
it without losing their way in the fog.

âWhat is it, Art?â asked Jack, his voice matching
Farnumâs.

âIndians,â answered Art, tersely. âStick close
together and donât make no noise.â

It was a situation to tax the nerve of the bravest,
and the three boys hurrying along in the wake of
Farnum and Art could not be accused of cowardice
for experiencing a chill premonition of trouble ahead.
Often had Farnum spoken of the cruelty of these far
northern Indians. Bitter had been their experiences
with Lupoâs half-breeds, in whose veins flowed the
blood of the Indians of the north.

As they hurried along, there flashed through their
minds some of the stories Farnum had told. Had
they gotten so far, so near the end of their quest for

179

the âLost Expeditionâ only to be wiped out by
Indians, on the very eve of success? Such thoughts
raced through the mind of each. But they were
determined fellows, accustomed to confront danger,
used to tight places. The first onrush of panic was
swept aside, and, by the time they tumbled into the
little hollow in which camp had been pitched, and
where Mr. Hampton awaited them, each had himself
well in hand.

Mr. Hampton looked at their determined faces,
and a smile of grim approval was his greeting.

âIndians, boys,â he said. âFarnum told me. I
suspected as much. Now, we have no trees here for
bulwark, but this little hollow is good enough. Let
us lie down and line the edge of the pit. Weâll be
pretty close together, and if any Indians stumble on
us theyâll get a warm reception. Listen.â He spoke
in a low voice. âThere goes that cry again. Does
it sound closer? Yes,â as the other nodded, âI
thought so. Quick. Take your positions. Jack,
my boy, you stay beside me.â

There was a little tremor in his voice. That was
all. But Jack understood. He clasped his fatherâs
hand strongly, then threw himself prone beside him,
while the others ranged themselves in a circle as
commanded.

Once more came the wailing cry from the inland.
Once more it was answered in kind from the water.

180

But to all it was apparent that the sounds were
farther removed, and Mr. Hampton broke the painful
silence with a whispered:

âTheyâre moving on, moving away.â

âLook, Dad,â Jack exclaimed excitedly. âI can
see those rocks ahead where a minute ago was only
the white fog. Why, the fogâs lifting. Itâs lifting,
Dad, sure enough.â

âYouâre right, Jack,â his father replied, low-voiced,
but there was anxiety rather than jubilation
in his tone. âThat will make it bad for us. Weâll
be exposed to sight.â

Once again came the wail, faint and far away. As
faint came the reply from the water. Both cries
were to the north. Originally they had come from
that direction. Now they were withdrawing whence
they had come. What could it mean?

The next minute a rattle of rifle fire broke the
silence. At the same time a cold breeze blew across
the crouching figures in the shallow pit and the fog
began to shred out fast before it.

Farnum sprang upright, gazing to the north. The
others also gained their feet. The shooting now
was fast and furious.

âI canât understand,â said Farnum, in a puzzled
tone.

With an exclamation, Jack seized his fatherâs
arm.

181

âDad,â he cried, âyou said Thorwaldsson might
be near.â

âYes, whyââ

âThatâs it,â said Art, in a tone of conviction.
Mr. Farnum turned towards him.

âYou mean?â

âJack guessed it. Thorwaldssonâs being attacked.â

Jack nodded.

âThatâs what I meant, Dad.â

âYouâre right, Jack,â said his father. âCome on.
It canât be anything else. Nobody but Thorwaldsson
is in this wilderness. We must help him. Stick
close together.â

And scrambling out of their shallow pit, Mr.
Hampton started on the dead run towards the direction
of the shooting, with the others at his heels.

The ground was bare of verdure, and great rocks
of the copper ore were scattered around. On this
account their view was restricted, but the sound of
the rifle fire grew momentarily louder, apprising
them that they were nearing the scene of conflict.
Suddenly Bob, who was in the lead, having out-distanced
the others several yards, rounded a big
rock and found himself on a bank above a narrow
strip of beach.

Below lay a number of forms, as of men dead
or wounded. Two canoes were drawn up on the
beach, and behind one of these, using it as a bulwark,

182

crouched a man, rifle to shoulder. Farther
down the beach were three other canoes grounded,
and beside them several forms of wounded men, and
five or six men, crouching, firing at the lone defender
of the attacked position, creeping up on him.

Just as Bob reached the edge of the bank, the
attackers mustered up courage for a rush, and with
wild shouts swept forward. It looked dark, indeed,
for the lone defender of the upturned canoes.
Bob looked back to see how close were his companions,
but they were not yet in sight. His dash
had carried him farther than he had believed to be
the case.

It had taken only a glance to show Bob which way
the land lay. The lone defender was the survivor of
Thorwaldssonâs party, if the explorerâs party it was,
of which Bob had little doubt. He was a white
man. The others were half-breeds, and if Bob was
not mistaken they were of the same gang which he
had encountered before.

It was distinctly up to him to lend a hand. Throwing
his rifle to his shoulder, he prepared to open fire
on the crushing enemy. But as his finger pressed
the trigger, he groaned. The mechanism of the rifle
had became jammed in some fashion. Desperately
he worked to release the trigger, but to no avail.

Then the light of battle came into big Bobâs eyes.
The half-breeds were just below him now. Several

183

of their number had fallen in the rush, shot down
by the defender of the canoes. Four were left, and
they evidently were bent on polishing off their lone
opponent. So absorbed were all in their own drama,
they had not seen Bob.

Clubbing his rifle, Bob leaped. He came down on
the back of one of the attackers, and bore him to the
ground. With catlike swiftness, Bob, who himself
had fallen on his hands and knees, gathered himself
together, regained his feet, and swinging his clubbed
rifle, let out a yell fit to âfrighten a wolf pack,â as
Frank later described it.

The stock of the rifle came down with a thud on
the shoulders of another of the half-breeds, felling
him as if he had been struck by lightning. So
tremendous was the blow, that it tore the rifle from
Bobâs grasp. But he leaped for another of the
enemy, a fellow whose startled face was close to his,
seized him about the waist and whirled him aloft to
be tossed aside as if he were a sack of meal. The
fourth man was dropped by a shot from the defender
of the canoe.

âAttaboy, Bob,â came Frankâs voice, from the
bluff above.

One after the other, Bobâs friends leaped to the
beach.

As Frank and Jack clapped him on the back, and

184

tried to grasp his hand, uttering enthusiastic praise
the while, Bob looked around.

âSay, whereâs that chap? Why, heâs fainted.â

Freeing himself from his companionsâ clutches,
Bob leaped over the up-ended canoe and bent above
the recumbent body of the doughty defender.

âWhy, heâs badly wounded,â he cried.

Mr. Hampton pushed him aside.

âHere, let me look, Bob,â he said. âYou fellows
help Farnum and Art in looking after the others.
The place is a shambles, with wounded men everywhere.â

185
CHAPTER XXII.âOUTWARD BOUND.

It was a week before the wounded could be
moved. At close range though the fight had been,
none had been killed. When the boys exclaimed in
amazement at this, Art shrugged his shoulders.

âMore bullets fly in a fight than ever reach their
mark,â he said. âIâve seen men, tough fellows,
regular two-gun men, shoot at each other in Alaskan
saloons in the old days without anybody being
killed. When a man sees red, he donât take no good
aim.â

The majority of the wounded were not hit in vital
spots, but Thorwaldsson had been shot in so many
places that his recovery at first was a matter of
doubt. It was he who had been the last of his party
to keep firing, he whom Bob had rescued in the nick
of time.

From Farrell and others of Thorwaldssonâs five
companions, however, the story of what had occurred
had been obtained. They had been on their way

186

down the Coppermine when they, too, had been overtaken
in the fog. They had landed in the little beach
to wait for the fog to lift. There the half-breeds,
survivorâs of Lupoâs gang, who had been dogging
the trail of Mr. Hampton and his party, had come
upon them.

The surprise had been mutual, for the half-breeds
had been looking for the Hampton party and not for
Thorwaldsson. However, they had attacked, the
majority from the canoes, and three who had been
scouting along shore, from the land. Surprised thus,
Thorwaldssonâs party had put up a game fight, but
one after the other had been shot down until only
the leader was left. He, barricaded behind the
canoes, had held off the rest of the attackers until
the final rush and Bobâs timely arrival.

As the days passed by, with the twilight deepening
into short nights, Art and Farnum both grew
increasingly anxious to be on their way for the outside.
They knew their North, and they realized
that the time remaining to them before Winter set
in was narrowing down to a perilously small edge.

âWeâll have a mighty hard job of it, Mr. Hampton,â
Farnum pleaded. âWhat with wounded on
our hands, and prisoners to guard, it looks almost
hopeless as it is for us to get out. But, anyway, we
canât afford to waste time. Canât Thorwaldsson be
moved? Heâll be all right in a canoe.â

187

âAs long as the traveling is easy, yes,â said Mr.
Hampton. âHe will be all right. But how about
at the portages? Heâs lost lot of blood already. He
canât afford to lose any more. However, I expect
that with care we can prevent his wounds from reopening.
Weâll start tomorrow.â

Accordingly, on the day appointed, camp was
broken, and the party got under way. Frankâs
shoulder was healed sufficiently to permit him once
more to wield a paddle, although still a trifle stiff,
and he took his place in the canoe with Bob and
Jack. They had another passenger this time in Farrell,
whose right arm had been broken by a shot in
the sanguinary fight on the river beach. Thorwaldsson
was taken in the canoe occupied by Mr. Hampton
and Farnum, Art going in one of the other craft
with members of Thorwaldssonâs party. Several
of the latter had been creased by rifle bullets and
one shot through a leg, but all could wield paddles.

And so the long trip out of the wilderness began,
with the half-breeds in three canoes, deprived of
arms and closely watched by their captors in the four
canoes bringing up the rear. With reasonable care,
it was felt, the prisoners could be controlled until
they should near civilization. Without weapons they
would be in a hopeless plight in the wilderness, unable
to defend themselves against wild animals, unable
to provide food for themselves. Therefore, no

188

attempt on the part of their captives to escape was
looked for by the others, until they should near the
outlying settlements of the inhabited country.

âWhen that time comes,â Mr. Hampton had
warned the boys, âwe must be on the lookout, for
the half-breeds, unless closely watched, will try to
get back their weapons and make a break for it. And
I am determined to take them into civilization as
witnesses to prove my statement of the murderous
conspiracy against us on the part of an eminent gentleman
in faraway New York.â

Mr. Hampton spoke bitterly, for from all that had
occurred and from the accounts, first of Long Tom
and of the dying Lupo, and again of Farrell and the
surviving members of Thorwaldssonâs party, he had
pieced together the story of the conspiracy against
them.

To the boys he confided this tale, the main theme
of which was that when Farrell had told his story to
Mr. Otto Anderson concerning the discovery of the
oil-bearing region in the Arctic, Mr. Andersonâs
confidential secretary had gone to a New York financier
and sold him the information. He had not been
able to tell definitely, however, the location of the
oil region, for the very good reason, as before related,
that Farrell was not certain of it himself, his
vicissitudes in getting out of the country having unsettled
his mind. Therefore, this financier had sent

189

his agents westward with word that Thorwaldsson
be tracked.

âPerhaps this financier, Old Grimm, ordered the
mere tracking of Thorwaldsson,â said Mr. Hampton.
âBut I doubt it. The attacks on Thorwaldssonâs
expedition, the disappearance of his ship and
crew, all look like parts of a deep-laid plan to attain
Grimmâs ends at whatever cost in human life. And,
on top of it all, the attack on us by Lupo, who was
paid a handsome sum down in Dawson by Andersonâs
former secretary, acting as agent for Grimm,
show the latter aimed to put us all out of the way.â

âAnd all for money,â said Jack. âItâs hard to
believe.â

âAh, you donât know Grimm,â said his father.
âThe man who develops this Arctic oil region may
become the richest in the world. Grimm is ambitious
for that position. Heâs got a lot of money so
far, in one crooked way or another. But heâs not
one of the big ones yet, not one of the richest. And
he wants to be supreme. Well, he has overreached
himself this time, for Iâve got the evidence,
and Iâll see that we get more in Dawson and Seattle
and New York. Mr. Grimm will no longer have
the power or freedom to toy with menâs lives when
I get through with him.â

Although Thorwaldsson lay as in a stupor and
could not be questioned, the full account of what had

190

befallen his expedition since it set out from Seattle
was learned from the others. First of all, they had
succeeded in retracing Farrellâs earlier footsteps,
and had found the oil region and the river running
through it. A thorough survey of the country had
been made, with maps showing the outlet by water
to the Arctic Ocean.

In fact, the party had made its way out the river
into the Arctic Ocean and around the coast into the
Coppermine. There they had encountered and made
friends with a tribe of Eskimo. They had started
down the Coppermine, or rather up, as it flows north
into the Arctic, but had been attacked, losing half
the members of their party and a large part of their
equipment, including the radio. It was after this
that the aviator of the expedition had attempted to
fly to the outside with news of Thorwaldssonâs
plight, the latter meanwhile being cared for through
the following Winter by the friendly Eskimo at the
mouth of the Coppermine, to which they had put
back. The death of the aviator, near the MacKenzie,
of course, was not known to the Thorwaldsson
party until the news was imparted by the boys.

The course followed as they struck southward was
not that pursued by Farrell when he had made his
way back to civilization. On that occasion he had
frequently been light-headed, and it was felt it
would be unwise to trust now to his guidance. Instead,

191

Mr. Hampton and Farnum decided to retrace
their own trail back to the island in the lake where
MacDonald had been encountered, and thence follow
his course to the Fort of the Northwest Mounted
Police.

Day after day they pushed ahead, the nights ever
growing longer and colder, with frost on the ground
in the mornings. The honking of the wild geese
overhead, as they made their way south, also was a
warning that the mantle of Winter soon would settle
down.

âYou see,â Art said to the boys one day, âWinter
in this country not only means dreadful cold for
which we ainât prepared in the matter of clothing
or snowshoes or nothing, but also it means there
ainât no food to be had. Yes, thereâs plenty of game
now, geese and duck everywhere along the streams,
caribou plentiful. But you notice theyâre all going
south. When Winter strikes, thereâll be nothing in
this wilderness but rabbit and beaver. Beaverâs all
rightâif you can dig âem out oâ their huts. But
rabbitâhuh! Well, you can starve fine on rabbit.â

192
CHAPTER XXIII.âLONG JIM APPEARS.

Winter, after all, caught them in its icy grip far
north of where they had planned to be when the cold
should really set in. This was due to a variety of
circumstances. The slowness of Thorwaldssonâs recovery
was one of the retarding influences, which
prevented them making the desired speed. After
weeks of travel he was still in a comatose condition,
and Mr. Hampton feared his brain had been affected
by a bullet that ploughed along the left side of his
head. The other wounded, although quick to recover,
also acted as a hindrance, especially at the
first.

Then, too, the season was unusual. Winter arrived
weeks ahead of the expected time. And daily,
as the ice on stream and river thickened, it became
increasingly hard to break a way. Yet the canoes
could not be abandoned, for, once snow began to
fly, the travelers would have been helpless on land,
without sleds or snowshoes. Sleds of a sort could

193

be constructed, of course, and makeshift snowshoes
made, too, but neither would be worth much, and
the manufacture of them would take a good deal of
time.

Two sentries were always posted at night now;
one by a fire around which slumbered the prisoners,
the other by a fire in the midst of a circle composed
of the Hampton and Thorwaldsson parties combined.
It was Jackâs turn to keep guard one cold
but clear night, after a heavy snowfall, which had
caused a great deal of suffering to all, and had
brought them, indeed, to the verge of despair. For
they were insufficiently clad, even though the skins
of many animals slain for food in the past weeks
had been saved and roughly cured for wraps; and,
in addition, with the closing-in of Winter game had
become so scarce that the camp was virtually on the
verge of starvation.

Jack was mounting guard by the fire around which
lay his friends. One of the Thorwaldsson party,
Swenson, did sentry duty by the other fire. Looking
across the little space which separated the two
parties, Jack could see the huddled figures of the
half-breeds lying so close to the fire, which Swenson
fed constantly with fuel, that they seemed almost
to be in it. Around him the members of his
own party were similarly disposed.

With a sigh, Jack arose, caught up an armful of

194

wood and tossed it into the fire. The flames at once
shot high and, as if that were a signal, out of the
darkness beyond came a robust hail.

âHello, there. Keep âer goinâ, sonny.â

Into the light of the fire a moment later strode a
big fur-clad figure of a man on snowshoes. On his
back was a pack which he dropped to the ground
with a sigh of relief. Then he leaned his rifle in
the crook of an elbow and, pulling off great fur mittens,
spread his hands to the blaze, working his fingers
gratefully back and forth.

âCold anâ gittinâ colder,â he announced, casually.
âGot a nice fire here.â

Jack was nonplussed. In the first place, to find
another wanderer in this wilderness which they believed
unpeopled was exciting enough. But to
have him walk in casually and without vouchsafing
any explanation of his presence took Jackâs
breath away for the moment. Yet Jack knew enough
of the woodland lore to realize that hospitality is
the first law of the wilds, and that questions distinctly
would not be in order. He decided the best
thing for him would be to wait for the other to take
the lead in the conversation.

This the intruder was not slow to do, beginning
even as he eased his stiffened fingers in the warmth
of the fire.

195

âDidnât know there was anybody else in this
country,â he said. âBeen around here long?â

A look of clumsy craft from under shaggy brows
accompanied the question. Jack had to smile to himself.

âNo; not long,â he said composedly. âAnd you?â

âOh, I been huntinâ anâ trappinâ âround here,â the
other said.

To Jack it seemed the man was an honest enough,
even a likeable, type, and yet that he was acting
evasively. He decided it would be a good plan to
get a more experienced head to help him deal with
the situation. None of his party apparently was
awake, all being worn out with the terrific strain
of the dayâs travel. But Art lay near him. In fact,
his foot was not six inches from Jack.

Unostentatiously, in order not to attract the newcomerâs
attention, Jack moved his foot to a position
where with his toe he could tap on Artâs ankles. It
was sufficient for the purpose apparently, for, out
of the tail of his eye Jack saw Artâs body stiffen
and his head lift up slightly from the ground. For
what followed, however, he was totally unprepared.

Art sprang to his feet, leaped forward and began
thumping the newcomer vigorously on the back.

âWhy, you olâ son-of-a-gun,â he cried. âYou olâ
son-of-a-gun.â

196

âLiâl Artie, or Iâm goinâ blind,â cried the other,
seizing Art by the hand and pumping up and down.

Jack turned in amazement to Art.

âWhyâwhyâyou know each other!â he cried.

âKnow each other? Har, har, har,â roared the
giant, in a guffaw that aroused the others about the
campfire. âKnow each other? Thatâs a good one.â

Mr. Hampton, Farnum, Bob and Frank, Farrell
and several of the others gathered around, looking
their questions, and Art turned to satisfy them.

âEver hear oâ Long Jim Golden?â he asked.
âWell, this is himâthe daggonedest trapper on the
face oâ the earth. Ainât seen him in years since he
left Circle City in the rush. Where you been, Jim?â

âTrappinâ.â Jim looked around at the interested
faces. âYou tolâ who I am,â he said. âNow
tell me whoâs your friends, Artie.â

âSure,â said Art heartily, effecting introductions.
âHere we all are,â he concluded, and then his face
fell as he added: âbut where weâll be soon, I donât
know, nor whatâs to become of us.â

Long Jim looked first at one, then at another,
then his eyes roved over the camp.

âHow come?â he asked. âNo sleds nor dogs nor
snowshoes nor nothinâ. How come?â

âSit here by the fire and Iâll tell you, Jim,â said
Art. âThe rest oâ you, we wonât bother you none

197

with loud voices. Weâll jest whisper-like. Youâll
want to turn in and sleep, so go to it.â

Nothing loath, the others with the exception of
Jack, who moved to one side so as not to intrude
on the two old acquaintances thus strangely reunited,
turned in and soon were once more asleep.

Briefly as possible, Art explained to Long Jim
the circumstances leading up to their present position.
From across the fire, Jack watched them. He
saw that Long Jim paid close attention to Artâs narrative
and that, indeed, it seemed to affect him
strangely. For over his open, rugged features, not
constructed to conceal their ownerâs moods, swept
doubt, uncertainty, indecision, as if within the man
was going on a fight between two contending forces.
Jack was puzzled. What could Long Jim be thinking
of?

Then Long Jim slowly rose to his feet, placing a
hand on the shoulder of his companion who remained
seated but looking up at him. Jack unconsciously
moved closer as the big trapper appeared about to
speak. He did not want to eavesdrop, but Long
Jimâs expression had puzzled him greatly. What
could it mean?

âArtie,â said Long Jim in a louder tone than that
in which their whispered conversation had been carried
on, and one that reached Jackâs ears, âArtie, my

198

boy,â he said, âI wish you didnât have them skunks
with ye.â

âThem breeds,â said Art, jerking a thumb back
over a shoulder to indicate the prisoners sleeping
about the other fire.

âThem same,â said Long Jim. âCause why, you
asks me? Cause I got a paradise to take you all to,
where you can spend the Winter lapped in comfort.
Anâ I donât want to take no rascals like them half-breeds
there. Butâââ

Art was on his feet, excitement struggling with
disbelief.

âWhat? What you mean, Long Jim?â

âJest what I says,â answered the other emphatically.
âA paradise, I calls it. Anâ a paradise it
is. Anâ the quicker we git there the better, so wake
up your friends anâ let me talk to âem. If we have
to take them skunks, why, weâll take âem.â

199
CHAPTER XXIV.âA TALE OF PARADISE.

At the insistence of Long Jim, Art and Jack, who
had been called to join the pair, speedily re-aroused
their friends.

âI ainât no hand for talkinâ,â Long Jim declared
in answer to Artâs requests for further information.
âI got to tell this. But onct oughter be enough.
No use my tellinâ you anâ then tellinâ the rest oâ
them all over agin.â

Jack smiled discreetly. Long Jim claimed he was
âno hand for talking,â yet his tongue wagged continually.
However, his heart seemed in the right
place, and certainly he spoke emphatically enough
of a haven not too far away to which they could
go for refuge. What was it he called it? âParadise.â
Jack was anxious to hear, and wasted no time on
gentle methods in arousing the sleepers.

âLookit here,â said Long Jim, as the circle gathered
around him. âArtâs been tellinâ me the trouble
you folks is in. Looks to me like you moughtnât
be able to make it out oâ this country.â

200

Mr. Hampton nodded grave confirmation.

âWell, I know of a place thatâs paradise,â said
Long Jim, impressively. âAnâ Iâll take ye all there,
anâ ye can spend the Winterâwarm, game, everything
there. Only thing, like I tolâ Artie here, is I
hate to have to take them skunks oâ half-breeds in
there. Theyâll be a-cominâ back later anâ ruin the
country.â

âBut I donât understand,â said Mr. Hampton.
âWhat is it you are talking about?â

âDonât blame ye,â said Long Jim. âThink maybe
the olâ manâs crazy, donât ye? Donât blame ye for
that, neither. But, look here, nightâs dyinâ anâ if
ye stand up anâ look where Iâm pointinâ yeâll see
somethinâ.â

Mr. Hampton arose wonderingly, and the others
also stood up.

âThar,â said Long Jim, stretching an arm to the
westward. âWhat dâye see?â

âWhyâa great bank of fog,â said Mr. Hampton,
after gazing intently. âHow strange. Fog in
Winter. I donât understand.â

âAnâ ye all think thatâs fog, hey?â asked Long
Jim, turning to the others.

Nodding heads answered.

âWell, it ainât,â he said. âThatâs the vapor from
hot springs.â

201

âHot springs?â Mr. Hampton sounded frankly
incredulous.

âWaitâll you see for yourself,â said Long Jim,
tolerantly. âI wouldnât believe it, neither, when I
first saw it. I thought it was fog, too. But beinâ
as how heavy fog in the Winter were strange, I
went to investigate. Anâ I found paradise.â

Then, under Mr. Hamptonâs skillful questioning,
Long Jim told his story. He declared he had lived
in this region now these two years, and that since
first arriving he had seen nobody except themselves.
Drawn by the seeming fog to investigate, he had
come upon an almost tropical valley through which
ran not only one but several rivers of water forever
at the boiling point. These rivers, moreover, he said,
were fed by hundreds of hot springs, which bubbled
out of the ground in all directions. It was the steam
from these which, condensing as it rose above the
valley and struck the cold Winter air, had formed
the fog which first attracted his attention.

âOnce I were in South America,â said Long Jim.
âDown clost to the Equator. Well, Iâm tellinâ you,
it were that hot all last Summer right in that valley.
As for right now, yeâll find it mighty pleasant anâ
warm, anâ when snow falls itâs only rain by the
time it passes through the heat hanginâ over that
valley all the time.â

âHurray,â cried Frank, exuberantly. âLetâs go.

202

No snow fellows. Get that? Iâve had all the snow
I need for one season, anyway, and I guess I can get
along without any more for some time to come.â

Mr. Hampton smiled, but, disregarding Frankâs
jubilation, proceeded with his questioning. And
Long Jim, delighted with an audience to which he
could talk all he pleased, after having been without
companions for several years, continued unfolding
new wonders.

This valley, he declared, was about 200 miles
long and 40 miles wide. They were now near its
upper end, to which point Long Jim had made his
way by slow travel and exploration during the two
years since his arrival at the southern end.

Game?

At the question, Long Jim grew even more
eloquent.

He declared that, due to the heat generated by
the hot springs and the boiling rivers, the fertility
of the soil was amazing. The vegetation, in fact,
achieved a jungle growth. Wild rose bushes grew
tall as trees, with stems as thick as a manâs forearm
and so dense that it was impossible to force a way
through them. Willows grew to the size of big
trees, with branches so thick it was possible to walk
along them.

âAnâ birches,â added Long Jim, âgit to be hunderds
oâ feet tall, so tall, in fact, they canât hold

203

themselves up but bend over anâ touch the ground.

âLikely you think Iâm out oâ my head. Oh, I kin
see it in your eyes. But Iâm tellinâ you the Godâs
truth, men.â And Long Jim spoke with such honest
sincerity, they were compelled to believe him. âIn
sich a place,â he continued, âit ainât likely there
wouldnât be no game. Why, the animals there is
thick as flees on a olâ hound.

âMountain sheep, goats, caribou, moose, bear,
deer, wolves, foxes, oh, every wild animal oâ the
whole North kin be found thereâdown in that
valley anâ in the mountains enclosinâ of it. Anâ I tell
you the truth,â he concluded, his voice sinking for
effect, âthe moose git so fat theyâre almost square
anâ theyâre so darn tame ye can almost touch âem.â

As Long Jimâs speech came to a halt, Mr. Hampton
turned and stared across the brightening landscape
to the distant bank of vapor. Soon the short
days would end entirely, and the perpetual night of
the Arctic would arrive. Only a miracle could save
them from perishing, all unprepared to face further
travel as they were. Could it be possible that miracle
had occurred, and that this trapper was telling the
truth?

Jack looked at his father, and sensed what was
passing through the older manâs mind. Truth to
tell, some such thoughts were in his own. He went
up to him and laid a hand across his shoulders.

204

âCome on, Dad,â he said. âI believe Long Jim
is telling the truth. And we better make the effort
to get to this valley. He may be exaggerating a
little, but certainly it looks like a promised land.â

âThatâs right, Jack,â said his father, shaking off
his reverie, and his alert self once more. âWeâll
have a hard enough struggle getting there, what
with having to cross this waste of new-fallen snow
without snowshoes or sleds. Well, letâs see what
can be done.â

Eventually, the party got into motion. The
canoes were cached, where they could be recovered
in the Summer. There was little likelihood anybody
else would pass that way, to appropriate them.
Equipment was made into packs shouldered by
everybody except Art and Bob. These two were
to carry Thorwaldsson on a stretcher, improvised
out of poles cut on the river bank, and blankets.

Fortunately, the crest of the valley to which
Long Jim was guiding them was distant not more
than five or six miles. Even at that, however, the
going was tremendously difficult because of the mass
of new-fallen snow. Had it not been for Long Jim
to break the way on his snowshoes, moreover, it is
doubtful whether they could have made it, heavy
laden as they were. But Long Jim worked patiently
backward and forward, breaking down the snow,

205

and packing it a second and even a third time with
his webs.

âHow come you were out here, olâ timer?â asked
Art once, as Long Jim paused, and he caught up
with him.

âWell, I git lonesome a leetle,â said Long Jim.
âI was prospectinâ around in the mountains rimminâ
the valley yestiddy, anâ I saw you across the snow.
Jest leetle specks you were, but agin the snow I
thought you were humans. I couldnât hardly believe
my eyes, but I come along investigatinâ. Anâ then
when night come on, you lit your fires, anââââ

âSure was lucky for us, Long Jim, if you ainât
a-lyinâ,â said Art.

Long Jim stiffened, and for a moment was
prepared to stand on his dignity but then he smiled
in a jolly way that sent crinkly wrinkles all around
his blue eyes.

âDonât blame ye for that, Artie,â he said. âSounds
like I were crazy, donât it? But jest wait till you
see.â

206
CHAPTER XXV.âVOICES FROM THE WILDERNESS.

But Long Jim had not falsified. The valley
proved, indeed, to be more even than he described,
for as the world now knows important mineral deposits
were discovered, including gold, silver, copper,
coal, iron and oil. But of the development
going on to bring not only this marvelous region
but the vast oil region beyond the Coppermine into
the worldâs resources naught need be said now.
Suffice it to say that such development is under way,
for Mr. Hampton had the ear of the great financiers,
and was able to bring it about; and also that Farrell
and Long Jim are receiving handsome incomes from
their shares in the various projects.

Here the party settled down, constructed huts,
and prepared to await the coming of Spring when the
snow should disappear from the vast wilderness
separating them from the northern edge of the
civilized lands and the ice in the rivers be unlocked.

One of the first things done by the boys was to

207

erect their radio plant, and they succeeded without
much difficulty in opening communication with the
little Fort of the Northwest Mounted Police on the
farthest rim of the settled country. MacDonald and
Dick, with their prisoners, had arrived only a day or
two before communication was opened, and the two
parties exchanged the stories of their adventures
by radio.

To Long Jim the radio was as great a source of
wonder as Long Jimâs valley was to the boys. He
could never get over marveling at it, and every time
that it was brought into use, Long Jim, if he were
in the vicinity, was on hand, sitting in rapt and
open-mouthed astonishment while the boys operated
the instruments.

Much time was spent in exploring this wonderful
valley, at the resources of which Mr. Hampton
could never express sufficient astonishment.

âIt is a freak of nature, of course, boys,â he explained
on one occasion.

âHow wonderful that it should have remained
undiscovered for so long,â said Jack.

âNot so marvelous,â said his father. âFew, indeed,
are the people who ever have penetrated any
distance into all this vast wilderness of northern
Canada. It was supposed, and still is generally supposed,
to be bleak and uninhabitable. You know
from experience that the contrary is the case. It

208

is delightful country in Summer, and man is so constituted
that, if properly clothed and housed, he can
stand any severity of Winter. Some day, I predict,
all this vast wilderness through which we have been
making our way will be settled. That day is far off,
of course, but it is coming. The growth of world
population will force the conquest of the sub-Arctic.â

The one thing making their stay in this valley of
marvels unpleasant was the constant rainfall. For
in the Arctic storm succeeds storm, sweeping down
from the North Pole in never-ending succession.
And these storms which they knew were burying the
land beyond the valley under a pall of ice and snow
poured torrents of water on them. The peaks of
the mountain ranges rimming the valley were buried
under snow, gleaming wan in the occasional moonlight
between the storms, for by now the long night
had come. But on them no snow fell, for as Long
Jim had foretold the snow as it passed through the
temperate air created by the eternally hot rivers and
springs was transformed into rain.

Two events of importance marked their stay.
One was the escape of their prisoners, together with
some rifles which they succeeded in stealing. Pursuit
in the darkness, and through the jungle-like
reaches of the forest was almost hopeless and was
quickly abandoned. Nor, although vigilant watch

209

was kept to prevent surprise, did they ever see sign
of the half-breeds again.

âItâs a big valley,â said Mr. Hampton, âand I
doubt whether they will attempt to attack us. Rather,
they will keep out of our way. They are poorly
armed and inferior in numbers, since we have all
come together. Their escape, I imagine, was incited
by a fear of what awaited them if we succeeded
in getting them back to civilization and the
courts. Well,â he said, with a sigh, âI regret, of
course, the loss of witnesses to substantiate the
charges of deviltry which I shall surely bring
against Grimm. Nevertheless, I am glad to be rid
of them.â

It was a sentiment in which all concurred.

The other event referred to was the opening by
means of relayed messages via the Mounted Post
and Edmonton of communication by radio with Mr.
Temple in faraway New York. When word
reached Bobâs father that the Hampton party was
safe and sound and wintering in the wilderness, he
quit work for the day, despite the fact that a big
business deal was clamoring for his attention, and
sped by motor down to his Long Island home.

Bobâs sister, Della, was sitting in the library,
staring spiritlessly out at the Winter landscape. Mr.
Temple stole up behind her and, reaching over her

210

shoulder, thrust the message from the radio corporation
under her eyes.

Dellaâs glance fell and she began to read the
printed words. Then she leaped up, whirled around,
her eyes like two stars, and threw her arms around
her fatherâs neck.

âOh, Daddy, Dad-dee,â she screamed.

He held her off at armâs length and looked at her.
Her eyes began to fill up with happy tears, and once
more she threw herself into his arms.

âWell, kiddy, cry all you want to,â he said, comfortingly,
patting her on the back. âI guess thatâs
the medicine you needed. Youâll be all right now.â

Mr. Templeâs words bore reference to the fact
that for months Dellaâs health had been failing, and
she had shown so little interest in her studies that
it had been considered wiser to take her out of the
boarding school which she attended, and bring her
home.

âOh, yes, Dad-dee,â she sobbed, her face
buried in his coat. âIâll be all right now.â

Then she lifted her tear-stained cheeks and asked
anxiously:

âIt says they are all safeâ
all
? Doesnât it?â

Mr. Temple nodded, a mischievous twinkle in his
eyes.

âYes, kiddy,â he said. âFrankâs safe, too.â

211

âOh, Dad-dee, I didnât mean that,â said Della,
blushing furiously.

âNo need to fib to me, kiddy,â said her father.
âBob is only a brother; but Frankâââ

âNo, you shanât say it,â laughed Della, and she
placed a hand over his mouth.

Nevertheless, it was to be noted that from that
time on Della no longer moped and looked ill, but
took an intense interest in all the daily affairs of
life, even wanting to return at once to school.

âMarjie Faulkner will be dying to talk things
over with me,â she explained to her mother.

âWhy, dear, what do you mean?â

âWellâyou knowâsheâs sweet on Bob.â

âOh, you girls,â said Mrs. Temple, with a sigh.
âYouâll be the death of me. At your ageâââ

âAt our age you were engaged to Father,â said
Della. âNow donât deny it. Dad has even told
me how you planned to elope, but were overheard
by your mother who persuaded you to be conventional
and have a wedding at home.â

Mr. Temple looked across the dinner table at his
wife and grinned shamelessly.

âGeorge, did you tell her that?â

âWhy not? It was the truth.â

âOh, George. Arenât children nowadays hard
enough to handle as it is, without letting them know
how silly we older people were once?â

212

âNow, Mother,â said Della, rising quickly and
going to her motherâs side, and kissing her. âDonât
scold Father. Canât you see heâs dreaming of that
day again?â

And dancing to her fatherâs side, Della dropped
a kiss on the spot where his hair was thinning out,
and then danced gaily from the dining-room.

Once more Mr. Temple grinned at his wife, as he
sipped his coffee. Then putting down the cup, he
leaned forward and said confidentially:

âYou do remember that time, donât you, dear?â

Mrs. Temple started to say something sharp by
way of reproof for his silliness, but a softened look
came into her eyes as she stared back. The years
that intervened since their youth seemed to slip
away.

âWhy, George,â she said. âYou look positively
handsome.â

As for Della, a telegram to her friend, Marjorie
Faulkner, apprised the latter of the message from
the Far North to the effect that the lost had been
found. And Della soon followed her message in
person. Thereafter the two girls were never tired
of talking about the possible adventures that had
befallen the boys, and while Marjorie sang Bobâs
praises, Della sang Frankâs. Poor Jack, it is to be
feared, was somewhat slighted in these discussions.

213

âIâll warrant you that Bob saved the day for
them all,â Marjorie said on one occasion. âHeâs
so big and strong.â

âWell,â flashed Della, âBobâs my brother, and
thatâs all right. But if they ever got in a tight
pinch, Iâm
sure
it was Frank that got them out.
Heâs got more brains than all the rest put together.â

âOh, Della, how can you say that?â cried Marjorie.

âWell, just because Bob is my brother must I be
always praising him?â demanded Della.

For a moment the two girls positively glared at
each other.

Then the twinkle began to come, and they
laughed.

Then they were hugging each other.

And then they were at it again.

214
CHAPTER XXVI.âTREED BY WOLVES.

One more adventure, and that a serious one, was
to befall the boys as a final taste of life in the wilderness.
One day towards the end of Winter, when
the sky cleared after several days of tremendous rain,
the three boys who had been cooped up in their quarters
and had worn out even the amusement of listening
to the Edmonton radio concerts or communicating
with the Post of the Mounted, announced
they were going hunting.

The supply of fresh meat had fallen pretty low,
and additions to their larder would not be unwelcome.
Accordingly, Mr. Hampton made no objection
to their departure, but insisted that Art or Long
Jim accompany them.

âIâd be no good,â said Long Jim. âSence I did
that fool trick oâ cuttinâ my hand with the axe a
couple-three days ago, I cainât set finger to trigger.
You better go, Art.â

âAll right, boys,â said Art. âIâd like to stretch
a leg, too.â

215

The four, accordingly, set out. In the forest surrounding
the spot where they had chosen to erect
their huts, there was no longer any game, for the
animals had come to learn that these strange creatures
brought destruction and had decamped elsewhere.
Finally, after they had proceeded some distance
without sighting anything, Art suggested they
strike for a higher level on the adjacent mountain
side. The huts had been erected near the foot of
one of the ranges rimming the valley.

âMaybe weâll run into a mountain sheep or a
goat,â he said. âAnyhow, we can see better from a
higher lever, for this forest down here is so thick
you can hardly see a yard away. The moonâs out
anâ up there the trees is thinner.â

With Art leading the way, the party began its
upward climb. For some time they toiled upward
until presently they reached a level unaffected by
the more temperate air of the valley floor, and where,
as a consequence, snow covered the rocks. Across
a bare shoulder of rock from which the wind had
swept all but a trace of snow they made their way
and then plunged into a thick woods beyond.

Frank, who was in the rear, laid down his rifle
and bent over to adjust the clumsy lacing of a thick
shoe pack of the kind they had made for themselves
from the skins of slain animals. The others plodding
along, head down, did not notice he had

216

stopped, and kept on going. He spent more time
at the task than he had anticipated, and when finally
he straightened up and picked up his rifle, they were
not in sight.

Frank was not worried, however, for he felt sure
he would be able to trace them in the snow and
would soon catch up with them. He set out at a
brisk pace. The snow grew deeper, however, where
the wind had not had a chance to whisk it away, and
the going was hard. He had proceeded some distance
before he noticed that he had gotten off the
trail left by his companions. Angry with himself
for his carelessness, but still not worried, he halted
to consider what was best for him to do.

âShucks,â he said aloud. âGuess I better go back
over my steps till I find where I left their trail.â

And with this intention, he turned to go back.
Even as he did so, he saw a pack of long gray bodies
racing through the trees in his direction. At the
same instant they gave tongue. It was a pack of
wolves. They had scented him and were now lifting
the cry which announced their prey was near.

Frank started to fling the rifle to his shoulder,
but then he lowered it. The flitting forms were still
yards away. And although moonlight sifted through
the bare limbs of the trees, it did not sufficiently
illumine the scene to make the wolves good targets.
He decided his best plan would be to seek refuge

217

in a tree first of all, and then he could fire at the
wolves at his leisure and with a sureness of aim
that would not now be his. These thoughts or reflections
flashed through his mind in an instant. The
next moment he was putting his plan into execution,
and climbing into a tall fir.

He was not a moment too soon, either, for the
baying came closer and closer and even as he struggled
frantically to climb higher the leader of the wolf
pack reached the foot of his refuge, and sprang high
into the air. Frank heard the snap of the great jaws,
and looked down into a yawning red cavern of a
mouth.

The next moment his rifle slipped from his grasp,
and fell on the snout of the wolf who leaped aside
in temporary panic. Then the rest of the pack arrived
on the scene, jumping and snarling, their
heads in the air, their wicked eyes agleam as they
scented the prey they had treed but which temporarily
had escaped them.

Frank threw an arm around the main trunk of
the tree to steady himself, for he was sick with vexation
at his own carelessness in not having properly,
secured his rifle. Meantime the wolves circled close
about the tree, looking up, and one big fellow even
put his forefeet against the trunk and reared high
till his head rested on the lowermost branch. Then

218

he retired to join the others, and all squatted in an
expectant ring close about the foot of the tree.

When his vexation had passed, Frank set himself
to a serious consideration of his position. And at
once he realized that he must try before it was too
late and they got out of earshot to attract the attention
of his comrades. Perhaps already they had
gotten beyond reach. At that he had a moment of
panic. Then he grew calmer. If they had moved
away, he told himself, they would discover his absence
presently and retrace their steps in search of
him.

He still had his revolver. At first he did not
trust himself to handle it, because of the trembling
of his hands. Then he grew cooler. His hand
steadied. He thought he would shout to attract his
companionsâ attention first of all. And raising his
voice, he sent call after call ringing through the
forest.

The wolves gave back yelp for scream, and soon
the whole pack was snarling and yowling and making
a terrific, demoniac din.

The sound steadied him.

âGood,â he thought, âthe boys will know there
are wolves, anyway.â

Their own snarls reacted on the wolves, exciting
them. And once more they came up to the foot of
the tree, rearing their forefeet against it and leaping

219

upward. It was Frankâs chance, and he took
it.

With one arm clasping the trunk of the tree, he
leaned forward and took careful aim at the biggest
of the grey shapes below. At that moment, the
wolf opened his mouth in a jaw-clashing howl. It
was his last. Frankâs bullet plunged down his
throat, and the wolf rolled over in the snow.

His mates without a secondâs hesitation deserted
their attempts to get at Frank, and began snarling
over the dead body. The sight sickened Frank, and
he closed his eyes a moment. Then the thought occurred
that, if he added several more corpses to the
ghoulish feast, he might divert the attention of the
rest of the pack to such an extent that he would be
able to slip away unseen, perhaps by making his
way through the trees for a short distance before
jumping to the ground.

There was no need now for care in aiming, as
the wolves were in a thick mass over the body of
the fallen, so Frank fired several shots in rapid succession
into the mass. The effect was instantly apparent,
for two more wolves went down, and the
tearing and crunching announced a renewal of the
awful feast.

Now, thought Frank, was his time to escape, if
possible. He had heard no answering replies, and
believed his companions must have gotten out of

220

earshot. If so, he must depend on his own resources
to make his escape. He was about to start
swinging to a nearby tree, the branches of which
interlocked with those of the tree in which he had
found refuge, when the thought occurred that, perhaps,
he would be able to obtain his rifle undiscovered
by the wolves.

Cautiously he started to descend, his eyes alternately
on the snarling wolf pack several yards from
the tree and on the limbs he must grip in his descent.
He had almost reached the lowermost limb
when his grip slipped and he fell.

Frank thought his end had come, but as he struck
the ground his hands closed on the coveted rifle, and
he scrabbled to regain his feet, flinging the rifle to
his shoulder as he did so.

His fall had been seen. One of the wolves turned
aside from the outskirts of the pack, where he was
not getting his share of the gruesome feast, and
sprang for him. The next moment, as a shot rang
out from behind Frank, the wolf dropped quivering
at his feet.

âSteady, Frank,â cried Artâs voice. âGive âem
all youâve got.â

Without looking around, mastering his trembling
by a supreme effort, Frank brought the rifle to his
shoulder and began firing into the pack, even as the
three rifles of his companions also opened fire.

221

At that close range every shot told and not a wolf
escaped. Eleven bodies, including the mutilated remains
of the three which Frank had slain with revolver
shots, were stretched on the snow under the
trees.

When it was all over, his companions gathered
about Frank and explanations followed. Then they
made their way back to camp.

222
CHAPTER XXVIIâCONCLUSION.

Far to the southward, late in the Summer, the
party containing our friends and the Thorwaldsson
party as well as Long Jim Golden, all bronzed and
hardy, and with Thorwaldsson recovered in body
and mind, swung around a bend in a river and came
to the landing which marked the first outpost of
civilizationâthe trading post where was also located
the Fort of the Mounted.

A little boy playing on the edge of the pier was
first to see them, and whooping and shouting he ran
up the bank towards the store. Out of the door
of the trading post came a figure in uniform.

âDick.â

âArt.â

The two pals were reunited.

And then followed the biggest surprise of all, for
out of the store came Mr. Temple and Della. For
ten minutes the kissing and hugging went on, while

223

Farnum, Thorwaldsson, Farrell and the rest stood
to one side, their faces set in wide grins.

âWhat in the world?â demanded Mr. Hampton,
at length, holding his partner and neighbor at armâs
length. âWhat in the world brought you here?â

âA motor boat,â said Mr. Temple. âThat was
a surprise for you. When we received your radio
message via the post here, which relayed it to Edmontonâthat
first one, you know, announcing you
were leaving for the outsideâI decided I would have
to be on hand to greet you. So I got into communication
with Captain Jameson, and learned
from him that I could reach one of his posts farther
south by motor car, and then come up the river in a
launch. So I decided I would come here to the edge
of the wilderness.â

He looked at his son, Bob, about whom he still
kept an arm, and smiled.

âGood old Dad,â said Bob, giving him a hug.
âBut what brought Della?â

âOh, the same means,â answered his father.

âNo, Dad. You know what I mean. Was it
love for her straying brother?â

âWell, now, Bob, youâll have to form your own
opinion,â said Mr. Temple, eyes a-twinkle.

Della who had been standing close to Frank, her
hands clasped in his, looked calmly at Bob.

âMarjie wanted to come, too, you know, Bob,â

224

she said. âBut her mother wouldnât let her. She
sent you a message.â

âHuh.â

Big Bob blushed, and let the conversation drop.
Nevertheless, at the first opportunity he got his sister
to one side, and, snatching the letter she tendered
him, went off by himself to read it.

There was room for Mr. Hampton and the boys
on the launch, and in a canoe towed behind, and so,
after a short rest, a start downstream was made at
once. Thorwaldsson and the others set off with
them, but soon fell behind amid a gay waving of
farewells. Mr. Hampton was to make arrangements
for their reception at the next post and at
Edmonton. The launch would be sent back for
them when the post was reached.

At Edmonton, a thriving city which in the comparatively
few years of its existence has grown to
the proportions of a metropolis, the boys got their
first taste of the publicity which was to pursue them
across the continent, reaching its height on their
arrival in New York. For word of their coming
had gotten out, and hosts of reporters awaited them,
representing the great newspapers and news-gathering
syndicates of not only North America but of
Europe, too.

âYou see, boys,â said Mr. Hampton, in their hotel
rooms, when they protested to him at being besieged

225

every minute of the day by reporters, âyou
are the center of the romantic interest of the world.
You rescued the Lost Expedition and discovered
strange new territory. You have had the wildest
kind of adventures. How do you expect the world
to take that calmly? It canât be done. No, you
may as well submit gracefully, and talk when questioned.â

The romance of Frank and Della also was exploited
by the newspapermen, and pictures began
to appear throughout the country, showing the daring
young explorer and his sweetheart. When they
were taken, neither Frank nor Della knew, but the
truth of the matter was that they were together so
much of the time it was the easiest matter in the
world for a photographer to snap them.

In New York the same thing was gone through
with again, only, if anything, worse. And this time,
the reporters finding that Marjorie Faulkner appeared
to greet the returned heroes, scented a new
romance, and questioned the boys about it. Bob
and Frank refused to answer, but Jack slyly tipped
off the newspapermen that between Marjorie and
Bob a real romance was, indeed, budding.

In reprisal, Bob and Frank put their heads together,
and gave the newspapermen a story to the
effect that Jack was champing at the bit to be off
to old Mexico, there to greet a sweetheart who

226

awaited him, none other, in fact, than the Senorita
Rafaela y Calomares, daughter of an old Don who
had a palace in the Sonora mountains. And in support
of the story they told the newspapermen of
their adventures several years before on the Mexican
border, when they had rescued Mr. Hampton
from captivity and Jack, they said, had fallen in love
with the daughter of the Mexican leader responsible
for Mr. Hamptonâs capture.

It all made good copy for the reporters, who had
about exhausted the possibilities of the northern adventure,
and who now plunged head first into this
former adventure, of which nothing had been known
at the time.

Jack was furious, and threatened to wreak dire
vengeance on Bob and Frank. But the latter pointed
out that they had but turned the tables on him.

âWell, anyway,â he said, finally, beginning to
smile, âyou havenât got the best part of the story
yet.â

Their curiosity aroused, they tried to get him to
tell what he meant. But he refused. Several days
later he disappeared. When they asked Mr. Hampton
what had become of him he finally surrendered
and gave the secret away.

âWell, boys,â he said, âwhen we returned I
found a courteous note from Don Fernandez y
Calomares, saying he was in Washington on business

227

connected with the government, and asking me
to call. I guess Jack has taken a train for Washington,
and gone calling.â

With which happy forecast of good luck to come
to all three of the Radio Boys, we shall leave them
for the present, secure in the belief that if at any
future date they go adventuring they will be well
able to take care of themselves, and also that they
will get into adventures well worth reading about.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

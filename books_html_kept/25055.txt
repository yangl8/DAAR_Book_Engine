INTRODUCTION

Mathias Casimire Sarbiewski (1595-1640) vas a Polish Jesuit whose
neo-Latin Horatian odes and Biblical paraphrases gained immediate
European acclaim upon their first publication in 1625 and 1628.
1
The fine lyric
quality of Sarbiewskiâs poetry, and the fact that he often fused
classical and Christian motifs, made a critic like Hugo Grotius actually
prefer the âdivine Casimireâ to Horace himself, and his popularity among
the English poets is evidenced by an impressive number of
translations.

G. Hilsâs
Odes of Casimire
(1646), here reproduced by
permission from the copy in the Henry E. Huntington Library, is the
earliest English collection of translations from the verse of the Polish
Horace. It is also the most important. Acknowledged translations of
individual poems appeared in Henry Vaughanâs
Olor Iscanus
(1651),
Sir Edward Sherburneâs
Poems and Translations
(1651), the

Miscellany Poems and Translations by Oxford Hands
(1685), Isaac
Wattsâs
Horae Lyricae
(1706), Thomas Brownâs
Works

(1707-8), and John Hughesâs
The Ecstasy. An Ode
(1720).
Unacknowledged paraphrases from Casimire include Abraham Cowleyâs âThe
Extasie,â
2
John Norrisâs âThe Elevation,â
3
and a number of Isaac Wattsâs
pious and moral odes.
4
Latin editions of Casimireâs odes appeared in London in
1684, and in Cambridge in 1684 and 1689.

Another striking example of the direct influence of Casimire upon
English poetry is presented by Edward Benlowesâs
Theophila

(1652). This long-winded epic of the soul exhibits not only a general
indebtedness in imagery and ideas, but also direct borrowings of whole
lines from Hilsâs
Odes of Casimire
. One example will have to
suffice:

ii

Casimire, Ode IV, 44

Theophila
, XIII, 68

Let thâ
Goth
his strongest chaines prepare,

Then let fierce Goths their strongest chains prepare;

The
Scythians
hence mee captive teare,

Grim Scythians me their slave declare;

My mind being free with you, Iâle stare

The Tyrants in the face....

My soul being free, those tyrants in the face Iâll stare.

Casimireâs greatest achievement was in the field of the philosophic
lyric, and in a number of cases he anticipated poetic techniques and
motifs which later grew popular also with the English poets. Thus, long
before Denham and Marvell, he practised the technique of investing the
scenes of nature with a moral or spiritual significance.
A comparison of Casimireâs loco-descriptive first epode on the
estate of the Duke of Bracciano with Denhamâs
Cooperâs Hill

(1642) reveals that the Polish poet was the first to mix description
with moral reflection, and to choose the gentle hills, the calmly
flowing river, and a retired country life as symbols of the Horatian
golden mean.

Some of Casimireâs richest imagery is found in his paraphrases of

Canticles
, and particularly in Ode IV, 21. Parts of this ode
provide a striking parallel to the famous fifth stanza of Marvellâs âThe
Garden.â In it Horace and Virgil meet with Solomon, the
hortus
conclusus
of the Hebrew poet merging with the landscape of
retirement as we find it in Virgilâs eclogues or in Horaceâs second and
sixteenth epodes. Much of Casimireâs poetry, is indeed best understood
as a conscious effort to apply the allegorical technique of

Canticles
to the classical
beatus ille
-themes,
5
just as his
thought presents an interesting combination
of
Stoic and Platonic
ideas.

iii

The Polish poet, who was a university professor and a doctor of
theology, may easily have learned from the Hermetic writers how to
combine these great classical traditions. There is direct proof of
Casimireâs familiarity with the Hermetic tradition in his Ode II, 5
(âE Rebus Humanis Excessusâ), which is a paraphrase of

Libellus I
, sections 25 and 26.
6
Since Henry Vaughan was
familiar with Casimireâs poetry, it is reasonable to suspect that
Vaughanâs own treatment of Hermetic motifs owed much to this influence.
If one compares Vaughanâs religious nature lyrics and Casimireâs odes,
a number of common poetical motifs are easily found, and so we are
here again faced with the fact that themes which became popular in
England in the mid-seventeenth century were anticipated in the Latin
odes of Casimire.
7

Hermetic ideas are also encountered in Casimireâs third epode, which
combines a Horatian Stoicism with a neo-Platonlc or Hermetic
interpretation of the classical landscape of retirement. An avowed reply
to Horaceâs second epode, it expands the Horatian philosophy through the
addition of three new themes: the theme of solitude, the theme of the
Earthly Paradise, and the theme of Nature as a divine hieroglyph. Its
presentation of the garden ecstasy of the retired
beatus vir
thus
strikes the same note to which we know from Mildmay Faneâs âTo
Retirednessâ and Andrew Marvellâs âThe Garden.â In slightly adapted
form, these themes were to flourish in the poetry of the Countess of
Winchilsea, Isaac Watts, John Hughes, and a number of early
eighteenth-century nature poets.

In the Romantic period Casimireâs fame was again revived. While still
a young man, Coleridge planned a complete translation of Casimireâs

iv

odes, but never finished more than the ode âAd Lyram.â It was also
Coleridge who said that with the exception of Lucretius and Statius he
knev no Latin poet, ancient or modern, who could be said to equal
Casimire in boldness of conception, opulence of fancy, or beauty of
versification.
8
A knowledge of the themes and techniques of this
Latin poet should therefore be of interest to all students of English
poetry.

In the preface to
The Ecstasy. An Ode
(1720), John Hughes
comments on Cowleyâs indebtedness, in âThe Extasie,â to Casimire.

3.

Norrisâs indebtedness has been pointed out by Hoxie N. Fairchild,

(New York, 1939- ), I,
110, n. 21.

4.

Compare Wattsâs âFalse Greatness,â ââTis Dangerous to Follow the
Multitude,â and âThe Kingdom of the Wise Manâ to Casimireâs Ode IV, 34;
IV, 10; and IV, 3.

5.

By this term is understood the themes presented in Horaceâs second epode
on the happy country life.

No study has as yet been made of Casimireâs influence upon English
literature, but I hope shortly to publish the results of my own
investigation of this problem.

Coleridge prefaced his translation of the ode âAd Lyramâ with this
remark. See also

Winter turnes Spring to seeât.

85

While in the sacred Green, a bowâre we see

Doth spread it selfe for thee.

The Earth new Turffâs it selfe for thee to tread,

The straying starrs fresh fields make glad.

Here with their dams, of Kids thâamazed flocks

Hang on steep sides of Rocks;

Here as they swim, the wanton Hinds do play

In the coole streames all day.

It Leo cum Pardo viridis de colle Saniri

In vitrio pisces saliunt hilares crystallo,

The Lion with the Libard downe is lâed

Tame and well governed;

Each with his Lamb about the Mountaines skip,

Oâre Hills they lightly trip.

By these a spacious brooke doth slowly glide,

Which with a spreading tyde

Through bending Lilyes, banks of Violets

From thâhollow Pumice sweats.

The rivers gently flow, and a still sound

From mossie Rocks doth bound.

The sporting fish dance in the christall Mayne,

The Birds sweetly complaine,

Nec verÃ², si mÅsta placent saletia cÃ¦lo

Flebile murmur abest:

86

Nam sibi dum vestro regemunt ex orbe palumbes,

Huc sonus ille venit.

Sic dum se viduo solatur Carmine turtur,

Gaudia nostra placent.

The ayre, if dolefull comforts please, doth ring

With mournfull murmuring.

87

For when the Doves eccho each others cry

That sound doth hither fly.

As they with widowed notes themselves do please,

Just so, our joyes increase.

Cetera non desunt, pronis vindemia pendet

No want appeares; thâofficious Vine doth stand

With bending clusters to our hand.

Here, thou shalt pick sweet Violets, and there

Fresh Lillyes all the yeare:

The Apple ripe drops from its stalke to thee,

From tast of death made free.

The luscious fruit from the full Figtree shall

Into thy bosome fall.

IntereÃ  falcem vindemia nescit, aratrum

Saucia nescit humus.

Meane while, the Vine no pruning knife doth know,

The wounded earth no plow.

The Corne growes green alone, and thâunhurt land

Doth white with harvest stand.

The grasse affords a stately bed, the Plane

Spreads thee to entertaine.

Arabian mists sweat from the gummy tree

Of Balme, and all for thee;

89

Which through the ayre, a rich perfume doe throw,

Fannâd with each neighbâring bough.

Surge; quid indignos ducis per tÃ¦dia soles?

Surge, age, cara soror.

Ecce tuis ipsÃ¦ iam circum frÃ¦na columbÃ¦

Arise my Sister deare, why dost thou stay,

And spend thâunwilling day?

Behold thy harnessâd Doves, at thy delay

Doe sigh, come, drive away.

Put on, and hither drive thy beauteous paire

Of Doves, thy selfe more faire.

S

Ãternos fere conjugis annos;

Jure per assiduos (procerum fortissime) fletus

Ereptam quererÃªre,
Janussi
.

Quem Pietas quem non moveat non tristibus unquam

Arx animi concussa procellis

90

Et pudor, & proni niveo de pectore sensus,

Et Regina modestia morum,

Aut bona sedulitas, aut non incauta futuri

PrÃ¦sagÃ¦ solertia montis?

W

hat though the Gods have promisâd she shall
bee

Enfranchisâd to Eternity?

Yet (valiant Sir) so great a losse still cryes

For a just tribute from your eyes;

View but her pious mind, that towâre of state

Not shaken by sad stownes of Fate,

91

Her humble innocent soule, her guiltlesse feare,

Her modesty chiefe Regent there;

The prudent thrift of her presaging mind

Her constant zeale, pure and refinâd;

And who can then forbeare tâembalme her Hearse

With the daily precious dew of teares?

Provida sed longam magnis virtutibus Ã¦vum

Non audent promittere fata:

Nec possunt, si quÃ¦ maturavÃ©re, profanis

Astra diu committere terris.

Nunc adeÃ² parces longis onerare querelis

Depositum repetentia magnum,

Ingentes animi gazas, & robur, & aureo

Incoctum benÃ¨ pectus honesto.

Tis not in Fate to promise length of dayes,

To things of such esteeme and praise;

Nor can the starrs suffer so ripe a birth

To be long sullied with dull earth.

Load not the Heavens then with unjust complaints,

For taking back one of their Saints.

The courage of her richly tempâred breast

Made her for them a fitter guest:

Such jewells of her mind sparkle about her

The starres themselves canât shine without her.

Sic Tanaquil, sic quÃ¦ cunctantem Claudia rexit

VirgineÃ¢ cervice Cybellen,

QuÃ¦que maritali successit Thessala fato,

Et Latiis vaga ClÅlia ripis;

Ante diem raptÃ¦ vivunt post funera, vatum

Perpetuos in carmine fastos.

Steerâd the unwilling Barke to land.

Thus shee, that durst her Husbands fate abide,

And

Too early cropâd, survive in Poesie,

And keepe perpetuall jubilie.

93

âTis not in Art to fetch her back againe,

Or charme the spirits with
Orpheus

straine,

To breake the bars of Adamant or scale

The Rampiers of thâ Elysian wall,

No Orisons prevaile, sent from the breast

Of great

Yet in the arched entrance chinks there bee,

Which may befriend the covetous eye;

Through these to thâhidden mysteries I peep,

And (if the spirits nor dream, nor sleep)

I saw, or else me thoughts, I there had seene

Her, wandring oâre a Spacious Greene,

With walls of Diamond, gates of purest glasse,

No Chrystall more transparent was:

Each blade of grasse was gold, each tree was there,

A golden Periwig did weare.

Auro prata virent; arbor crinitur in aurum;

Crispantur violaria gemmis,

QuÃ¦ nec ApellÃ¦us liquor, nec pulchra trigoni

Assimulent mendacia vitri.

The swelling banks of Violets did curle

Themselves with Gems, and Orient Pearle;

The glorious nothing, of the

And all

Through the sweet vales a Quire of Damsels sing

Eternall PÃ¦ans to their King.

The stars with sparkling light stand round I see,

Twinkling to their shrill melodie.

Her and her tender darling, then I spy,

Iâthâ midâst of that blest company;

With looks more fresh and sweet, then are the Roses

Of which her Garlands shee composes—

Two flowry Chaplets, which with Gems set round

Her owne and
Nephewâs
temples crownâd.

Cetera me vetuit magni caligo sereni

Mortali percurrere visu.

Nectu plura velis; satis est, cui fata dederunt

Aeternis mutasse caduca.

But here a veyle was drawne, I must not prie

Nor search too farre with mortall eye,

Nor would you more. It may suffice that shee

Hath changâd fraile flesh for blest Eternitie.

In my soft dreames, me thinks, I see

With joy transported, upward soare,

The flowry Meddowes, and the pastures oâre;

Where the greene Grove its coole shade yeilds

To thâstately grasse plotts, and ripe swelling

The lightning leaps too, at my ravishing songs;

Iris

And with her divers colourâd bow, Iâme bound.

Being now my selfe, and newly wakâd,

My not unwelcome dreames, just now off shakâd;

Thrice oâre my Lute, I scarce had run

With nible finger neat division;

Remembring
Horace

When my high Genius through thâayre doth ride;

Now oâre the scattâred Islands, then

Oâre Seas, with dry feet passing back again;

RomÃ¦que servitum fluunt.

Where
Flora
makes the banks, and gives the name

To Fountaines, proud of so much fame;

From lively stones perpetuall waters flow,

And wash the fields wheresoeâre they goe,

Their father
Tyber
, and their King they found

And flow to
Rome
, with homage bound.

Sincera circÃ¹m regna naturÃ¦ nitent;

Et artis immunes loci:

Adhucque virgo sulcus, & montes adhuc

Molleis inexperti manus,

Meramque Bacchus Tethyn, & Bacchum Thetis,

Et pinguis invitat Ceres.

Nature doth purely there advance each part,

Not any place is helpâd by Art:

As yet the virgin furrow, thâHills yet stand

Untouchâd, by any tender hand.

Chast
Tethys
,
Bacchus
courts,
Thetis
doth
woo

Bacchus
againe, and
Ceres
too.

Hinc ille lÃ¦tus surgit, & tenacibus

Inserpit ulmis Evius,

Udoque cornu turget, & fluentibus

Crinem racemis impedit.

Non Lesbos illi, non odorati magis

Vineta rident Massici,

114

Aut quÃ¦ Falernis educata solibus

Sublucet uvÃ¦ purpura.

Hence
Evius
cheerfull rises, and doth twine

With thâElme, that closely clings tothâ Vine,

Withâs plenteous horne he swells, his locks hang by—

With flowing Clusters tangled lye.

Not
Lesbos
him, nor the sweet smelling grace,

Of rich
Campania
âs fruitfull race

115

Delights; the purple Grape not so faire showes,

In the
Falernian
sun that growes.

Sed nec Falisci glaream malit soli,

Nec pinguis uber RhÃ¦tiÃ¦;

Nec flava tantÃ¹m culta felicis Cypri,

GraiÃ¡mve dilexit Rhodon:

QuantÃ¹m suis superbit, & sese suis

Miratur in canalibus.

CircÃ¹m beatis imperat campis Ceres.

Lateque rura possidet:

Et arva flavo messium fluctu tument,

Motuque culmorum natant.

Heeâl not preferre
Faliscus
sandy ground,

Nor
RhÃ¦tia
, that doth so abound;

The yellow Tilths of happy
Cyprus
, hee

Neâre lovâd so much, nor
Rhodos
by:

As in his owne — in his owne channells hee

Hugging himselfe, doth proudly lye.

Sole Empresse
Ceres
of the fertile lands

Whose large possessions shee commands:

The fields with yellow waves doe ebbe and flow,

The ripe eares swim, when winds doe blow.

Innube rarus inquinat cÃ¦lum vapor,

Aut tensa nimbis vellera:

Aut Ã¨ Boreis bella ventorum plagis,

Raucusque silvarum fragor

Auditur usquam: non protervis insonant

Exercitati Syrtibus,

Euris & Austris contumaces Africi,

Et perduellibus Notis.

No vapour, here, Heavens cleared face doth staine,

No clowdy fleece stretchâd out with raine:

The Northerne blasts are still, and all at peace,

And the hoarse noise oâthâ woods doth cease:

The stubborne
Africke
winds that use to stray

About thâunruly sandy Sea,

Are all hushâd up, and no Alarum sound

To thâ other winds, entrenched round;

116

TantÃ¹m serenus Vesper, & tenerrima

Etesiarum flamina.

Albique soles, & serena lucidis

Aspirat aura montibus:

Puramque cÃ¦lo provehunt HorÃ¦ facem,

Et PhÅbus Horarum pater

Peculiari luce colles irrigat,

PronÃ¡que perfundit die.

117

Onely the Evening faire, a gentle gale

Of winds that each year never faile:

The bright Sun darting through thâenlightned Ayre

His beames, doth guild the
Moutaines
cleare,

The houres drive on heavâns torch, that shine so bright,

And
PhÅbus
father of the light—

With a peculiar influence bedewes

The Hills all oâre, when night ensues.

Ramis tepentes ingruunt Favonii

Jocantis aurÃ¦ sibilo,

Et temperatis provocant suspiriis,

At non loquaces interim nidi tacent,

Sed aut maritis turtur in ramis gemit,

Et saxa rumpit questibus,

Famosa pellex ThraciÃ¦.

The warme
Favonian
winds with whistling gale

Doe merrily the boughs assaile,

And with their temperate breath, and gentle noise,

Sweet pleasing slumbers softly raise.

The prateling Nests meane while no silence keep,

Their wandring guests neâre sleep.

Toâs mate, the Turtle âmongâst the branches grones,

And with complaints breakes hardest stones,

The Nightingale, the pleasant Groves about

Refresheth, with her warbling note,

Silvisq

118

Affatur ilex ilicem,

Et se vicissim collocuta redditis

Bewayles her losse to thâwoods, iâthâ cruell fields

âGainst
Tereus
her cryes shee yeilds:

119

And what the mournfull birds doe so complaine,

The shrill woods answer back againe.

The Oke, the Alder tells; the Poplar tree

The Ash; and that, the Elme stands by.

The Groves rejoyce with thâEccho they afford

And tell them backe—evân word for word.

Great Ruler of thâ

Withdraw thy selfe from cares, from all resort

So cloyâd withâ Citie, and with Court,

So full of great affaires, at length thy breast

Convey to thy domestick rest.

Hic vel tuarum lene tranabis vadum

Here thou mayâst passe thy Foord, in gloomy shade,

On each side, by thine owne trees made,

And here between thy Mounts, with tall Okes set,

A large walke thou shalt get:

Or in
December
, when the fields looke white,

And thâHills, with the earlyest snow doth light;

Sometime thâentangled game, with twining nett

Iâthâ wood, with feare thou shalt besett:

121

G2

Sometimes with courser fleet, pursue full sore,

The Buck thou mayst, sometimes the Bore;

With thy thrown dart the red Deer thou shalt stick.

And thâfrighted ravenous Wolves shalt strick,

And if that Starre oâthâ sacred dignity

The glory of all

Will also from his cares, himselfe make free,

And keepe his Festivals with thee;

Each Citizen of thine, and every guest

With the compleatest joy is blest.

The Meads, and leapâst, men heare thy voice;

May thâwhistling leaves of Poplar trees

With their unwelcome murmurs cease—

Who, with the burthen of his cares,

Farre off hath left his fatherâs ground, set free

From the fierce wrangling Lawyerâs fee;

No scorching heat, nor blasts of Winter
Jove
,

Doth hurt his fruit, or him can move:

Hee shuns all strifes, and never doth resort

The sinfull gates oâthâ greedy Court.

Ergo aut profanis hactenus negotiis

Amissa plorat sidera;

Aut in reductÃ¢ sede dispersum gregem

Postquam beatÃ¦ lucra conscientiÃ¦

But either doth bewayle those dayes and nights,

Lost by him in prophane delights;

Or else retyrâd, strives to collect and find

The dispersâd flock ofâs wandring mind;

Having first fairly poisâd the recompence

And gaines of a good conscience.

G5

At evening, when the harbinger of night

The torches of the sky doth light,

How he admires thâimmortall rayes breake forth,

And their bright Orbes, more large then earth;

How through his trickling teares, he heips his fight,

Unto the open Courts of light,

Which with thy selfe, Ã´ Christ, thy selfe in prayâr

Heâ Adores, tâEternall life an heire!

Volvuntur aureis interim stellaÃ¦ rotis,

At quando lotum Gangis aut Indi fretis

Mentis profundus, & sui totus minor

Irata flectit numina:

The Starres with golden wheeles, are hurried by,

And let their prostrate exile lye,

Over whose face, the plenteous teares doe stray,

Which chase all drowsie sleepe away;

Assoone as
PhÅbus
head begins tâappeare,

Lately in
Indus
streames made cleare,

From depth of soule, lesse then himselfe he lies,

And bends the angry powârs with cryes:

Vel cum sereno fulserit dies Jove,

Aprilibusque feriis,

Assueta cÃ¦lo lumina, in terras vocat

128

Or when the Sun shines cleare, the aire serene,

And
Aprill
Festivals begin,

His eyes, so usâd to Heaven, he downe doth throw,

On a large prospect here below:

129

He viewes the fields, and wondring stands to see

Inâs shade the shining Deitie.

En omnis inquit, herba non morantibus

In astra luctatur comis:

Semota cÃ¦lo lacrymantur, & piis

Liquuntur arva fletibus;

Ligustra canis, & rosÃ¦ rubentibus

Repunt in auras brachiis;

Astrisque panda nescio quid pallido

Loquuntur ore lilia,

Et serÃ² blandis ingemunt suspiriis,

Et manÃ¨ rorant lacrymis.

See how (saies he) each herb with restlesse leaves

To thâ starres doth strive and upward heaves:

Removâd from heaven they weep, the field appeares

All oâre dissolvâd in pious teares:

The white-flowrâd Woodbine, and the blushing Rose

Branch into thâaire with twining boughs;

The pale-facâd Lilly on the bending stalke,

To thâstarres I know not what doth talke;

At night with fawning sighes theyâexpresse their fears

And in the morning drop downe teares.

EgÃ³ne solus, solus in terris piger

Tenace figor pondere?

Sic & propinquas allocutus arbores,

Et multa coram fontibus

Rivisque fatus, quÃ¦rit Auctorem
Deum

Formosa per vestigia.

Am I alone, wretch that I am, fast bound

And held with heavy weight, to thâground?

Thus spake he to the
neighbouring
trees, thus he

To thâFountaines talkâd, and streames
ran by,

And after, seekes the great Creator out

By these faire traces of his foot.

Quod si levandas mentis in curas vigil

Ruris suburbani domus,

130

Quales Lucisci, vel Nemecini Lares,

UdumvÃ¨ Besdani nemus

Rudeis adornet rusticÃ¢ mensas dape

Siccos sub Augusti dies;

But if a lightsome Country house thatâs free

From care, such as
Luciscuâs
bee,

131

Or
Nemiciniâs,
if
Besdan
âs fruitfull field

Can Grace to his rude table yeild,

To his plaine board with country dainties set,

In
August
âs dry and parching heat;

Jam tunc sub ipsum limen, aut domesticÃ¢

Lenis sub umbrÃ¢ populi,

Expectat omnis hospitem suum penses,

Et concha sinceri salis,

Pressiq
ue
meta lactis, & purus calix,

Et hospitalis amphora,

Et fraga, raris verna quÃ¦ dumis legit,

Jucunda panis prÃ¦mia.

Even at his dore, under a private shade

By a thick pleasant Poplar made,

Provision of all sorts, expect their guest,

A shell with salt, pure and the best,

New bread, for which, âmidst the thin bryars, the Mayd

Picks Strawberries, andâs gladly payd.

Cheese newly pressâd, close by, the friendly Cann

With Cup cleane washâd, doth ready stanâ.

Non me scari tunc, non Lucrinorum gravis

Sagina mulorum juvet:

Sed cereus palumbus, aut turtur niger;

Aut anser amnis accola,

Et eruditam quÃ¦ fugit gulam faba,

LÃ¦tumque nec simplex olus,

Et quÃ¦ suprema colligitur, ac gravi

Patella nil debet foro.

With me the
Lucrine
dainties will not downe,

The Scare, nor Mullet thatâs well growne;

But the Ring-dove plump, the Turtle dun doth looke,

Or Swan, the sojourner oâthâ brooke,

A messe of Beanes which shuns the curious pallet,

The cheerfull and not simple sallet;

Clusters of grapes last gathered, that misse

And nothing owe to thâweighty presse.

132

Post hÃ¦c vel inter lÃ¦ta quercetis juga,

Vel inter amneis juverit

Vitare tristeis post meridiem Notos

Sub Ã¦sculo vel ilice;

NigrumvÃ¨ littus, aut opaca lubricis

Tranare stagna lintribus,

JactÃ¢que fruge ludibundum ducere

Tremente piscem lineÃ¢.

133

Then after noone he takes a kind of pride

To thâHills to walke, or River side,

And âmidst the pleasant Okes, a shade doth find,

Tâavoyd the blasts oâthâ Southern wind;

To thâdarksome shore, by the deep poole he goes,

And through, with nimble Boat he rowes;

Sometimes the sporting fish, his baite thrown in,

Hee plucks up with his trembling line.

Remugit ingens interim tauris nemus,

Umbrosa balant flumina;

Et aut in antris garriunt acanthides,

Aut in rubis luscinia.

Hinc per rubeta pastor errantes capras

Vocante cogit fistulÃ¢:

Illinc herili messor Ã¨ campo redux

Alterna plaudit carmina;

Et pressa sectos plaustra per sulcos gemunnt

Ruptura ruris horrea.

Meane while thâ spacious woods with ecchoing note

Doe answer to the Bulls wide throat,

The shady rivers bleat; the Nightingale

Iâthâ bushes chirps her dolefull tale.

Withâs hastning pipe the sheapheard drives away

His flocke, which through the thickets stray:

To which as from the field they passe along,

Each mower sings by course, his song;

Oâre yeilding furrowes, carts full pressâd with corne

Groane, and are like to breake the barne.

At nec tacemus ponÃ¨ considentium

Dulcis manus sodalium;

134

Nec infacetÃ¢ sermo differtur morÃ¢,

Sed innocentibus jocis,

Multoq

tinctus, sed verecundo sale,

Innoxium trahit dÃ®em.

HÃ¦c si videret fÃ¦nerator Alphius,

Olim futurus rusticus,

Quam collocarat Idibus pecuniam,

Nollet Kalendis ponere.

Our worke once done, we doe not silent sit,

When knots of our good fellowes meet;

135

Nor is our talke prolongâd with rude delay;

In harmlesse jests we spend the day;

Jests dipâd in so much salt, which rubbing shall

Onely make fresh our cheeks, not gall.

If that rich churle, this had but seen, when hee

A Country man began to be,

The money which iâthâ Ides hee scraped in

Next month heeâd not put out agen.

Additional Notes

Variant Spellings

Introduction:
The editorâs name, printed âRoestvigâ, is more
correctly RÃ¸stvig.

Latin:
The use of Å and Ã¦ in words such as âmÅstusâ is in the
original. Accents are variously acute Â´, grave ` or
circumflex ^, with no apparent difference in meaning. Some do not
even mark long syllables.

English:
Variation between -w- and -vv- is in the
original.

Typography:
In both languages, poem titles were randomly
Italic or Roman. Italicization (or de-italicization) of âs in
possessives is also random.

Long s (Å¿)

At the beginning of
p. 10
there appears to
have been an accident with the Italic type trays. Almost all long sâs
(Å¿) on p. 10 (signature 5
v
), and many on
p. 12
(signature 6
v
), are misprinted as f,
except in the -st- and -ss- ligatures. Misprints are shown in red,
correct forms in blue; the page thumbnails are linked to larger views.
Note the one Å¿-for-f error on page 12.

â
Ode 44, Lib.
4.
â

The printed number is retained, though it is almost certainly an
error for â14â (between 13 and 15). The error may have been carried over
from the source text.

Vilna : Vilia

In
Ode 35 of Lib. 4
, âVilnaâ is the city
(modern Vilnius, Wilna in Polish), âViliaâ the river (modern
Vilnia).

Page Numbering

Page numbers 95-96 are repeated, and the setback in numbering
continues to the end of the text. The folio numbers (in duodecimo, or
sets of 24 pages) remain correct.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

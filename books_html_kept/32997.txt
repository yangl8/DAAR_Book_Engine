THE AIM OF THE DETROIT NEWS

Formation of a newspaper's ideals comes through a process of years. The
best traditions of the past, blending with hopes of the future, should
be the writer's guide for the day. Nov. 1, 1916, the editor-in-chief of
The Detroit News, in a letter to the managing editor, wrote his
interpretation of the principles under which the staff should work, in
striving toward those journalistic ideals to which this paper feels
itself dedicated. His summary of the best practices of the profession
follows:

The Detroit News should be:

Vigorous, but not vicious.

Interesting, but not sensational.

Fearless, but fair.

Accurate as far as human effort can obtain accuracy.

Striving ever to gain and impart information.

As bright as possible, but never sacrificing solid information for
brilliancy.

Looking for the uplifting rather than the depraved things of life.

We should work to have the word RELIABLE stamped on every page of the
paper.

The place to commence this is with the staff members: First, getting men
and women of character to do the writing and editing; and then training
them in our way of thinking and handling news and other reading matter.

If you make an error you have two duties to perform—one to the person
misrepresented and one to your reading public. Never leave the reader of
The News misinformed on any subject. If you wrongfully write that a man
has done something that he did not do, or has said something that he did
not say, you do him an injustice—that's one. But you also do thousands
of readers an injustice, leaving them misinformed as to the character of
the man dealt with. Corrections should never be made grudgingly. Always
make them cheerfully, fully, and in larger type than the error, if there
is any difference.

The American people want to know, to learn, to get information. To quote
a writer: "Your opinion is worth no more than your information." Give
them your information and let them draw their own conclusions. Comment
should enlighten by well marshaled facts, and by telling the readers
what relation an act of today has to an act of yesterday. Let them come
to their own conclusions as far as possible.

No issue is worth advocating that is not strong enough to withstand all
the facts that the opposition to it can throw against it. Our readers
should be well informed on both sides of every issue.

[2]
Kindly, helpful suggestions will often direct officials in the right,
when nagging will make them stay stubbornly on the wrong side. That does
not mean that there should be any lack of diligence in watching for, and
opposing, intentional criminals.

A staff can be good and strong only by having every part of it strong.
The moment it becomes evident that a man, either by force of
circumstance or because of his own character, does not fit into our
organization, you do him a kindness and do justice to the paper by
letting him know, so he can go to a calling in which he can succeed, and
will not be in the way of filling the place with a competent man.

No one on the staff should be asked to do anything that will make him
think less of himself or the paper.

MAKE THE PAPER GOOD ALL THE WAY THROUGH, so there will not be
disappointment on the part of a reporter if his story is not found on
the first page, but so he will feel that it must have merit to get into
the paper at all. Avoid making it a "front-page paper."

Stories should be brief, but not meager. Tell the story, all of it, in
as few words as possible.

Nature makes facts more interesting than any reporter can imagine them.
There is an interesting feature in every story, if you will dig it out.
If you don't get it, it is because you don't dig deep enough.

The most valuable asset of any paper is its reputation for telling the
truth; the only way to have that reputation is to tell the truth.
Untruth due to carelessness or excessive imagination injures the paper
as much as though intentional.

Everyone with a grievance should be given a respectful and kindly
hearing; especial consideration should be given the poor and lowly, who
may be less capable of presenting their claims than those more favored
in life. A man of prominence and education knows how to get into the
office and present his complaint. A washerwoman may come to the door,
timidly, haltingly, scarcely knowing what to do, and all the while her
complaint may be as just as that of the other complainant, perhaps more
so. She should be received kindly and helped to present what she has to
say.

Simple, plain language is strongest and best. A man of little education
can understand it, while the man of higher education, usually reading a
paper in the evening after a day's work, will read it with relish. There
is never any need of using big words to show off one's learning. The
object of a story or an editorial is to inform or convince; but it is
hard to do either if the reader has to study over a big word or an
involved sentence. Use plain English all the time. A few readers may
understand and appreciate a Latin or French quotation, or one from some
other foreign language, but the big mass of our readers are the plain
people, and such a quotation would be lost on the majority.

[3]
Be fair. Don't let the libel laws be your measure in printing of a
story, but let fairness be your measure. If you are fair, you need not
worry about libel laws.

Always give the other fellow a hearing. He may be in the wrong, but even
that may be a matter of degree. It wouldn't be fair to picture him as
all black when there may be mitigating circumstances.

It is not necessary to tell the people that we are honest, or bright, or
alert, or that a story appeared exclusively in our paper. If true, the
public will find it out. An honest man does not need to advertise his
honesty.

Time heals all things but a woman's damaged reputation. Be careful and
cautious and fair and decent in dealing with any man's reputation, but
be doubly so—and then some—when a woman's name is at stake. Do not by
direct statement, jest or careless reference raise a question mark after
any woman's name if it can be avoided—and it usually can be. Even if a
woman slips, be generous; it may be a crisis in her life. Printing the
story may drive her to despair; kindly treatment may leave her with
hope. No story is worth ruining a woman's life—or a man's, either.

Keep the paper clean in language and thought. Profane or suggestive
words are not necessary. When in doubt, think of a 13-year-old girl
reading what you are writing.

Do not look on newspaper work as a "game," of pitilessly printing that
on which you are only half informed, for the mere sake of beating some
other paper; but take it rather as a serious, constructive work in which
you are to use all your energy and diligence to get all the worth-while
information for your readers at the earliest possible moment.

[4]

INSTRUCTIONS TO REPORTERS

When you go after a story, make sure that you get all of it.

Drill yourself into searching for facts; almost anybody can write a
story—it takes real brains and resourcefulness to get one.

You are urged to call the city editor for instructions whenever in
doubt, and it is a good idea to call as often as possible to keep the
office informed and also to get any information on your story that may
have come in from other sources.

Before you write or telephone your story, make sure that you have all
your facts marshaled in your own mind. A good reporter usually plans his
story, lead and details in his head on his way to the office.

NEVER GUESS.

KNOW WHAT YOU ARE WRITING ABOUT.

When you turn in a story KNOW that everything in that story is true—and
if you feel there is a statement you can not prove, call your city
editor's attention to it.

To color or fake a story is not newspaper work—it is prostitution of
the profession of journalism.

Be sure of your sources of information. Never take anything for
granted—find out for yourself. You will discover that many persons talk
convincingly about things although they have no actual knowledge of the
subject under discussion.

Remember always that a newspaper has to prove what it says—and any
decent newspaper is eager to.

If you don't know, tell the city editor you don't know. To guess is
criminal because nobody can guess with any consistent degree of
accuracy. And accuracy should be your guide.

Reporters should study their stories after they are printed, with the
realization that any changes made in them were made to better them. Ask
why your stories have been changed so your next story will be better
through avoidance of the same mistake.

Never be afraid to ask anybody anything.

The mainspring of a good newspaper man is a wholesome curiosity.

The essentials of newspaper writing are accuracy and simplicity. The
newspaper is no place for fine writing. Simplicity means directness and
conciseness in telling the story as well as an avoidance of hifalutin
phrases, obsolete words and involved sentences.

Walt Whitman wrote: "The art of arts, the glory of expression, and the
sunshine
[5]
of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than
simplicity—nothing can make up for excess or the lack of definiteness."

Every worker on a newspaper knows the value of accuracy. Accuracy is the
god before whom all newspaper men bow. If one could analyze the effort
put forth in one day in this office, one might discover that perhaps a
third of that effort was in an attempt to obtain accuracy. The city
directory is the newspaper man's Bible because accuracy is his deity.

The hardest lesson the journalist must learn is the development of the
impersonal viewpoint. He must learn to write what he sees and hears,
clearly and accurately, with never a tinge of bias. His own views, his
personal feelings and his friendships should have nothing to do with
what he writes in a story.

The ideal reporter would be a man who could give the public facts about
his bitterest enemy even though such facts would make the man he
personally hated a hero before the public.

In journalism more than in any other profession does the advice hold
good: "Beware of your friends; your enemies will take care of
themselves." By this is meant: Learn well the code of ethics which
governs your profession, and when any man in the guise of friendship
asks you to violate that code, you may say to him, "If you were truly my
friend, you would not ask me to do this any more than you would ask a
physician as a matter of friendship to perform an illegal operation, or
a lawyer to stoop to shyster practices."

Supplying his editors with the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, is the only mission of the reporter, and any man who asks the
reporter to deviate from that principle asks that which is dishonest.

BE TRUE

Thomas Carlyle: To every writer we might say: Be true, if you would be
believed. Let a man but speak forth with genuine earnestness the
thought, the emotion, the actual condition of his own heart; and other
men, so strangely are we all knit together by the tie of sympathy, must
and will give heed to him. In culture, in extent of view, we may stand
above the speaker, or below him; but in either case, his words, if they
are earnest and sincere, will find some response within us; for in spite
of all casual varieties in outward rank or inward, as face answers to
face, so does the heart of man to man.

INSTRUCTIONS TO COPY READERS

The copy reader's position carries with it larger responsibilities than
the position of any other member of the staff. He can mar or ruin a good
story; he can redeem the poor story; he can save the reporter from
errors of commission or omission in the matter of his story or in the
manner of its writing. No matter how accomplished a writer a reporter
may be, the copy reader who handles his story can destroy his product.
Then, too, it is the function of the copy reader, if he believes that a
better story can be written with the same facts as a basis, to suggest
to the city editor that the story be rewritten by the reporter, by
another reporter or by the copy reader himself. Because a man is reading
copy, he should not imagine that he is not to write a story or rewrite
one when occasion demands.

Charles G. Ross writes: "His [the copy reader's] work is critical rather
than creative. It is destructive so far as errors of grammar, violations
of news style and libel are concerned. But if his sense of news is keen,
as that of every copy reader should be, he will find abundant
opportunity for something more than mechanical deletion and
interlineation. He may insert a terse bit of explanation to clear away
obscurity, or may add a piquant touch that will redeem a story from
dullness. To the degree that he edits news with sympathy and
understanding, with a clear perception of news values, his work may be
regarded as creative. If, on the other hand, he conceives it his duty to
reduce all writing to a dead level of mediocrity * * * * he richly
deserves the epithet that is certain to be hurled at the copy reader by
the reporter whose fine phrases have been cut out—he is in truth a
'butcher' of copy."

Dr. Willard G. Bleyer writes: "The reading and editing of copy consists
of (1) correcting all errors whether in expression or in fact; (2)
making the story conform to the style of the newspaper; (3) improving
the story in any respect; (4) eliminating libelous matter; (5) marking
copy for the printer; (6) writing headlines and subheads."

LEARNING THE METIER

Said Robert Louis Stevenson to a painter friend: "You painter chaps make
lots of studies, don't you? And you don't frame them all and send them
to the Salon, do you? You just stick them up on the studio wall for a
bit, and presently you tear them up and make more. And you copy
Velasquez and Rembrandt and Vandyke and Corot; and from each you learn
some little trick of the brush, some obscure little point of technic.
And you know damn well that it is the knowledge thus acquired that will
enable you later on to deliver your own message with a fine and
confident bravado. You are simply learning your metier; and believe me,
mon cher, an artist in any line without the metier is just a blind man
with a stick. Now, in the literary line I am simply doing what you
painter men are doing in the pictorial line—learning the metier."

[7]

PREPARING COPY

Use the typewriter. See that the keys are clean. Use triple space. Write
on one side of the paper. Do not paste sheets together. Leave wide
margins on both sides and at the top. Write your name and a brief
description of the story in two or three words at top of first sheet.
Number sheets. Never write perpendicularly in the margin. Never divide a
word from one page to another, and if possible do not divide a word from
one line to the next. Try to make each page end with a completed
paragraph to aid the composing room in setting the story in "takes."
When necessary to write in long hand, underscore
u
and overscore
n
,
and print proper names and unusual words. Ring periods or write
x
to
stand for them. When there is a chance that a word intentionally
misspelled will be changed by the printer, write
Follow Copy
in the
margin. Indent deeply for paragraphs. Use an end-mark to indicate your
story is completed. Avoid interlining by crossing out the sentence you
desire to correct and writing it again.

Save time for your office by care in writing and editing. A little
thought before setting down a sentence will save you the trouble of
rewriting and the copy reader the annoyance of reading untidy copy.

LEADS

There is generally a better way to begin a story than with
A
,
An
,

The
,
It is
,
There is
,
There are
.

Avoid beginning a story with figures, but when this must be done, then
spell out, as:
Ten thousand men marched away today.

The comprehensive A. P. lead is generally preferable, but in writing
some stories, particularly feature stories, a reporter may find a more
effective lead than the sentence or sentences that summarize the story.

Remember that your reader's time may be limited and that if your story
begins with a striking sentence, arresting either because of what it
says or the manner in which it says it, your story will be read.

THE CUTTLEFISH

He that uses many words for the explaining of any subject doth, like the
cuttlefish, hide himself in his own ink.—Anon.

IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE . . .  A LIGHT SHINING

[8]

HEADS

"The head," says Ross, "is an advertisement, and like all good
advertisements it should be honest, holding out no promise that the
story does not fulfill. It should be based on the facts as set forth in
the story and nothing else."

The head should be a bulletin or summary of the important facts, not a
mere label.

It is usually best to base the head on the lead of the story. The first
deck should tell the most important feature. Every succeeding deck
should contribute new information, not merely explain previous
statements or repeat them in different language.

The function of the head is to tell the facts, not to give the writer's
comment on the facts.

The head for the feature story, the special department, the editorial or
the illustration may properly be a title that suggests the material it
advertises instead of summarizing it. Indeed, the success of a feature
story often depends on its having a head that directs the reader to the
story and arouses his curiosity in it without disclosing the most
interesting content. Head writers should beware of revealing in the head
the surprise of a story, if it has one.

Never turn in a head that you
guess
will fit. Make sure. Heads that
are too long cause delay and confusion.

As a general rule write heads in the present tense.

Principal words should not be repeated. Do not, however, use impossible
synonyms, as
canine
for
dog
or
inn
for
hotel
.

Make every deck complete in itself.

Use articles sparingly. Occasionally they are needed. Observe the
difference in meaning between
King George Takes Little Liquor
and

King George Takes a Little Liquor
.

Avoid such overworked and awkward words as
probe
,
rap
,
quiz
,

Russ
.

Never abbreviate
President
to
Pres.

Avoid ending a line with a preposition, an article or a conjunction, as,

TO MAKE PLANS FOR

AMERICAN DEFENSE

Do not divide phrases, as,

CUT IN SCHEDULE

"K" IS PROBABLE

CAMP PICKS ALL-

AMERICAN TEAM

[9]

Try to make each line of the first deck a unit, as,

POSTOFFICE ROBBED

BY BAND OF TRAMPS

TARIFF BOARD REPORTS

ON ALL WOOL SCHEDULES

STORY OF DYING MAN

REOPENS GRAFT CASE

Observe that in reading these heads there is a natural pause that comes
at the end of the line. The same principle may govern the writing of
three-line heads, as,

ONE GIRL'S ACT

PREVENTS 60,000

FROM WORKING

WAYNE MEN WANT

CANAL TO CONNECT

CITY WITH DETROIT

In the head just written observe that the first line has fewer letters
because it contains two W's and an M. Either an M or a W is equal to a
letter and a half, and an I and a space are each equal to half a letter.
The first line contains 14½ units; the second line contains 15
units; the third line contains 15 units. And yet the first line contains
14 letters and spaces, the second 16, and the third 17.

Every deck should contain a verb, expressed or implied. In this head,

THIEVES BUSY

IN NORTH END

the verb
are
is understood.

If the subject of the verb in the first deck is not written, it should
be the first word of the second deck, as,

INVESTIGATE

WET VICTORY

Texas Senators All Agreed

to Inquire Into Late

Election.

Omit all forms of the verb
to be
whenever possible. This head,

ASKED HOW HE GOT

STOLEN AUTOMOBILE

is more effective than this,

IS ASKED HOW HE GOT

THE STOLEN AUTOMOBILE

[10]
Avoid expressions that are awkward because of omission of some form of
the verb
to be
such as this:

U. S. WEATHER MAN

SAYS SUMMER HERE

Negatives should be avoided. The head should as a rule tell what
happened, not what did not happen.

Avoid the word
may
. The head should as a rule tell what happened, not
what is going to take place, perhaps.

Beware of heads that contain words of double meaning, as,

NURSES HOPE

TO WIN GAME

The word
nurses
may be taken as a noun or a verb.

In this head the first word might be read as a noun or as a verb:

SCOUTS CLAIM KAISER

IS TO BLAME FOR WAR

Use as little punctuation as possible in the first deck.

Avoid alliteration.

Use few abbreviations.

Use figures sparingly.

Insert subheads in long stories at intervals of 150 to 200 words. Use at
least two subheads or none.

When there is a paragraph ending,
The President spoke as follows:
,
place the subhead before this paragraph and not between it and the
quoted matter.

Avoid such makeshift constructions as

M A Y O R WILL

RESIGN, SAID

WILSON WON'T

REPLY, RUMOR

Avoid beginning a head with quotation marks because the white space
destroys the balance of the head. When it is unavoidable, use single
quotation marks.

Avoid heads in which a dash takes the place of
says
, as,

SHIPPING BOARD

MUST GO—WILSON

When this style is necessary, use quotation marks.

It is permissible to make the first deck of a head a quotation without
quotation marks, writing the name of the person quoted in full-face caps
immediately below the deck. One need seldom resort to this expedient.

[11]
Be careful of the present tense in writing of historical events. The
head on a story about the legality of Christ's trial should not read,

JESUS CHRIST IS

ILLEGALLY SLAIN

nor should it read

JESUS CHRIST WAS

ILLEGALLY SLAIN

but it should read

SAYS CHRIST WAS

ILLEGALLY SLAIN

Remember always in writing heads that although a newspaper man seldom
reads more than the first deck, deciding by that whether to read the
story, many readers of the paper read no more than the head, and for
them it should summarize the story, embodying all its salient features.

GRAMMAR

The most common errors in grammar to be found in copy are in:

The agreement of a verb with its subject.

The relation of pronouns to their antecedents.

The position of participles in relation to the words they modify.

The use of co-ordinate conjunctions to connect elements of the same
kind.

The position of correlative conjunctions with relation to the elements
they connect.

To gain grace in writing one must either be born with a natural aptitude
in the use of words—and such men: Stevenson, Poe, Walter Pater and
others, are geniuses—or one must study the writings of these masters of
prose and attempt to discover the secret of their success. It is not
necessary that a good writer should know rules of grammar, but he must
know enough to observe them. A writer may be unable to tell why a
dangling participle is faulty English by testing it with a rule, but he
may nevertheless avoid such a construction because his ear tells him it
is not the best style.

Copies of the best grammars may be found in the office library and
should be consulted when reporters and copy readers are in doubt.

SIMPLICITY

In character, in manners, in style and in all things the supreme
excellence is simplicity.—Longfellow.
[12]

[13]

NOTES

[14]

DICTION

The newspaper writer must beware of two pitfalls in writing: Fine
writing and dialect. Stilted English, pompous and high-sounding, is in
just as bad taste as garish clothing or pungent perfume. Reporters often
give to their stories a wordy and turgid flavor by their refusal to
repeat a word, preferring a synonym. One often sees such sentences as
this: "The policeman took his pistol away as he was about to shoot at
the bluecoat's partner, another officer of the law." This is a quite
unnecessary avoidance of the repetition of the word policeman.

Fine writing is quite out of place at all times in a newspaper and is
particularly obnoxious when a reporter quotes a person of inferior
mentality in polished—or what the reporter thinks are
polished—phrases. Things like this shouldn't get into the paper:
"It
is with poignant grief that I gaze on the torn frame of my dear spouse,"
said Mrs. Sowikicki, as she stood beside a slab in the morgue.

On the other hand reporters should not try to be funny at the expense of
someone inexpert in the use of the language. If a person interviewed
uses bad grammar, correct him when you write the story. To make a person
say
Hadn't ought to of
or
Hain't got no
is not only insulting to
that person and to your readers, but is poor comedy.

Dialect must be absolutely accurate if it is used. Finley Peter Dunne
can write Irish dialect and not many other persons in America can write
as good. Probably no reporter on The News can write it. Dialect that
might hurt the feelings of others who speak the same way should not be
used. In fact as a general rule: DON'T WRITE DIALECT. The greatest
masters of humor, such as Moliere, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Mark Twain,
have obtained their best effects by writing their language
straightforwardly.

THE GRIT OF COMPACT, CLEAR TRUTH

I began to compose by imitating other authors. I admired, and I worked
hard to get, a smooth, rich, classic style. The passion I afterwards
formed for Heine's prose forced me from this slavery, and taught me to
aim at naturalness. I seek now to get back to the utmost simplicity of
expression, to disuse the verbosity I tried so hard to acquire, to get
the grit of compact, clear truth, if possible, informal and direct. It
is very difficult. I should advise any beginner to study the raciest,
strongest, best spoken speech and let the printed speech alone; that is
to say, to write straight from the thought without bothering about the
manner, except to conform to the spirit or genius of the language. I
once thought Latinized diction was to be invited; I now think Latinized
expression is to be guarded against.—W. D. Howells.

[15]

A. P. STYLE

What M. E. Stone says to his correspondents on story writing may be read
with profit by any newspaper man. The following is clipped from the
monthly bulletin issued by the Associated Press to its correspondents:

A plain statement of fact is the best introduction to a news story. A
simple, direct style—which does not mean a wooden style—is always
desirable. In the opening sentence it is of particular value.

The news which a story contains is the one thing which entitles it to
place in the Associated Press report. It is the news, not the manner of
telling the news, on which the story must stand. It is therefore
essential to present the vital point at the outset, in such form as will
enable the reader to grasp it quickly, clearly and easily. For this
purpose there is no acceptable substitute for plain English.

In an effort to make the most vivid and emphatic impression at the
opening, objectionable forms of construction often are employed. A
highly-colored or strained introduction almost always fails of its
purpose of enlisting interest at once, since it tends to divert the
attention of the reader from the subject-matter of the story to the
writer's manner of telling it. This renders the introduction cloudy and
lessens interest instead of stimulating it. Once the main point is
established, the well known rules of news writing should be observed.

To say that "'William Brown may obtain a fair trial in Greene County,'
Judge Smith so ruled today," is to misstate the facts. It places the
Associated Press on record as making a statement made by the court. Use
of this and similar introductory sentences which require subsequent
qualification is objectionable.

Opening sentences frequently lose directness and clearness because of
the effort to crowd too much into them. All that is essential is to
cover the vital point, leaving details for subsequent narration.

Introductions must be impartial. It is possible to take almost any given
set of statements and present them in such a way as to convey any one of
several shades of meaning. This may depend merely on the order of
presentation. Associated Press stories must be accurate and accuracy
involves not only the truthfulness of individual statements but the
co-relation of these statements in such a way as to convey to the reader
a fair and unbiased impression of the story as a whole. An account of a
court proceeding, a political debate, or any other event which involves
conflicting claims or interests, should not be introduced by singling
out a particular phase of the story which is limited to one side of the
controversy, simply because that is the most striking feature. Such a
form of introduction
[16]
tends to place the emphasis on one side of the
case, giving bias to the entire story.

Stereotyped introductions should be avoided. One of the most common is
the "When" introduction, as: "Two men were killed when a train struck
. . . " etc. "If" and "After" often are used similarly. Inverted sentences
are also frequent; as "That the prisoner was guilty was the opinion
expressed by . . . " etc. Constant employment of these fixed styles becomes
monotonous. Moreover, it is possible to state the facts more simply,
directly and effectively without them.

BROADEN THE VOCABULARY

Edward Harlan Webster gives this excellent advice on how to broaden the
vocabulary:

Practice is the first aid. Actually get hold of new words and then use
them. You will perceive that you will not startle others so much as
yourself. Gradually the words will begin to assume a standing in your
vocabulary, and before long, they will seem like old friends.

To obtain these words, various practical methods are possible. Here are
a few:

1. Find synonyms for words which you have a tendency to overuse.

2. Record words with which you are familiar but you never use—and then
"work" them.

3. Make a list of important, unfamiliar words which you hear, or
discover in your reading.

4. Listen carefully to the conversations or addresses of educated
people.

5. If possible, try to translate from a foreign language. In this way a
fine perception of shades of meaning, almost unattainable by any other
method, is acquired.

6. Get interested in the dictionary, where you can trace the life
history of words.

THE PICTORIAL POWER OF WORDS

"Words have a considerable share in exciting ideas of beauty—they
affect the mind by raising in it ideas of those things for which custom
has appointed them to stand. Words, by their original and pictorial
power have great influence over the passions; if we combine them
properly, we may give new life and beauty to the simplest object. In
painting, we may represent any fine figure we please, but we never can
give it those enlivening touches which it may receive from words. For
example, we can represent an angel in a picture by drawing a young man
winged: but what painting can furnish out anything so grand as the
addition of one word—'the angel of the Lord'? Is there any painting
more grand and beautiful?"—Edmund Burke.

[17]

adjectives, adverbs and interjections—are to be capitalized, no matter
how short; thus: "The Man Who Would Be King." Other parts of
speech—that is, prepositions, conjunctions and articles—are to be

[21]

NOTES

[22]

PUNCTUATION

A series of three or more words takes commas except before conjunctions,
as:
There were boxes of guns, bayonets, cartridges and

bandages.

Separate members of the series with semicolons if there are commas
within the phrase, as:
There were boxes of guns, bayonets and
cartridges; casks of powder, high explosives and chemicals; and many
other prohibited articles
.

Use asterisks to indicate that part of quoted matter has been omitted,
as,
He said: "I favor all measures that * * * will help the people."

Use leaders to indicate a pause in the thought.

He said he would never return . . . . . .

When the news reached his mother, she fainted.

Commas set off an explanatory phrase but not a restrictive phrase of
inclusive qualification. One writes: Poe, a poet of America, wrote "The
Raven." But one writes: Poe the poet is a finer craftsman than Poe the
fiction writer.

Use commas before conjunctions in a sentence made up of separate
clauses, each with its own subject nominative, as,
The horse is old,
but it is still willing
. If the same subject, write it:
The horse is
old but willing
.

Use no period after letters used in place of numbers, as,
B Company
.
(Companies of soldiers are designated as
B Company
, not
Company B
.)

Use hyphen and no apostrophe when dates are joined, as,
1861-65
.

Write the
caliber
of a revolver or rifle with a period, as
.22
.

Use no commas in years and street numbers, as,
1904
, not
1,904
; and

2452 High street
. But write:
2,156 persons
and
$1,560
.

Follow this style in date lines: CHICAGO, May 10.—

BROWNSVILLE, Mich., May 10.—

Avoid this form as hackneyed:
His wealth (?) has disappeared.

Place a comma or a colon after
said
,
remarked
and similar words when
quoted matter follows.

THREE RULES

Writes the Duke of Argyll: I have always held that clear thinking will
find its own expression in clear writing. As to mere technical rules,
there are very few that occur to me, except such as these—first, to aim
at short sentences, without involution or parenthetical matter; second,
to follow a logical order in construction of sentences, and in the
sequence of them; third, to avoid absolutely such phrases as "the
former" and "the latter," always preferring repetition to the use of
such tiresome references. The last rule, and in some measure the other,
I learned from Macaulay, and have found it of immense use. There is some
mannerism in his style, but it is always clear as crystal, and this rule
of repetition contributed much to this.

[23]

QUOTATIONS

Quotation marks are not needed when matter is indented, thus:
The
speaker said in part
:

I do not believe that, etc.

Sometimes marks of punctuation belong inside quotation marks and
sometimes outside, as: "
Did you hear him say, 'I am here'?
" But in
this case: "
I heard him say, 'Are you here?'
" Continental usage
permits this form: "
Are you shot!?
" but it is not in good use on this
side.

Use no quotation marks with slang of your own writing.

Use no quotes in writing testimony with question and answer. This is the
style:

Q.—What is your name?

A.—John Jones.

Observe the style on quotes within quotes:
The witness said: "I asked
him, 'Where is my copy of "Paradise Lost"?'"

OBSERVATION

Writes Arnold Bennett: One is curious about one's fellow-creatures:
therefore one watches them. And generally the more intelligent one is,
the more curious one is, and the more one observes. The mere
satisfaction of this curiosity is in itself a worthy end, and would
alone justify the business of systemized observation. But the aim of
observation may, and should, be expressed in terms more grandiose. Human
curiosity counts among the highest social virtues (as indifference
counts among the basest defects), because it leads to a disclosure of
the causes of character and temperament and thereby to a better
understanding of the springs of human conduct. Observation is not
practiced directly with this high end in view (save by prigs and other
futile souls); nevertheless it is a moral act and must inevitably
promote kindliness—whether we like it or not. It also sharpens the
sense of beauty. An ugly deed—such as a deed of cruelty—takes on
artistic beauty when its origin and hence its fitness in the general
scheme begin to be comprehended. In the perspective of history we can
derive esthetic pleasure from the tranquil scrutiny of all kinds of
conduct—as well, for example, of a Renaissance Pope as of a Savonarola.
Observation endows our day and our street with the romantic charm of
history, and stimulates charity—not the charity which signs cheques,
but the more precious charity which puts itself to the trouble of
understanding. The condition is that the observer must never lose sight
of the fact that what he is to see is life, is the woman next door, is
the man in the train—and not a concourse of abstractions. To appreciate
all this is the first inspiring preliminary to sound observation.

[24]

NOUNS

Watch for nouns ending in
-ics
. Many of them are singular, such as

politics
,
mathematics
,
ethics
.

Make sums of money singular:
Five dollars was spent
, unless individual
pieces of money are meant, as:
Five silver dollars were placed on the
table
. Write
moneys
, not
monies
.

Remember that
data
,
memoranda
,
phenomena
,
paraphernalia
,

bacteria
and
strata
are plural.

Distinguish between
majority
and
plurality
.
Majority
means the
lead of a candidate over
all other
candidates.
Plurality
means the
lead of a candidate over
one other
candidate.

Event
,
incident
,
affair
,
occurrence
,
happening
,
circumstance

do not mean the same things. Look them up.

Use
preventive
, not
preventative
.

Distinguish between
ambassador
,
minister
,
consul
,
envoy
.

Avoid feminine forms of such words as
author
,
artist
,
dancer
,

violinist
,
pianist
,
poet
. It may be necessary occasionally to
change more than the spelling. For example,
the world's greatest
pianiste
may not mean
the world's greatest pianist
.

Prefer motorist to automobilist and autoist.

Sewer
is a drain.
Sewage
is what goes through it.
Sewerage
is a
system of drains.

Don't use
divine
as a noun.

Don't write
couple
unless you mean two things joined and not merely
two.

Don't write
party
for
person
, nor
people
for
persons
.

Don't use
citizens
when you mean simply
persons
.

Don't write
a large per cent of
when speaking of persons when you mean

a large proportion
.

When nouns are attended by participles, two constructions are possible.
One may say either
I know of John's being there
, or
I know of John
being there
;
The fact of the battle's having been lost
, or
The fact
of the battle having been lost
. The possessive is to be preferred with
proper names and in most simple constructions; it is
altogether to be
preferred with pronouns
when the principal idea is in the participle.
One says:
I saw him going
,
I heard them singing
; but
I heard of his
going
;
I urged his going
;
I advised their attending
;
I objected to
his staying
;
I opposed their going
;
the fact of his being there made
a difference
;
On his saying this the people shouted
;
With their
consenting the thing was settled
;
He spoke of my setting out as
already agreed to
;
He found fault with our accepting the place
, etc.

[25]
Collective nouns are usually singular, as,
The club has increased its
membership
. However, a collective noun, when it is used to refer more
particularly to individuals than to the mass, is plural, as
The crowd
was orderly
, but,
The crowd threw up their hats
. In using collective
nouns beware of mixing the number. Do not write,
The audience was in
their seats
, but
The audience was seated
, or
The audience were in
their seats
.

PREFER

Station to depot

House or home to residence

Woman to lady

Man to gentleman

Telephone to phone

Automobile to auto

Motor car to motor

Bridegroom to groom

Rest to balance

THE JOURNALIST'S CREED

By WALTER WILLIAMS

I believe in the profession of journalism.

I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected
with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for
the public; that acceptance of lesser service than the public service is
betrayal of this trust.

I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness
are fundamental to good journalism.

I believe that a journalist should write only what he holds in his heart
to be true.

I believe that suppression of the news for any consideration other than
the welfare of society is indefensible.

I believe that no one should write as a journalist what he would not say
as a gentleman; that bribery by one's own pocketbook is as much to be
avoided as bribery by the pocketbook of another; that individual
responsibility may not be escaped by pleading another's instruction or
another's dividends.

I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike
serve the best interests of the readers; that a single standard of
helpful truth and clearness should prevail for all; that the supreme
test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

I believe that the journalism which succeeds best—and best deserves
success—fears God and honors man; is stoutly independent, unmoved by
pride of opinion or greed of power; constructive, tolerant, but never
careless; self controlled, patient; always respectful of its readers,
but always unafraid; is quickly indignant at injustice; is unswayed by
the appeal of privilege or the clamor of the mob; seeks to give every
man a chance and, as far as law and honest wages and recognition of
human brotherhood can make it so, an equal chance; is profoundly
patriotic, while sincerely promoting international good will and
cementing world comradeship; is a journalism of humanity, of and for
today's world.

[26]

NOTES

[27]

PRONOUNS

Never use
I
in referring to yourself except in a signed article.

Avoid the use of
he or she
and
his or her
. The use of either phrase
is seldom required for clearness' sake. When a noun is used which may
refer indifferently to both sexes, the accepted practice is to use the
masculine pronoun. For example, say:
Let the teacher do his duty and he
need not fear criticism
, not
Let the teacher do his or her duty and he
or she need not fear criticism
.

Similarly after indefinite singulars like
each
,
every
,
somebody
,

anybody
, use the masculine singular pronoun. Thus,
Everyone should do
his duty and he should do it every day
. Here one is not only to avoid
the use of
he or she
and
his or her
, but also particularly and
constantly to be on guard against
they
and
their
. Sentences like

Nobody knows what they can do till they try
;
Everyone is urged to
come and bring their pocketbooks with them
, are frequently heard and
often get into print.

Do not use
the same
for a third personal or a demonstrative pronoun.

The farmer brought a load of wheat to town and sold it
(not
the
same
)
at the mill
.

Do not make
such
a pronoun, except in the phrase
such as
.
He has
fruits of all sorts and his prices for such are unreasonable
, is the
sort of use to be avoided.

Distinguish between
its
, possessive pronoun, and
it's
, contraction
of
it is
.

Use
either
or
neither
only of two,
any one
or
none
of more than
two, as:
In one group are Russia, Germany and Austria, in another
France and England. Any one of the first group acting with either of the
second could determine the question
. (As conjunctions,
either
and

neither
may introduce the first of a series of particulars consisting
of three or more. It is correct to say
Neither this nor that nor the
other thing
; but when used as pronouns,
either
and
neither
should
be rigidly confined to use with reference to two only.)

Prefer always
no one
and
nobody
to
not any one
or
not anybody
,
as
It is no one's
(or
nobody's
)
business
, not,
It is not any
one's
(or
not anybody's
)
business
.

Do not use
apiece
for
each
of persons. Say:
The men each took an
apple
or
took an apple each
, not
The men took an apple apiece
. But
they might have bought the apples at so much
apiece
.

Be careful not to say
these sort of things
,
these kind of men
, for

this sort of things
or
this kind of men
.

In questions direct or indirect be careful to use
whom
when the
objective
[28]
case is required. Do not say,
Who did you see there?
or,
I
do not know who he meant
.

The relative
who
should be used only of persons (or of beasts or
things personified). Do not say:
The dog whom you saw
or
He drove the
horse who made the best record
. The relative
which
should be used
only of beasts and inanimate objects. Do not say:
The women and
children which were numerous then came trooping in
.

The relative
that
may be used regardless of gender and the antecedent.

That
should be used after a compound antecedent mentioning both
persons and animals or things, as,
The soldiers, the ambulances and the
pack mules that were recaptured, were sent to the rear
.

Be careful of the case of
who
if a parenthetical sentence intervenes
between it and its verb.
He said that Gen. Harrison, whom, everybody
well knew, had long been interested in the case, would make the closing
argument.
Such faulty objective is often heard in daily speech and not
infrequently gets into the papers. Of course
who
should be used. But

whom
should be used when the infinitive follows:
He said that Gen.
Harrison, whom everybody admitted to be profoundly versed in the law,
would discuss the point
.

It is proper to omit the relative pronoun on occasion when it is the
object of the following verb, as
He was among the men (whom) I saw
.

CONJUNCTIONS

Never use
like
as a conjunction. John may look
like
James or act

like
James or speak
like
James, but he never looks, acts or speaks

like
James looks, acts or speaks; he never looks
like
he wanted to
do something, nor conducts himself
like
he thought he owned the earth,
or
like
he was crazy.
Like
(as in the first example) may be followed
by an objective case of a substantive, with which the construction is
completed:
You are like me in this
;
You, like me, believe this
;
He
conducted himself like a crazy man
. When a clause is demanded,
as if

should be used:
He looks as if he wanted something
;
he acts as if he
were crazy
.

Do not use
if
for
whether
in introducing indirect questions:
I
doubt whether
(not
if
)
this is true
;
I asked whether
(not
if
)

he would go
.

Do not use
as
for
that
. Not
I do not know as this is so
, but
I do
not know that this is so
.

Do not use
without
for
unless
.
We cannot go unless
(not
without
)

he comes
.

Do not use
but what
for
but that
or
that
.
I do not doubt that

(or
but that
)
he will come
, not
but what he will come
;
They did
not know but that
(not
but what
)
they might accept it
.

Do not use
while
for
although
, as,
while it is probable
.
While

refers to time.

[29]

VERBS

The verb should agree with its subject in person and number. It ought
not to be necessary to give this obvious rule, but hardly a day passes
without violation of it in almost every paper. Its violation is
especially common in the inverted sentence, introduced with
there
.

There is likely to be some changes
;
There is, at the present writing,
some hopes of peace
;
There seems to be, in view of all the conditions,
many objections to this plan
, are examples of the faulty usage.

The
to
should not be separated from the infinitive by word or phrase.
The modifier should precede the
to
or follow the verb. Do not say
to
promptly act
, but
to act promptly
or
promptly to act
. Such use as
in the example just given is bad enough, but it is not so offensive as
the intrusion of time adverbs and negatives as, for example,
He decided
to now go
, or
He expected to not only go but to stay
, or
He
preferred to not stay
.

Do not end a sentence with the
to
of an omitted infinitive; as:
He
could not speak but tried to
; but
He refused to go but he ought to
go
, or
He ought to go but he refuses
.

Subordinate infinitives and participles take their time from the verb in
the principal clause. They should therefore be the simple so-called
present forms. Do not say:
I intended to have gone
, or
I intended
having gone
, but
I intended to go
,
I intended going
; not
He had
expected to have been present
, but
He had expected to be present
; not

He would have liked to have seen you
; but
He would have liked to see
you
; not
I was desirous to have gone
, but
I was desirous to go
.

With the verbs
appear
(in the sense of
seem to be
) and
feel
,

look
,
smell
and
sound
(used intransitively) use an adjective and
not an adverb, i. e.,
The rose smells sweet
;
Miss Coghlan as Lady
Teazle looked charming
;
She appeared happy
. But
appear
in the same
sense of
behave
is followed by an adverb, as
He appears well
; and
the other verbs used transitively of course take an adverb, as
He
looked sharply at the man
.

When one wishes to imply doubt or denial in a condition of present or
indefinite time, the imperfect subjunctive should be used, as
If the
book were here, I should show you
—but the book is not here;
If it
were true, you would long ago have heard it
—but it is not true. But if
one is referring to past time, the imperfect indicative must be used,
as,
If he was here yesterday, I did not know it
.

Be careful to distinguish between
lay
and
lie
,
raise
and
rise
,

set
and
sit
. The first of each pair is transitive, and always
requires an object; the second is intransitive and never takes an
object. (The only exception is
sit
used of a
[30]
rider, as,
He sits his
horse well
.) One
lays
or
sets
a thing down and
raises
it up. One

lies
or
sits
down and
rises
from one's place. Land
lies
this way
or that. (But we speak of the
lay
of the land.)

Especially pains must be taken to keep straight the past tenses and past
participles of
lay
and
lie
. Of
lay
past tense and participle are
alike
laid
.
He laid
or
he has laid the case before the
authorities
. The past tense of
lie
is
lay
(the same as the present
tense of the transitive verb), the past participle is
lain
.
These forms are seldom if ever used for parts of
lay
; but for them

laid
is very often used, as,
He laid
or
he has laid down to take a
nap
, where the correct usage is
He lay
or
he has lain down
, etc.

Prices
rise
, wages
rise
, bread
rises
, bread is
set
to
rise
;
men
raise
prices or wages;
He rose and raised his hand
. Clothing of
every sort
sits
well or ill, it does not
set
. The corresponding
noun, however, is
set
;
He admired the set of the garment
. You
set

a hen, but the hen
sits
and is a
sitting
hen. The heavenly bodies

set
, but that is another word, which means to
sink
or to
settle
.

Inanimate objects are not
injured
but
damaged
.

Use
wish
to mean simple desire, as,
I wish to see him
. Use
want
to
mean acute need, as,
I want food
.

Only moving objects
collide
. Two automobiles may
collide
, but an
automobile does not
collide
with a fence.

DOUBLING UP HAVE'S

Mark Twain in "A Tramp Abroad" wrote: "Harris said that if the best
writer in the world once got the slovenly habit of 'doubling up his
have's,' he could never get rid of it; that is to say, if a man gets the
habit of saying 'I should have liked to have known more about it'
instead of saying 'I should have liked to know more about it,' his
disease is incurable."

NOTES

[33]

ADVERBS

Great liberty may be exercised in placing the adverb according to the
emphasis desired. In general it should be placed near the word or phrase
it modifies to express the thought most clearly. One should not say,

Not only he spoke forcefully but eloquently
; nor
He was rather
forceful than eloquent
, but
He was forceful rather than eloquent
.

Note particularly that when the adverb is placed within the verb, it
should regularly follow the first auxiliary. For example:
This can

truthfully be said
, not
This can be truthfully said
;
He will

probably have set out by noon
, not
He will have probably
, etc.;
It

has long been expected
, not
It has been long expected
.

If the adverb is intended to modify the whole sentence, it very properly
stands first, as,
Decidedly, this is not true
;
Assuredly, he does not

mean that
. In such sentences the adverb really modifies some verb
understood, as,
I say decidedly this is not true
.

Do not use
this
,
that
and
some
as adverbs. Never say
this high
,

this long
,
that broad
,
that good
,
this much
,
that much
,
some
better
,
some earlier
. Say
thus
or
so
whenever tempted to use

this
or
that
in such connections, and use
somewhat
instead of

some
.

Do not say a man is
dangerously ill
; say
alarmingly
or
critically
.
Never use
illy
; you might as well say
welly
.

After a negative use
so
in a comparison.
This is as good as that
,
but
This is not so good as that
.

Say
as far as
,
as long as
, etc.; not
so far as
,
so long as
.
Thus,
As far as I know, this is true
;
As long as I stay here, you may

use my book
.

Use
previously to
,
agreeably to
,
consistently with
, etc., instead
of the adjective forms, in such expressions as
Previously to my

arrival, he had been informed
;
We acted agreeably to the

instructions
.

Beware of
only
. Better not use it unless you are sure it is correctly
placed. Observe the difference in the meaning here: I have
only
spoken
to him. I have spoken
only
to him.

Don't use
liable
when you mean
likely
. A man is
likely
to park his
automobile so he will be
liable
to arrest.

Don't use
painfully cut
and similar expressions. One is not

pleasantly cut
.

Occasionally
means
on occasion
. So don't write
very occasionally
,
but
very seldom
or
infrequently
.

Farther
is used to denote distance;
further
in other senses, as,
I
told him further that I walked farther than he
.

[34]

ADJECTIVES

Be sparing in the use of epithets and of adjectives and adverbs
generally. Especially avoid the use of superlatives. Superlatives are
seldom true. Rarely is a man the most remarkable man in the country in
any particular; rarely is an accident the worst in the history of the
city. Better understate than overstate; better err on the side of
moderation than excess. William Cobbett says: "Some writers deal in
expletives to a degree that tires the ear and offends the understanding.
With them everything is excessively, or immensely, or extremely, or
vastly, or surprisingly, or wonderfully, or abundantly, or the like. The
notion of such writers is that these words give strength to what

they
are saying. This is a great error. Strength must be found
in the thought or it will never be found in the words. Big sounding
words, without thoughts corresponding, are effort without effect."

Be sure to remember that
nee
means born. It is of course impossible
then to speak of
Mrs. Doe, nee Mary Roe
, as one is never born with a
Christian name, but
Mrs. Doe, nee Roe
. And, of all things when a widow
has remarried, do not write
Mrs. Richard Roe, nee Mrs. John Doe
.

Adjectives, if wisely used, give desirable color to a story. A thesaurus
will brighten up a reporter's adjectival vocabulary. These are
suggestions for possible substitutions of fresh words for more or less
hackneyed words:

fast
—
fleet
,
swift

good
—
meritorious
,
laudable

repentant
—
penitent
,
contrite

temperate
—
abstemious

intemperate
—
penitent
,
contrite

modest
—
decorous

distressing
—
piteous
,
pitiable
,
rueful

witty
—
jocose
,
nimble-witted

fearful
—
timid
,
apprehensive
,
tremulous

crafty
—
cunning
,
artful

frank
—
ingenuous
,
guileless

Prefer
agreeable
to
nice
, which means accurate; and
long
to

lengthy
.

Words like
perfect
and
unique
cannot be compared. Never write,
more
perfect
,
most perfect
,
most unique
.

Eschew the word
very
. It seldom strengthens a sentence.

It is better to use such words as
feline
,
bovine
,
canine
,
human

as adjectives only.

Prefer
several
or
many
to
a number of
.

[35]
Healthy
means possessing health, as,
a healthy man
.
Healthful

means conducive to health, as,
healthful climate
,
surroundings
,

employment
. Do not use
healthful
in speaking of food, but

wholesome
.

Parlous
is archaic. Don't use the phrase
in these parlous times
. The
word in good usage is
perilous
.

Nobody has explained the difference between
actual photographs
and

photographs
.

Awful
means inspiring
awe
,
fearful
inspiring
fear
, and

terrible
inspiring
terror
.

Anxious
implies
anxiety
. Say
eager
if you mean it.

The first meaning of
hectic
is habitual. The second meaning is

fevered
. It connotes
heat
more particularly than
red
.

Great care is needed
in
using these three words:
livid
,
lurid

and
weird
.
Livid
means primarily black and blue. It also means a
grayish blue or lead color, as flesh by contusion. It doesn't mean
anything else.
Lurid
means a pale yellow,
ghastly pale, wan; figuratively it means gloomy or dismal, grimly
terrible or sensational. When used in its first sense it is properly
applicable to the yellow flames seen through smoke. It does not mean
fiery red. In its figurative sense it can be used to describe a series
of incidents calculated to shock or to stun by the enormity of them.

Weird
means primarily pertaining to witchcraft and is used in
reference to the witches in "Macbeth." It also means unearthly, uncanny,
eerie. A green light might be called
weird
. It must not be used to
mean peculiar, as,
She wore a weird hat
.

YOUR AUDIENCE

Says Irvin S. Cobb: I'd rather have my work read by thousands of people
throughout the country than be the author of the greatest classic that
ever mouldered on a shelf.

In my opinion, the masses are worth our art. If we believe in a
democratic form of government we should believe in a democratic attitude
toward the art of the short story, and I, for one, frankly admit that I
write for the shop girl and business man rather than for the high-brow
critic. That does not mean you must necessarily choose between them, but
if I had to choose I would let the critic go.

DEFENDER OF CIVIL LIBERTY . . .  STRENGTHENER
OF LOYALTY . . .  PILLAR AND STAY OF DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT.

[36]

NOTES

[37]

PREPOSITIONS

Be careful to use the proper prepositions in all connections.

Say
different from
, not
different to
.

We say a man lives
on
, not
in
, a street, an avenue, etc. Children
play
in
the street, but
on
the pavement.

One writes
under
, not
over
, a signature. The preposition has no
reference to the place of the signature.

Do not overwork
on the part of
. This phrase is often used where
by

or
among
is to be preferred, as,
Much patriotism is displayed on the
part of the Greeks
.

Say
off
, not
off from
or
off of
.
He fell off his horse
, or
He
fell from his horse
.

Discriminate carefully between
beside
and
besides
. The first is
always a preposition and means either
by the side of
, as,
He stood
beside me
, or
aside from
, or
out of
, as,
This is beside our
present purpose
;
He was beside himself for joy
.
Besides
is either
preposition or adverb: as the former it means
in addition to
, as

Several others were present besides those you saw
; as adverb it means

moreover
or
more than that
, as
There were, besides, many pompous
volumes
.

Be careful with
between
and
among
;
between
is used with reference
to two persons, parties or things;
among
with reference to many:
In
this city Democrats and Republicans divide the offices between them; in
some cities they are distributed among all the parties
.

Distinguish between
in
and
into
.
Into
implies action. A man goes

into
his house and then he is
in
the house.

A person dies
of
typhoid fever rather than
from
typhoid fever.

Distinguish between
consist in
and
consist of
. Virtue consists
in

right living. The family consists
of
seven persons.

A book is illustrated
with
sketches and it is illustrated
by
the
artist who made the sketches.

Omit
from
from the phrases
from hence
,
from thence
,
from whence
.

MIRROR OF THE PUBLIC MIND . . .  INTERPRETER
OF THE PUBLIC INTENT . . .  TROUBLER OF THE
PUBLIC CONSCIENCE.

[38]

ARTICLES

Use an article with every noun of a series unless the nouns are so
closely related that one concept is implied. Say,
The bread and jam was
good
, but
The bread and the jam were good
. Say,
A horse and buggy
,
but
A man and a woman
.

Do not repeat an article before each adjective of a series when all
modify the same noun. Say,
A red, white and blue flag
. If you mean
three flags, say,
A red, a white, and a blue flag
.

Do not write
a
or
an
after
sort of
and
kind of
. Make it:
He is
the right sort of man for mayor
.

The definite article is used too often when it might better be omitted,
as in this sentence:
The study of the dictionary is helpful
. Write it:

Study of the dictionary
.

NUMBERS

The general rule on The News is that all numbers above nine shall be
written in figures, and that all numbers below 10 shall be spelled out.
There are, of course, many exceptions to this rule. Figures are always
used for degrees of latitude and longitude, degrees of temperature, per
cent, prices, racing time, scores, definite sums of money, time, votes,
dates (as Sept. 27), ages, street numbers and tabulated statistics.

Spell out indefinite figures, as
about a dollar's worth
.

Use Roman numerals in writing of kings, as
George V
, and then without
a period. Do not use Roman numerals in designating centuries. Write it

fourteenth century
, not
XIVth century
.

Write
Monday at 8 a. m.
, not
at 8 o'clock on Monday morning
.

Spell out such expressions as
the early seventies
.

Use figures in dimensions when written thus:
a lot 4×6
feet
.

All ages shall be written thus:
John Smith, 8 years old
. Do not write
it:
John Smith, aged 8
, or
aged eight
. It will be easy to remember
the rule if you observe that in writing it thus:
John Smith, aged 18,
48 Jones street
, you are opening an opportunity for an error easily
made. It may appear:
John Smith, aged 184, 8 Jones street
.

All ordinals are spelled out. Write it
thirtieth
, not
30th
. Write a
date:
Feb. 6
, not
February 6th
, or
February sixth
.

Do not use both numerals and figures spelled out in one phrase. Write
it:
Eight feet eleven inches
. If in a phrase a number over 10 precedes
a number under 10, express both in figures, thus
18 hours 4 minutes
.
If vice versa, express it thus:
two hours eighteen minutes
.

The metric system is the system of measurement of which the meter is the
fundamental unit. It was first adopted in France and is now in general
use in most civilized countries except the English-speaking countries.
The system is now used throughout the world for scientific measurements.
Its use was legalized in the United States in 1866.

The meter, the unit of length, was intended to be one ten-millionth part
of the earth's meridian quadrant and is nearly so. Its length is 39.370
inches. The unit of surface is the are, which is 100 square meters. The
theoretical unit of volume is the stere, which is a cubic meter. The
unit of volume for the purposes of the market is the liter, which is the
volume of one kilogram of distilled water at its maximum density and is
intended to be one cubic decimeter. For 10 times,
[41]
100 times, 1,000
times and 10,000 times one of these units, the prefixes, deca-, hecto-,
kilo- and myria- are used. For 1-10, 1-100 and 1-1,000 of the units,
the prefixes deci-, centi- and milli- are used.

In this table the equivalents are measures common in the United States
and are not to be confused with British measures, which in some cases
vary slightly.

NAMES AND TITLES

The one infallible way to insult a man is to misspell his name; that is
an old newspaper maxim. More care should be taken with the spelling of
the names in a story than with any other mechanical detail. Often a name
is misspelled because a typewriter is not clean and an
e
or an
a
is
mistaken for an
o
or a
u
. It is wise for the reporter to make sure
these letters particularly print clearly or he may be held to account
for an error. An even better way is to write a proper name in CAPS if it
is at all uncommon. When the reporter writes a name such as Willson or
Jonnes or Georg, a name which deviates slightly from a familiar name, it
is wise to write it thus ". . .
and Georg (Correct) Brandes who . . .
"
then the copy reader knows that the reporter has not left off a letter
and the printer and proof reader also know that the word must stand as
written.

All proper names should be looked up in the directory, dictionary or
encyclopedia unless the reporter or copy reader is sure of the spelling.
To misspell a man's name shakes that man's faith in the newspaper; leads
him to believe that if the newspaper can't write his name correctly, it
is likely to make other mistakes.

Never use
Mr.
before a man's Christian name. Give his full name and
then speak of him thereafter as Mr. Blank. Do not write: Mr. John J.
Blank.

Do not quote familiar nicknames, such as Billy Sunday, Ty Cobb, Sam
Crawford, Jim Corbett.

Do not write: Superintendent of Police Marquardt, but Supt. Marquardt,
or Ernst Marquardt, superintendent of police.

Never refer to a woman, no matter how lowly her social position, as "the
Smith woman." Call her Mrs. Smith or Miss Smith.

Do not use the title
professor
unless the person spoken of is or was a
member of a college or university faculty. Because a man is a principal
of a high school, a mesmerist or the trainer of sea lions, he is not for
that reason entitled to call himself Prof. Blank.

Do not use name handles, such as
Butcher Smith
,
Grocer Jones
.

Do not use
master
in referring to a boy.

Write
Mr. and Mrs. James Smith
, not
James Smith and wife.

Do not write Mrs. Judge Smith, or Mrs. Dr. Jones.

Use the indefinite article, as
Frank Smith, a plumber
;
William Jones,
a barber
. Use the definite article in naming persons of distinction, as

William Dean Howells, the writer
;
Sarah Bernhardt, the actress
.

The surname is written first among the Chinese.
Sun Yat Sen
is
Dr.
Sun
.
Li Hung Chang
is
Mr. Li
. Chinese is a monosyllabic language
and all names should be written with each syllable capitalized, but
hyphens are used with geographical names, as,
Yang-Tse-Kiang
,

Ho-Hang-Ho
, except
Pekin
,
[46]

Nankin
,
Shanghai
,
Hankow
and

Canton
. Drop unnecessary letters in Chinese names whenever possible,
as
Pekin(g)
,
Yuan Shi(h) Kai
,
Ho(w)-Hang-Ho
.

Write a man's name as he writes it. It is not
A. H. Frazer
; it is not

Allan Frazer
; but
Allan H. Frazer
. It is not
F. H. Croul
or
Frank
Croul
, but
Frank H. Croul
.

It is the King of the Belgians, not the King of Belgium.

Writing of a knight, be sure that you use his first name with the title

Sir
. He is
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
, not
Sir Conan Doyle
. Never
write
Sir Doyle
. The wife of a knight, however, is addressed as
Lady
Blank
, not necessarily
Lady Mary Blank
.

JEW AND HEBREW

The proper use of the words "Hebrew" and "Jew" has been explained by the
American Jewish Committee, as follows: "Although no hard and fast rules
can be laid down, the word 'Hebrew' has come to have a purely racial
connotation. It refers to a race and to the language of that race. Thus
we hear of a 'Hebrew Christian,' meaning a person of Hebrew descent who
has been raised in or adopted the Christian religion. The word 'Jew,'
although often used for denoting a member of the Hebrew race without
reference to religion or nationality, has come, in the best usage, to
have two restricted meanings—a national and a religious meaning. It
used to mean a person who was a subject of the Kingdom of Judah, in the
southern part of Palestine, and later it was also applied to those who
were subjects of the northern Kingdom of Israel. Under Roman domination
Palestine was called 'Judea' and its inhabitants 'Jews.' The word Jew
has the same sense now among those who believe that the dispersion of
the Jewish people and the fact that they possess no territory of their
own has not deprived them of their character as a nation or nationality.
The other meaning of 'Jew' is any one who professes the religious
principles laid down in the Old Testament as interpreted in the Talmud.
Thus, a Gentile who adopts the Jewish faith may be called a Jew, but may
not be called a Hebrew, because he does not descend from that sub-class
of the Semitic race from which the Hebrews are reputed to come. Up to
the last quarter of the nineteenth century the Jews rarely applied the
term 'Jew' to themselves, as it was used as a term of opprobrium and as
a contemptuous epithet. The Jews preferred to call themselves 'Hebrews'
or 'Israelites.' Since about 1880, however, the Jewish people have come
to adopt this name more and more generally, and it has begun to lose its
derogatory meaning. The word 'Jew' is always a noun, and its use as an
adjective in such cases as 'Jew boy' and 'Jew peddler,' etc., is as
ungrammatical as it is vulgar."

Don't use
Jew
as a verb, as,
I jewed him down to a dollar
.

NOTES

[48]

CHURCH TITLES

Writing of clergymen, follow this style:
the Rev. Dr. John J. Blank
,

Dr. Blank
, the
Rev. Mr. Blank
. Never
Rev. Blank
or
the Rev.
Blank
.

Bishops of the Catholic, Anglican or Episcopal communions use the prefix

Right Reverend
, abbreviated
Rt. Rev.

Bishops of the Methodist church NEVER use the prefix
Rt. Rev.
They
make no claim to apostolic succession. The usage of Methodism is to
write, for example, "Bishop Theodore Somers Henderson, of the Methodist
Episcopal area of Detroit."

In the Methodist church an episcopal division is denominated, Area; in
the Catholic and Anglican communions, Diocese.

Deans of the Catholic and Anglican churches use the prefix
Very Rev.

Under no circumstances call priests of the Roman Catholic church

ministers
. Call them either priests or pastors.

The denominational usage in the Methodist church is to call clergymen

preachers
. In the Congregational and Presbyterian churches it is in
accord with denominational usage to call clergymen
ministers
.

Archbishops of the Catholic church carry the prefix
Most Rev.
;
cardinals,
His Eminence
; as,
His Eminence, James, Cardinal Gibbons
.

Invariably the word
Rabbi
should be placed before the name of a Jewish
pastor. It should be written,
Rabbi Leo M. Franklin, of the Temple Beth
El
; never
Dr. Leo M. Franklin, rabbi of the Temple Beth El
.

Never use indiscriminately the prefix
Dr.
in the case of a clergyman.
Clergymen of any denomination are not entitled to the prefix
Dr.

unless the degree of Doctor of Divinity has been conferred on them by
some recognized college or university.

Write a priest's name,
the Rev. Fr. Blank
, or
Fr. Blank
.

COMPOUNDS

Webster's New International Dictionary is the standard of the office on
compounding words, on hyphenation and on spelling, except as the style
of The News noted in this book is different.

VITAL STATISTICS

In writing obituaries the reporter must use the greatest care, for it is
very easy to offend the family of the subject of the obituary. Avoid the
conventional euphemisms.

Prefer:

body
to
remains

send body
to
ship body

coffin
to
casket

flowers
to
floral offerings

funeral
to
obsequies

widow
to
wife

burial
to
interment

the dead man
to
deceased
or
defunct

Avoid:

the late

late residence

solemn black

sable hearse

last sad rites

Marriage
is a state. The ceremony is a
wedding
. Don't marry the man

to
the woman. The woman is always married to the man.

Don't say a marriage was
consummated
.

Funeral
means
interment
. Write:
Funeral services were held at the
church and burial was in Evergreen Cemetery.

Do not use
heart failure
for
heart disease
. All persons die because
the heart fails to beat.

Write simply,
he died
, and not
passed away
,
shuffled off this
mortal coil
,
gave up the ghost
, or any similarly amateurish phrase.
There is no occasion for clothing the incident of death in a panoply of
words, nor should birth be written of except simply. Do not say,
a
little stranger was ushered into a cold world
, but
a child was born
.
In writing of vital statistics—death, birth, marriage—be content to
state the facts without unnecessary embellishment. Forget about the
stork, the grim reaper, Hymen and Cupid.

A DICTIONARY

Wrote Sir Clifford Allbutt: "A dictionary 'sanctions' nothing of its
contents, but it enables us by consultation of its stores to compare and
choose for ourselves. In using this liberty we shall neither be
subservient to the prescriptions of age, nor scornful of modern freedom;
in every use we shall be guided by historical growth, the example of the
best authors, and our present necessities."

NOTES

[54]

DO AND DON'T

Don't use the words
suicide
and
murder
in heads on stories
recounting the details of specific crimes or their prosecution. However,
should a story of the sociological type appear, dealing with, for
example, the increase in the number of suicides or the attempts of the
police to reduce the number of murders, the use of either word in the
headline is allowed. In the body of the story the most natural
expression and good taste must guide the writer, and the use of these
words is permissible if they most clearly and effectively express the
information in hand.

Names of girls or women who are the victims of actual or attempted
indecent attack are not to be published under ordinary circumstances.
Authority for exceptions will be granted by the editor when there is
sufficient reason.

Use the names of POISONS only when essential to the story.

Never call
a policeman a cop
.

Keep the reporter or a representative of The News out of the story. It
is understood that a reporter and a reporter for The News writes a story
that appears in The News.

Write the English language. For
sine qua non
, write
essentials
; for

de
riguer
,
coup d'etat
,
coup de grace
,
Sturm und
Drang
,
au fait
and similar phrases use English equivalents. Some
exceptions are
decollete
,
fiancee
and
fiance
, and other words
which have been taken over into the language. Don't mix languages. Write

a day
, not
per day
. As a general rule use
per
only in the phrase

per cent
.

Comatose
means in a state of
profound insensibility
, not merely
dazed as some writers believe.

Et al.
stands for the Latin
et alii
,
et aliae
, or
et alia
,
meaning
and others
. Of course it should never be written
et als.
to
form a fancied plural.

Prone
means lying flat and face downward. One can not lie prone on the
back.
Supine
means lying on the back.

Use
pseudonym
, a good English word, or
pen name
, and not
nom de
plume
, which isn't even good French. Says L'Intermediaire, a French
journal: "We do not know in our language the expression
nom de plume
.
We have the phrase
nom de guerre
."

Don't use
most
for
almost
, as,
I am most as tall as you
.

Never write
kiddies
or
tots
. Write
kids
when referring to young
goats or to children in stories written in a spirit of levity, as,
This
is the big day for the kids on Belle Isle
. Don't try to arouse sympathy
for children in unfortunate circumstances by calling them
poor little
tots
, or
poor kiddies
.

[55]
Avoid words borrowed from the yellow-backs, such as,
The bullet crashed
through his brain
,
She tripped down the steps
. Try such sentences as
this on your hisser:
"I will not go," he hissed.

In news stories don't use thieves' slang, as,
dick
,
frisk
,
dip
,

gat
.

Don't use the editorial
we
. It is old-fashioned. Say
The Detroit
News
.

Don't refer to the Darwinian theory or to Dr. Osler's theory without
knowing what they mean.

Don't call
a revolver
a gun
or
a pistol a
revolver
. It is
automatic pistol
.

Reporters frequently quote Kipling to the effect that west is west, east
is east, and never the twain shall meet. But if they knew the poem, they
would be aware of the fact that the next line qualifies the quoted lines
and vitiates the observation.

The exception proves the rule
is a phrase that arises from ignorance,
though common to good writers. The original word was
preuves
, which
did not mean
proves
but
tests
.

Say in bad
condition
, not in bad
shape
.

A toga was a garment worn by a Roman citizen. The word is persistently
misused to refer to senatorial honors.

Avoid newspaper slang. To all but a few of our readers the word
story

means not
an item of news
in the paper but a
piece of fiction
. To
speak of a
story
meaning a piece for the paper is to confuse them. Say

article
or
item
.

Don't write
alright
. There is no such word in the language.

Avoid poetic forms. Do not use
amongst
for
among
.
Thither
and

whither
have a bookish sound. Prefer the simple
while
to the fancy

whilst
.

There are no degrees of
certainty
. Don't write a thing seems
more
certain
.

Amateur
means
non-professional
, not necessarily
unskilled
.

Novice
implies lack of skill.

Spectators
see; an
audience
is a collection of
auditors
.

Spectators
go to ball games and motion picture theaters.

Use
render
in speaking of lard and not of songs.

Don't use
complected
for
complexioned
.

Don't write
better half
for
wife
.

Do not write that a thing
grows smaller
.

We write
wages are
. The biblical phrase is,
The wages of sin is
death
.

Don't write
the three first
. You mean
the first three
.

A
justice
presides in police court, in justice court and in the
supreme court. A
judge
presides in other courts except the recorder's
court, which is presided over by the
recorder
and his associate.
Justices of the supreme court of the
[56]
states and the nation are referred
to as
Mr. Justice Jones
or
Chief Justice White
.

Avoid the hackneyed phrase,
a miraculous escape
.

It is almost an unbreakable rule that reporters and copy readers shall
verify all quotations. Many of the most familiar phrases are popularly
misquoted.

Don't write
the above statement
or
the statement given above
. It may
not be
above
when it gets into the paper. Write
the foregoing
statement
.

Don't use
about
meaning
approximately
except with round numbers. Do
not write
about 27 cents
or
about 12 minutes after 8 o'clock
, but
write
about $10
or
about 10,000 persons
.

Don't confuse
O
and
Oh
. The former is the formal spelling of the
interjection and is used usually in poetry, as,
Sail on, O Ship of
State!
It is used in supplication, as,
O God, hear our prayer!
The

Oh
spelling is that commonly used, as,
Oh, dear
;
Oh, what shall I
do?
It is usually written with a comma.

DANA'S EIGHT RULES

Charles A. Dana's eight rules for the guidance of a newspaper man are:

1. Get the news, all the news, and nothing but the news.

2. Copy nothing from another publication without giving perfect credit.

3. Never print an interview without the knowledge and consent of the
party interviewed.

4. Never print a paid advertisement as news matter. Let every
advertisement appear as an advertisement; no sailing under false colors.

5. Never attack the weak and defenseless, either by argument, by
invective, or by ridicule, unless there is some absolute public
necessity for so doing.

6. Fight for your opinions, but do not believe that they contain the
whole truth or the only truth.

7. Support your party, if you have one; but do not think that all the
good men are in it or all the bad ones outside.

8. Above all, believe that humanity is advancing, that there is progress
in human affairs, and that as sure as God lives the future will be
better than the past or present.

THE CANNERY

Dean Alford says: "Be simple, be unaffected, be honest in your speaking
and writing. Call a spade a spade, not a well known oblong instrument of
manual husbandry. Elegance of language may not be in the power of all of
us, but simplicity and straightforwardness are."

Many pages would be required to list all the so-called bromides that
have been worn threadbare by constant use and abuse in newspapers. Often
these phrases are used to avoid what the writer believes to be annoying
repetition. It is better to use the word
fire
many times in a
paragraph than to use the word
conflagration
once.

So many phrases have become hackneyed in newspapers that the comic
magazines make jokes about them. This is from Puck:

Study of a thesaurus—there is one in the library—will enlarge the
vocabulary and help the writer to rid himself of these trite phrases.
How fresh words may give life to a piece of writing is shown in the
chapter in this book on the use of adjectives.

CLARITY, FORCE, GRACE

"Of the three generally recognized qualities of good style—clarity,
force and grace—it is the last and the last alone in which critics of
newspaper English find their material," reads an editorial in the New
York Evening Post. "Beauty, grace, suggestion of that final touch which
confers on its object the immortality of perfect art, are nearly always
conspicuously absent."

[59]

MICHIGAN INSTITUTIONS

There are no convicts in Michigan except men who have escaped or who
have been discharged from institutions in other states. The Michigan
State Prison at Jackson houses inmates. The same is true of the Michigan
Reformatory at Ionia and the State House of Correction at Marquette.
Industrial schools, homes, hospitals and a state public school have
succeeded reform schools in Michigan. The humanizing movement has led
the state to declare that persons detained in such institutions shall be
designated pupils, patients or inmates. There are no prisoners in
Michigan juvenile institutions.

The practice of printing the prison record of a man arrested in
connection with the commission of a crime but not convicted of that
crime is discouraged on The News. Often, former inmates of prisons,
striving to lead decent lives, are brought in by the police on
suspicion. To print their names may be to injure them needlessly without
imparting valuable information to our readers.

The correct names of state institutions as given in the Michigan
Official Directory and Legislative Manual (the red book) are:

University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Michigan Agricultural College, East Lansing.

State Normal College, Ypsilanti.

Central Michigan Normal School, Mt. Pleasant.

Northern State Normal School, Marquette.

Western State Normal School, Kalamazoo.

Michigan College of Mines, Houghton.

Michigan School for the Deaf, Flint.

Michigan School for the Blind, Lansing.

Michigan Employment Institution for the Blind, Saginaw.

State Public School, Coldwater.

Industrial School for Boys, Lansing.

Industrial Home for Girls, Adrian.

Michigan Soldiers' Home, Grand Rapids.

State Psychopathic Hospital, Ann Arbor.

Kalamazoo State Hospital.

Pontiac State Hospital.

Traverse City State Hospital.

Newberry State Hospital.

ARMY AND NAVY ORGANIZATION

The United States Army consists of officers, non-commissioned officers
and privates. Officers hold commissions. Non-commissioned officers hold
warrants. Officers in the regular army engage to serve the United States
for life and may leave the service only on the acceptance of their
resignations, on retirement or on dismissal imposed by sentence of a
general court martial. Enlisted men in time of peace engage to serve for
a definite term of years and at the expiration of this term, return to
civil life or re-enlist as they may elect. Non-commissioned officers are
enlisted men and the duration of their service is governed by the same
rules that apply to privates.

The grades of commissioned officers, given in accordance with their
relative rank are: General, lieutenant-general, major-general,
brigadier-general, colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, first
lieutenant, second lieutenant. The grades of enlisted men are sergeant,
corporal and private. There are numerous special grades in each of these
general classes. Master sergeants, master electricians, etc., are the
highest paid enlisted men and rank all others. Every commissioned
officer ranks every enlisted man regardless of the length of their
respective services. All officers are of equal social rank. Officers and
enlisted men are forbidden to associate socially.

Cadets at the United States Military Academy are neither enlisted nor
commissioned but have a status of their own. Socially they rank with
officers. They are required to salute all officers but are not entitled
to the salutes of enlisted men. Flying cadets in the Signal Corps, who
are candidates for commissions as aviators or aeronauts, also have a
status of their own. They are required to salute officers but do not
receive the salutes of enlisted men. Officers salute one another, the
juniors saluting the seniors, who acknowledge the courtesy.

The infantry organization is based on the company. Under war conditions,
the company consists of 250 men. Four companies form a battalion, and
three battalions a regiment. A headquarters company, a supply company
and a machine gun company also are attached to each regiment. These
three are smaller than the other companies. The band is part of the
headquarters company.

The cavalry organization includes the troop, squadron of four troops,
and regiment of three squadrons, with headquarters, machine gun and
supply organizations. The field artillery regiment is made up of six
batteries, divided into two battalions. It also has headquarters and
supply companies.

The infantry company is divided into platoons and the platoons into
squads of eight men each. The field artillery battery is divided into
platoons and sections. The coast artillery until the war had no
regimental organization but consisted of several separate companies. All
the companies stationed in a
[61]
coast defense district were under the
command of the ranking officer in that district. For service abroad with
heavy mobile artillery, several coast artillery regiments were organized
on the infantry model.

The United States Navy consists of commissioned officers, warrant
officers, petty officers and enlisted men without ratings. The officers'
grades are: Admiral of the Navy, vice-admiral, rear-admiral, captain,
commander, lieutenant-commander, lieutenant, lieutenant junior grade,
ensign. The warrant officers rank below commissioned officers and above
enlisted men. Gunners, boatswains, machinists, etc., are warrant
officers. They wear a uniform similar to that of commissioned officers
but with different insignia. Chief petty officers and petty officers are
enlisted men. Chief petty officers wear a double-breasted blouse and a
cap similar to that won by officers but with a different ornament. Petty
officers and unrated enlisted men wear the sailor shirt and either the
flat hat or the watch cap. Petty officers are rated first, second and
third class, the first the highest. Men aboard ship are organized in
divisions. The commander of a ship is called captain by courtesy
regardless of his real grade.

The marine corps is under the control of the Navy Department but has an
organization separate from the Navy proper. It has the same grades of
officers and non-commissioned officers (with some exceptions among the
latter) as the army. The corps is commanded by a major-general, which is
the highest grade to which marine corps officers are eligible.

THE WAY TO BECOME ORIGINAL

Here is a classic bit of advice given by Flaubert to de Maupassant:

"Whatever one wishes to say, there is only one noun to express it, only
one verb to give it life, only one adjective to

qualify
it.
Search, then, till that noun, that verb, that adjective are discovered;
never be content with 'very nearly,' never have recourse to tricks,
however happy; or to buffooneries of language; to avoid a difficulty.
This is the way to become original."

COMMUNITY SPIRIT . . .  ART LETTERS AND
SCIENCE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE.

NOTES

[64]

THE LAW OF LIBEL

The following general statement of some of the fundamental principles
governing the law of libel is intended to enable the newspaper writer to
guard against the publication of indefensible libelous matter.

The intention is to state the rules and principles, as far as possible,
without legal technicalities, and to include only such portions of the
law on the subject as may be necessary or essential for the
accomplishment of the double object desired.

For the purposes of the newspaper writer, libel may be defined as
malicious defamation, either written or printed, charging on or imputing
to another that which renders him liable to imprisonment, or tends to
injure his reputation in the common estimation of mankind, or to hold
him up as an object of hatred, scorn, ridicule or contempt.

Slander is malicious defamation by speech or oral language; hence the
newspaper writer has no especial concern for the law relating to it,
further than to remember one general principle—that the law of libel is
much stricter than the law of slander. Thus, one may apply to another

orally
words of personal vituperation and abuse that would not render
him liable in a suit for slander, but which if published of another in a
newspaper would be libelous and actionable.

The definition of libel here given is broad enough to cover all the
experiences of the newspaper office. But the character of defamatory
publication that is brought within its scope is best shown by the
language of the courts in individual instances.

ACTIONABLE LANGUAGE

Language in writing has been held to be actionable
per se
which
"denies to a man the possession of some such worthy quality as every man
is
a priori
to be taken to possess"; "which
tends
to bring a party
into public hatred or disgrace"; which "tends to degrade him in
society"; which "tends to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule";
which "reflects on his character"; which "imputes something disgraceful
to him"; which "throws contumely and odium on him"; which "tends to
vilify him"; which "tends to injure his character or diminish his
reputation"; which is "injurious to his social character"; which "shows
him to be immoral or ridiculous"; which "induces an ill opinion of him";
which "detracts from his character as a man of good morals"; which
"imputes to him a bad reputation" or "degradation of character" or
"ingratitude," and "
all defamatory words injurious in their nature
."

Each of the following terms charged on one personally in writing or in
print has been adjudged in one or more reported cases to be libelous and
actionable, namely:

[65]
That he was a "villain"; "liar"; "rogue"; "rascal"; "swindler";
"drunkard"; "informer"; that he was the author or the publisher of a
libel or slander; that he was a "libelous journalist"; "a hypocrite, and
using the cloak of religion for unworthy purposes"; "an imp of the
devil"; "a miserable fellow it is impossible for a newspaper article to
injure to the extent of six cents"; and "that the community can hardly
despise him worse than they do now"; that he had paid money to procure
an appointment to an office; that he had received money for offices;
that he had been "deprived of the ordinances of the church"; that he was
"thought no more of than a horsethief and a counterfeiter"; that he had
infringed a patent; that he had been guilty of falsehood; of
"dishonesty"; or "moral obliquity"; of "smuggling"; of "blasphemy"; of
"false swearing"; that he was "insane"; that he was "fit for a lunatic
asylum and unsafe to go at large"; that he had been guilty of gross
misconduct in insulting females, etc. Where quotation marks are used,
they indicate the exact language used in the respective publications
complained of on which the suit was brought.

OBJECTIONABLE PUBLISHED CHARGES

The following published charges have been held to be objectionable,
namely:

Want of chastity (as applied to women, at all events) or adultery
(charged on either man or woman); the publication of the obituary of a
person known to the writer to be living; a charge that a member of
Congress was a "misrepresentative" and a groveling office-seeker; that a
juror agreed with another juror to rest the determination of the damages
in a case upon a game of checkers; characterizing a verdict of a jury as
"infamous" and charging the jurors with having done injustice to their
oaths; stating in the criticism of a book that the motives of the author
are dishonorable or disreputable.

The illustrations of this character might be multiplied indefinitely,
but these cover the general range of libelous expressions when
personally applied to an individual.

Imputations on character in allegory or irony may amount to a libel.

Imputing to a person the qualities of a frozen snake in the fable;

heading
an article in regard to a lawyer's sharp practices, "An Honest
Lawyer."

The general rule is that it is libelous
per se
to impute to a person
in his official capacity, profession, trade or business any kind of
fraud, dishonesty, misconduct, incapacity or unfitness—any imputation,
in fact, which would
tend
to prevent him deriving that pecuniary
reward from a
legitimate
business which otherwise he would have
obtained.

It has been held actionable to publish of a
butcher
that he used false
weights; of a
jeweler
that he was a "cozening knave" who sold a
sapphire for a diamond; of a
brewer
that he makes and sells
unwholesome beer or uses filthy water in the malting of grain for
brewing; of a
tradesman
that he adulterates the article he sells; of a

schoolmaster
that he is an "ignoramus" on the subject he pretends
[66]
to
teach; of a
clergyman
that he is immoral, or "preaches lies" or is a
"drunkard" or "perjurer"; of an
attorney
that he offered himself as a
witness in order to divulge the secrets of his client, or that he
"betrayed his client," or "would take a fee from both sides," or that he
"deserves to be struck off the roll"; of a
physician
that he is an
"empiric," or "mountebank," or "quack," or "vends quack medicines"; of a

mechanic
that he is ignorant of his trade; of a
judge
that he lacks
capacity and has abandoned the common principles of truth; and of anyone

in public office
of a charge of malfeasance or want of capacity to
fulfill its duties.

So also personal criticism of an
author
might go so far as to injure
him in his business as an author and come within the rule. And so of any
other occupation from which the injured person derives pecuniary
benefit.

CHARGING WITH A CRIME

It is hardly necessary, except for completeness, to add that to charge a
person with
any crime
brings the publication within the definition of
libel.

If matter libelous
per se
is published falsely concerning a person he
is
presumed
to have suffered loss without proving the specific amount
or the manner of loss, the amount of damages being found by the jury in
accordance with the circumstances of the case and various legal rules.

If the language complained of does not come within the foregoing
definitions and limitations, and is not therefore libelous
per se
,
still, if untrue, it may furnish the basis for a libel suit
where it
has resulted in pecuniary loss or the loss of other material advantage
.

"Any false words are actionable," say the courts, "by which the party
has sustained
special damage
."

But special damages have to be proved. That is to say, in such case,
excluding general damages arising from a
per se
libel, the character
and manner of the loss and the amount in dollars and cents must be
proved, and the verdict should not exceed such amount.

A single illustration will be sufficient for this class.

A newspaper
falsely
publishes that a man has died of the smallpox at a
certain hotel. The proprietor brings a libel suit, claiming loss of
custom by way of special damage. His recovery would be limited to such
special damages as he could fairly show.

Libel has been defined above as "
malicious
defamation," etc. But it is
not generally necessary that the injured complainant should prove actual
malice. If the defamatory matter complained of is
false
, the law

presumes
that the publication was malicious, unless it can be shown
either that it was "privileged" by statute or otherwise, or the
presumption of malice is overcome by actual proof. That is to say, if
the publisher claims that, although false and not privileged, the
defamatory publication was not malicious, he must prove it.

Of course, if it was not false, it would not be legally malicious.
[67]

THE THREE DEFENSES

The defense to libel suits, therefore, are three, namely:

(1) To prove the published charge is true. This is called a
"justification."

(2) To show that the publication was "privileged."

(3) To prove circumstances connected with the publication tending to
show that it was not malicious, or was provoked and excused by the
conduct of the complainant. This is called a defense "in mitigation of
damages."

To prove that the defamatory publication complained of is
true
is an
absolute and complete defense.

The old maxim of the English criminal law, "The greater the truth the
greater the libel," frequently quoted erroneously in this connection,
has no application to actions in the civil courts, and at the present
time would scarcely be invoked even in any of the criminal courts of
this country, except under the most extraordinary circumstances.

But it is not enough that the writer of defamatory articles himself
knows that they are true, unless he is able to produce, when required,

competent legal proof of their truth
. What he himself has witnessed
is, of course, competent evidence as far as it goes; when such proof can
be strengthened by official records or other documentary proof, and by
the evidence of other persons who can testify of their personal
knowledge to the truth of the publications, a defense of the strongest
character is presented.

But one distinction should be observed carefully, a misconception in
regard to which has given rise to many libel suits that have been
difficult to defend. When it is said that "the truth is a complete
defense," the literal truth of the published statement is not meant;

but the truth of the defamatory charge
.

To illustrate
: A prominent official, say a judge, during the progress
of a political campaign, either in the course of an interview or of a
public speech, makes the charge against a candidate for an important
office that he (the candidate) obtained his naturalization papers either
through perjury or subornation of perjury. A newspaper publishes the
interview or the speech, giving the speaker's name and the exact
language he used. If the candidate referred to should sue the newspaper
for libel because of this publication, it would be no defense for the
publishers to show that it was
true
that the speaker had said just
exactly what the newspaper represented him to have said. To justify they
would have to show that the defamatory charge was true, that the
candidate had been guilty of perjury or subornation of perjury in
obtaining his naturalization papers.

In other words, no publishers or writers can escape responsibility for
defaming a man's character by showing that it was on the authority of
some other individual.

The same principle applies to defamatory accusations republished from
another
[68]
newspaper, whether the name of the newspaper from which they
are copied is given or not.

PRIVILEGED PUBLICATIONS

There is a certain class of publications concerning official proceedings
which, although they be defamatory in character, public policy demands
that publishers should be protected in making, entirely regardless of
the question whether the defamatory matter be true or false. These are
termed "privileged publications" and are defined by law.

The mere fact that a paper is
entitled
as being in a certain suit or
that
its contents are sworn to
does not necessarily make it a part of
any "judicial, legislative or other public and official proceedings."
Such proceedings must actually and legally have been instituted before
it becomes entitled to the privilege.

An instance
would be the publication of libelous statements taken from
a complaint or affidavit that had been sworn to in a suit but before

the paper had been actually introduced in the trial of the case
. Here
there would be no privilege.

The same would be true of an affidavit charging crime on a person which
had not before the publication of it been presented to and judicially
recognized by the committing or police magistrate.

Criticism is also privileged in a limited degree. Nowhere else in the
world, not even in England, is so great freedom of legitimate criticism
allowed and protected by law as in the United States.

The Constitution of the United States provides: "Congress shall make no
law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press."

The Constitution of Michigan provides: "Every citizen may freely speak,
write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for
the abuse of that right; and no law shall be passed to restrain or
abridge the liberty of speech or of the press. In all prosecutions for
libel the truth may be given in evidence to the jury; and if it shall
appear to the jury that the matter charged as libelous is true and was
published with good motives and for justifiable ends, accused shall be
acquitted."

But the right to criticise is general, and belongs quite as much to any
other individual as to the newspaper writer, editor or publisher.

The
actions
of individuals are always legitimate subjects of
discussion and criticism.

"In this country," says Judge Smith, of the New Hampshire Supreme Court,
"every citizen has the right to call the attention of his
fellow-citizens to the maladministration of public affairs or the
misconduct of public servants, if his real motive in so doing is to
bring about a reform of abuses or to defeat the re-election or
reappointment of an incompetent officer."

[69]
"No one can doubt the importance," is the language of Judge Story, "in a
free government of the right to canvass the
acts
of public men and the
tendency of public measures—to censure boldly the conduct of rulers and
to scrutinize the policy and plans of government."

The language of the English courts is nearly as broad.

"God forbid that you should not be allowed to comment on the
conduct

of all mankind, providing you do it justly and honorably," says Baron
Alderson.

Chief Justice Cockburn said: "It is of vast importance that criticism,
so long as it is fair, reasonable and just, should be allowed the utmost
latitude, and that the most unsparing censure of works which are fairly
subject to it should not be held libelous."

CRITICISM DOES NOT EXTEND TO PERSON

But the privilege of criticism extends only to the
actions
or
works

of an individual; it does not extend to the
person
. In the case of an
author, his
works
may be criticised as severely as the occasion
demands. "Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgment
of the public," says an eminent English judge; but this can not be made
the excuse for personal abuse of the author himself.

The author, the artist, the architect, who produces a book, a painting
or a building, is in this respect in the same position as the maker or
producer of a watch, a piano or a carving-knife.

The thing produced in either case may be "criticised." But if the

person
who produces it is defamed, this must be defended, if at all,
upon some other ground than that it is
criticism
.

Moreover, to justify such comment on men's actions or on the products of
their hands or brains
as criticism
, it is essential that the acts or
things so criticised should have actual existence.

For instance
, a newspaper comments with great severity on certain
occurrences which it publishes as the official acts of a mayor of its
city. Before these strictures can be defended as
criticism
, it must
appear that such official acts really occurred.

Again, newspaper proprietors might well be held liable for publishing a
ridiculing criticism of language pretended to be quoted from the book
which the critic is reviewing, but which language the author of the book
had not actually used.

If the publishers who are defendants in a libel suit are unable to show
that the defamatory publication is
true
or that it is
privileged
,
then the injured plaintiff is entitled to a verdict
in some amount
.
How small this sum shall be will depend upon how good a case the
defendants can make out
in mitigation of damages
. The range of
defenses that may be interposed for this purpose is very broad. The
following may be enumerated as the most important:

[70]
(1) That the general conduct of the plaintiff gave the defendant
"probable cause" for believing the charges to be true.

(2) That the complainant's general character is bad.

(3) That the publication was made in heat and passion, provoked by the
acts of the plaintiff.

(4) That the charge published had been made orally in the presence of
the plaintiff before publication, and he had not denied it.

(5) That the publication was made of a political antagonist in the heat
of a political campaign.

(6) That as soon as the defendant discovered that he was in error he
published a retraction, correction or apology.

(7) That the defamatory publication had reference not to the plaintiff,
but to another person of a similar name, concerning whom the charges
were true, and that readers understood this other individual to be
meant.

ABSENCE OF ACTUAL MALICE

The principle underlying all the above defenses is that they tend to
show an absence of
actual malice
. Many other circumstances, too
numerous and varied to be classified, and which properly could be used
in the same manner and for the same reason to reduce damages, will
readily suggest themselves to every one.

The successful defense of libel suits depends largely on having clear
and trustworthy proof of the facts sought to be sustained promptly at
hand as soon as the suit is brought.

Any metropolitan newspaper that deserves the name finds itself compelled
every day to publish matter that is defamatory in character. Otherwise
there would be no journalistic records of crimes or of a large portion
of the other occurrences in which the public is interested. The
publisher's concern in that particular is a double one—that whatever of
that nature is published in his newspaper should be
true
or

privileged
and that there should be clear
proof
of the truth or
privilege.

Every newspaper writer frequently finds himself called upon to deal with
such matter. If it is the report of a trial in court, he need have
regard, so far as his report is concerned, to four points: (1) that the
judicial or official proceedings have been already begun in open court;
(2) that his report of the testimony, etc., or synopsis of the sworn
papers is fair and impartial; (3) that he knows where he can put his
hands on the official records to sustain the privilege at any time; and
(4) that both sides are similarly published.

If the matter is defamatory and not privileged in any way, then the
utmost care before publication with regard to the proof of its truth
will be the only safeguard against libel suits.

The publication of such matter on the authority of any person's mere
word,
[71]
however truthful, trustworthy and careful that person may be
believed to be, will always be attended with danger. The statements may
be entirely true, and yet the giver of the information when called upon
may not be able to furnish the proof. If he is, probably he could
furnish it as well before as after publication.

The only absolutely certain way for any newspaper writer to avoid all
risk of this sort is for him to furnish for publication such defamatory
matter only as he can sustain by his own testimony as an eye-witness, or
such as he has seen the proofs of before writing the article.

The almost certain result will be to prevent the bringing of a libel
suit—the first consideration in this connection. If, on the other hand,
a libel suit should be brought, the writer would be able to furnish the
publishers with the best means of defense, namely, proof of the truth of
the publication—which is of next importance.

PRECISION, SIMPLICITY, EUPHONY

Adams Sherman Hill, professor of rhetoric at Harvard University for
nearly 30 years, gives these three rules for good writing:

Precision: Of two forms of expression which may be used in the same
sense, that one should be chosen which is susceptible of only one
interpretation. Observance of this rule tends to give each word a
meaning of its own.

Simplicity: Of two forms of expression which may be used in the same
sense, the simpler should be chosen. The simpler a word or phrase, the
more likely it is to be understood, and simplicity in language, like
simplicity in dress or manners, belongs to the best society.

Euphony: Of two forms of expression which may be used in the same sense,
that one should be chosen which is the more agreeable to the ear. It is
of course wrong to give undue weight to considerations of euphony, but
when no sacrifice is involved it is desirable to avoid an expression
that is unusually difficult to pronounce or to substitute for an
extremely disagreeable word one that is agreeable to the ear.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

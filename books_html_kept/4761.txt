Chapter I

All is quiet in Moscow. The squeak of wheels is seldom heard in the
snow-covered street. There are no lights left in the windows and the street
lamps have been extinguished. Only the sound of bells, borne over the city from
the church towers, suggests the approach of morning. The streets are deserted.
At rare intervals a night-cabmanâs sledge kneads up the snow and sand in the
street as the driver makes his way to another corner where he falls asleep
while waiting for a fare. An old woman passes by on her way to church, where a
few wax candles burn with a red light reflected on the gilt mountings of the
icons. Workmen are already getting up after the long winter night and going to
their workâbut for the gentlefolk it is still evening.

From a window in Chevalierâs Restaurant a lightâillegal at that hourâis still
to be seen through a chink in the shutter. At the entrance a carriage, a
sledge, and a cabmanâs sledge, stand close together with their backs to the
curbstone. A three-horse sledge from the post-station is there also. A
yard-porter muffled up and pinched with cold is sheltering behind the corner of
the house.

âAnd whatâs the good of all this jawing?â thinks the footman who sits in the
hall weary and haggard. âThis always happens when Iâm on duty.â From the
adjoining room are heard the voices of three young men, sitting there at a
table on which are wine and the remains of supper. One, a rather plain, thin,
neat little man, sits looking with tired kindly eyes at his friend, who is
about to start on a journey. Another, a tall man, lies on a sofa beside a table
on which are empty bottles, and plays with his watch-key. A third, wearing a
short, fur-lined coat, is pacing up and down the room stopping now and then to
crack an almond between his strong, rather thick, but well-tended fingers. He
keeps smiling at something and his face and eyes are all aglow. He speaks
warmly and gesticulates, but evidently does not find the words he wants and
those that occur to him seem to him inadequate to express what has risen to his
heart.

âNow I can speak out fully,â said the traveller. âI donât want to defend
myself, but I should like you at least to understand me as I understand myself,
and not look at the matter superficially. You say I have treated her badly,â he
continued, addressing the man with the kindly eyes who was watching him.

âYes, you are to blame,â said the latter, and his look seemed to express still
more kindliness and weariness.

âI know why you say that,â rejoined the one who was leaving. âTo be loved is in
your opinion as great a happiness as to love, and if a man obtains it, it is
enough for his whole life.â

âYes, quite enough, my dear fellow, more than enough!â confirmed the plain
little man, opening and shutting his eyes.

âBut why shouldnât the man love too?â said the traveller thoughtfully, looking
at his friend with something like pity. âWhy shouldnât one love? Because love
doesnât come ... No, to be beloved is a misfortune. It is a misfortune to feel
guilty because you do not give something you cannot give. O my God!â he added,
with a gesture of his arm. âIf it all happened reasonably, and not all
topsy-turvyânot in our way but in a way of its own! Why, itâs as if I had
stolen that love! You think so too, donât deny it. You must think so. But will
you believe it, of all the horrid and stupid things I have found time to do in
my lifeâand there are manyâthis is one I do not and cannot repent of. Neither
at the beginning nor afterwards did I lie to myself or to her. It seemed to me
that I had at last fallen in love, but then I saw that it was an involuntary
falsehood, and that that was not the way to love, and I could not go on, but
she did. Am I to blame that I couldnât? What was I to do?â

âWell, itâs ended now!â said his friend, lighting a cigar to master his
sleepiness. âThe fact is that you have not yet loved and do not know what love
is.â

The man in the fur-lined coat was going to speak again, and put his hands to
his head, but could not express what he wanted to say.

âNever loved! ... Yes, quite true, I never have! But after all, I have within
me a desire to love, and nothing could be stronger than that desire! But then,
again, does such love exist? There always remains something incomplete. Ah
well! Whatâs the use of talking? Iâve made an awful mess of life! But anyhow
itâs all over now; you are quite right. And I feel that I am beginning a new
life.â

âWhich you will again make a mess of,â said the man who lay on the sofa playing
with his watch-key. But the traveller did not listen to him.

âI am sad and yet glad to go,â he continued. âWhy I am sad I donât know.â

And the traveller went on talking about himself, without noticing that this did
not interest the others as much as it did him. A man is never such an egotist
as at moments of spiritual ecstasy. At such times it seems to him that there is
nothing on earth more splendid and interesting than himself.

âDmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich! The coachman wonât wait any longer!â said a young serf,
entering the room in a sheepskin coat, with a scarf tied round his head. âThe
horses have been standing since twelve, and itâs now four oâclock!â

DmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich looked at his serf, VanyÃºsha. The scarf round VanyÃºshaâs head,
his felt boots and sleepy face, seemed to be calling his master to a new life
of labour, hardship, and activity.

âTrue enough! Good-bye!â said he, feeling for the unfastened hook and eye on
his coat.

In spite of advice to mollify the coachman by another tip, he put on his cap
and stood in the middle of the room. The friends kissed once, then again, and
after a pause, a third time. The man in the fur-lined coat approached the table
and emptied a champagne glass, then took the plain little manâs hand and
blushed.

âAh well, I will speak out all the same ... I must and will be frank with you
because I am fond of you ... Of course you love herâI always thought soâdonât
you?â

âYes,â answered his friend, smiling still more gently.

âAnd perhaps...â

âPlease sir, I have orders to put out the candles,â said the sleepy attendant,
who had been listening to the last part of the conversation and wondering why
gentlefolk always talk about one and the same thing. âTo whom shall I make out
the bill? To you, sir?â he added, knowing whom to address and turning to the
tall man.

âTo me,â replied the tall man. âHow much?â

âTwenty-six rubles.â

The tall man considered for a moment, but said nothing and put the bill in his
pocket.

The other two continued their talk.

âGood-bye, you are a capital fellow!â said the short plain man with the mild
eyes. Tears filled the eyes of both. They stepped into the porch.

âOh, by the by,â said the traveller, turning with a blush to the tall man,
âwill you settle Chevalierâs bill and write and let me know?â

âAll right, all right!â said the tall man, pulling on his gloves. âHow I envy
you!â he added quite unexpectedly when they were out in the porch.

The traveller got into his sledge, wrapped his coat about him, and said: âWell
then, come along!â He even moved a little to make room in the sledge for the
man who said he envied himâhis voice trembled.

âGood-bye, MÃ­tya! I hope that with Godâs help you...â said the tall one. But
his wish was that the other would go away quickly, and so he could not finish
the sentence.

They were silent a moment. Then someone again said, âGood-bye,â and a voice
cried, âReady,â and the coachman touched up the horses.

âHy, ElisÃ¡r!â One of the friends called out, and the other coachman and the
sledge-drivers began moving, clicking their tongues and pulling at the reins.
Then the stiffened carriage-wheels rolled squeaking over the frozen snow.

âA fine fellow, that OlÃ©nin!â said one of the friends. âBut what an idea to go
to the Caucasusâas a cadet, too! I wouldnât do it for anything. ... Are you
dining at the club tomorrow?â

âYes.â

They separated.

The traveller felt warm, his fur coat seemed too hot. He sat on the bottom of
the sledge and unfastened his coat, and the three shaggy post-horses dragged
themselves out of one dark street into another, past houses he had never before
seen. It seemed to OlÃ©nin that only travellers starting on a long journey went
through those streets. All was dark and silent and dull around him, but his
soul was full of memories, love, regrets, and a pleasant tearful feeling.

Chapter II

âIâm fond of them, very fond! ... First-rate fellows! ... Fine!â he kept
repeating, and felt ready to cry. But why he wanted to cry, who were the
first-rate fellows he was so fond ofâwas more than he quite knew. Now and then
he looked round at some house and wondered why it was so curiously built;
sometimes he began wondering why the post-boy and VanyÃºsha, who were so
different from himself, sat so near, and together with him were being jerked
about and swayed by the tugs the side-horses gave at the frozen traces, and
again he repeated: âFirst rate ... very fond!â and once he even said: âAnd how
it seizes one ... excellent!â and wondered what made him say it. âDear me, am I
drunk?â he asked himself. He had had a couple of bottles of wine, but it was
not the wine alone that was having this effect on OlÃ©nin. He remembered all the
words of friendship heartily, bashfully, spontaneously (as he believed)
addressed to him on his departure. He remembered the clasp of hands, glances,
the moments of silence, and the sound of a voice saying, âGood-bye, MÃ­tya!â
when he was already in the sledge. He remembered his own deliberate frankness.
And all this had a touching significance for him. Not only friends and
relatives, not only people who had been indifferent to him, but even those who
did not like him, seemed to have agreed to become fonder of him, or to forgive
him, before his departure, as people do before confession or death. âPerhaps I
shall not return from the Caucasus,â he thought. And he felt that he loved his
friends and some one besides. He was sorry for himself. But it was not love for
his friends that so stirred and uplifted his heart that he could not repress
the meaningless words that seemed to rise of themselves to his lips; nor was it
love for a woman (he had never yet been in love) that had brought on this mood.
Love for himself, love full of hopeâwarm young love for all that was good in
his own soul (and at that moment it seemed to him that there was nothing but
good in it)âcompelled him to weep and to mutter incoherent words.

OlÃ©nin was a youth who had never completed his university course, never served
anywhere (having only a nominal post in some government office or other), who
had squandered half his fortune and had reached the age of twenty-four without
having done anything or even chosen a career. He was what in Moscow society is
termed
un jeune homme
.

At the age of eighteen he was freeâas only rich young Russians in the âforties
who had lost their parents at an early age could be. Neither physical nor moral
fetters of any kind existed for him; he could do as he liked, lacking nothing
and bound by nothing. Neither relatives, nor fatherland, nor religion, nor
wants, existed for him. He believed in nothing and admitted nothing. But
although he believed in nothing he was not a morose or blase young man, nor
self-opinionated, but on the contrary continually let himself be carried away.
He had come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as love, yet his
heart always overflowed in the presence of any young and attractive woman. He
had long been aware that honours and position were nonsense, yet involuntarily
he felt pleased when at a ball Prince Sergius came up and spoke to him affably.
But he yielded to his impulses only in so far as they did not limit his
freedom. As soon as he had yielded to any influence and became conscious of its
leading on to labour and struggle, he instinctively hastened to free himself
from the feeling or activity into which he was being drawn and to regain his
freedom. In this way he experimented with society-life, the civil service,
farming, musicâto which at one time he intended to devote his lifeâand even
with the love of women in which he did not believe. He meditated on the use to
which he should devote that power of youth which is granted to man only once in
a lifetime: that force which gives a man the power of making himself, or
evenâas it seemed to himâof making the universe, into anything he wishes:
should it be to art, to science, to love of woman, or to practical activities?
It is true that some people are devoid of this impulse, and on entering life at
once place their necks under the first yoke that offers itself and honestly
labour under it for the rest of their lives. But OlÃ©nin was too strongly
conscious of the presence of that all-powerful God of Youthâof that capacity to
be entirely transformed into an aspiration or ideaâthe capacity to wish and to
doâto throw oneself headlong into a bottomless abyss without knowing why or
wherefore. He bore this consciousness within himself, was proud of it and,
without knowing it, was happy in that consciousness. Up to that time he had
loved only himself, and could not help loving himself, for he expected nothing
but good of himself and had not yet had time to be disillusioned. On leaving
Moscow he was in that happy state of mind in which a young man, conscious of
past mistakes, suddenly says to himself, âThat was not the real thing.â All
that had gone before was accidental and unimportant. Till then he had not
really tried to live, but now with his departure from Moscow a new life was
beginningâa life in which there would be no mistakes, no remorse, and certainly
nothing but happiness.

It is always the case on a long journey that till the first two or three stages
have been passed imagination continues to dwell on the place left behind, but
with the first morning on the road it leaps to the end of the journey and there
begins building castles in the air. So it happened to OlÃ©nin.

After leaving the town behind, he gazed at the snowy fields and felt glad to be
alone in their midst. Wrapping himself in his fur coat, he lay at the bottom of
the sledge, became tranquil, and fell into a doze. The parting with his friends
had touched him deeply, and memories of that last winter spent in Moscow and
images of the past, mingled with vague thoughts and regrets, rose unbidden in
his imagination.

He remembered the friend who had seen him off and his relations with the girl
they had talked about. The girl was rich. âHow could he love her knowing that
she loved me?â thought he, and evil suspicions crossed his mind. âThere is much
dishonesty in men when one comes to reflect.â Then he was confronted by the
question: âBut really, how is it I have never been in love? Every one tells me
that I never have. Can it be that I am a moral monstrosity?â And he began to
recall all his infatuations. He recalled his entry into society, and a friendâs
sister with whom he spent several evenings at a table with a lamp on it which
lit up her slender fingers busy with needlework, and the lower part of her
pretty delicate face. He recalled their conversations that dragged on like the
game in which one passes on a stick which one keeps alight as long as possible,
and the general awkwardness and restraint and his continual feeling of
rebellion at all that conventionality. Some voice had always whispered: âThatâs
not it, thatâs not it,â and so it had proved. Then he remembered a ball and the
mazurka he danced with the beautiful Dââ. âHow much in love I was that night
and how happy! And how hurt and vexed I was next morning when I woke and felt
myself still free! Why does not love come and bind me hand and foot?â thought
he. âNo, there is no such thing as love! That neighbour who used to tell me, as
she told DubrÃ³vin and the Marshal, that she loved the stars, was not
it

either.â

And now his farming and work in the country recurred to his mind, and in those
recollections also there was nothing to dwell on with pleasure. âWill they talk
long of my departure?â came into his head; but who âtheyâ were he did not quite
know. Next came a thought that made him wince and mutter incoherently. It was
the recollection of M. Cappele the tailor, and the six hundred and
seventy-eight rubles he still owed him, and he recalled the words in which he
had begged him to wait another year, and the look of perplexity and resignation
which had appeared on the tailorâs face. âOh, my God, my God!â he repeated,
wincing and trying to drive away the intolerable thought. âAll the same and in
spite of everything she loved me,â thought he of the girl they had talked about
at the farewell supper. âYes, had I married her I should not now be owing
anything, and as it is I am in debt to VasÃ­lyev.â Then he remembered the last
night he had played with VasÃ­lyev at the club (just after leaving her), and he
recalled his humiliating requests for another game and the otherâs cold
refusal. âA yearâs economizing and they will all be paid, and the devil take
them!â... But despite this assurance he again began calculating his outstanding
debts, their dates, and when he could hope to pay them off. âAnd I owe
something to Morell as well as to Chevalier,â thought he, recalling the night
when he had run up so large a debt. It was at a carousel at the gipsies
arranged by some fellows from Petersburg: SÃ¡shka Bââ, an aide-de-camp to the
Tsar, Prince Dââ, and that pompous oldââ. âHow is it those gentlemen are so
self-satisfied?â thought he, âand by what right do they form a clique to which
they think others must be highly flattered to be admitted? Can it be because
they are on the Emperorâs staff? Why, itâs awful what fools and scoundrels they
consider other people to be! But I showed them that I at any rate, on the
contrary, do not at all want their intimacy. All the same, I fancy Andrew, the
steward, would be amazed to know that I am on familiar terms with a man like
SÃ¡shka Bââ, a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the Tsar! Yes, and no one drank
more than I did that evening, and I taught the gipsies a new song and everyone
listened to it. Though I have done many foolish things, all the same I am a
very good fellow,â thought he.

Morning found him at the third post-stage. He drank tea, and himself helped
VanyÃºsha to move his bundles and trunks and sat down among them, sensible,
erect, and precise, knowing where all his belongings were, how much money he
had and where it was, where he had put his passport and the post-horse
requisition and toll-gate papers, and it all seemed to him so well arranged
that he grew quite cheerful and the long journey before him seemed an extended
pleasure-trip.

All that morning and noon he was deep in calculations of how many versts he had
travelled, how many remained to the next stage, how many to the next town, to
the place where he would dine, to the place where he would drink tea, and to
StavrÃ³pol, and what fraction of the whole journey was already accomplished. He
also calculated how much money he had with him, how much would be left over,
how much would pay off all his debts, and what proportion of his income he
would spend each month. Towards evening, after tea, he calculated that to
StavrÃ³pol there still remained seven-elevenths of the whole journey, that his
debts would require seven monthsâ economy and one-eighth of his whole fortune;
and then, tranquillized, he wrapped himself up, lay down in the sledge, and
again dozed off. His imagination was now turned to the future: to the Caucasus.
All his dreams of the future were mingled with pictures of Amalat-Beks,
Circassian women, mountains, precipices, terrible torrents, and perils. All
these things were vague and dim, but the love of fame and the danger of death
furnished the interest of that future. Now, with unprecedented courage and a
strength that amazed everyone, he slew and subdued an innumerable host of
hillsmen; now he was himself a hillsman and with them was maintaining their
independence against the Russians. As soon as he pictured anything definite,
familiar Moscow figures always appeared on the scene. SÃ¡shka Bââ fights with
the Russians or the hillsmen against him. Even the tailor Cappele in some
strange way takes part in the conquerorâs triumph. Amid all this he remembered
his former humiliations, weaknesses, and mistakes, and the recollection was not
disagreeable. It was clear that there among the mountains, waterfalls, fair
Circassians, and dangers, such mistakes could not recur. Having once made full
confession to himself there was an end of it all. One other vision, the
sweetest of them all, mingled with the young manâs every thought of the
futureâthe vision of a woman. And there, among the mountains, she appeared to
his imagination as a Circassian slave, a fine figure with a long plait of hair
and deep submissive eyes. He pictured a lonely hut in the mountains, and on the
threshold
she
stands awaiting him when, tired and covered with dust,
blood, and fame, he returns to her. He is conscious of her kisses, her
shoulders, her sweet voice, and her submissiveness. She is enchanting, but
uneducated, wild, and rough. In the long winter evenings he begins her
education. She is clever and gifted and quickly acquires all the knowledge
essential. Why not? She can quite easily learn foreign languages, read the
French masterpieces and understand them:
Notre Dame de Paris
, for
instance, is sure to please her. She can also speak French. In a drawing-room
she can show more innate dignity than a lady of the highest society. She can
sing, simply, powerfully, and passionately.... âOh, what nonsense!â said he to
himself. But here they reached a post-station and he had to change into another
sledge and give some tips. But his fancy again began searching for the
ânonsenseâ he had relinquished, and again fair Circassians, glory, and his
return to Russia with an appointment as aide-de-camp and a lovely wife rose
before his imagination. âBut thereâs no such thing as love,â said he to
himself. âFame is all rubbish. But the six hundred and seventy-eight rubles?...
And the conquered land that will bring me more wealth than I need for a
lifetime? It will not be right though to keep all that wealth for myself. I
shall have to distribute it. But to whom? Well, six hundred and seventy-eight
rubles to Cappele and then weâll see.â ... Quite vague visions now cloud his
mind, and only VanyÃºshaâs voice and the interrupted motion of the sledge break
his healthy youthful slumber. Scarcely conscious, he changes into another
sledge at the next stage and continues his journey.

Next morning everything goes on just the same: the same kind of post-stations
and tea-drinking, the same moving horsesâ cruppers, the same short talks with
VanyÃºsha, the same vague dreams and drowsiness, and the same tired, healthy,
youthful sleep at night.

Chapter III

The farther OlÃ©nin travelled from Central Russia the farther he left his
memories behind, and the nearer he drew to the Caucasus the lighter his heart
became. âIâll stay away for good and never return to show myself in society,â
was a thought that sometimes occurred to him. âThese people whom I see here are

not
people. None of them know me and none of them can ever enter the
Moscow society I was in or find out about my past. And no one in that society
will ever know what I am doing, living among these people.â And quite a new
feeling of freedom from his whole past came over him among the rough beings he
met on the road whom he did not consider to be
people
in the sense that
his Moscow acquaintances were.

The rougher the people and the fewer the signs of civilization the freer he
felt. StavrÃ³pol, through which he had to pass, irked him. The signboards, some
of them even in French, ladies in carriages, cabs in the marketplace, and a
gentleman wearing a fur cloak and tall hat who was walking along the boulevard
and staring at the passersby, quite upset him. âPerhaps these people know some
of my acquaintances,â he thought; and the club, his tailor, cards, society ...
came back to his mind. But after StavrÃ³pol everything was satisfactoryâwild and
also beautiful and warlike, and OlÃ©nin felt happier and happier. All the
Cossacks, post-boys, and post-station masters seemed to him simple folk with
whom he could jest and converse simply, without having to consider to what
class they belonged. They all belonged to the human race which, without his
thinking about it, all appeared dear to OlÃ©nin, and they all treated him in a
friendly way.

Already in the province of the Don Cossacks his sledge had been exchanged for a
cart, and beyond StavrÃ³pol it became so warm that OlÃ©nin travelled without
wearing his fur coat. It was already springâan unexpected joyous spring for
OlÃ©nin. At night he was no longer allowed to leave the Cossack villages, and
they said it was dangerous to travel in the evening. VanyÃºsha began to be
uneasy, and they carried a loaded gun in the cart. OlÃ©nin became still happier.
At one of the post-stations the post-master told of a terrible murder that had
been committed recently on the high road. They began to meet armed men. âSo
this is where it begins!â thought OlÃ©nin, and kept expecting to see the snowy
mountains of which mention was so often made. Once, towards evening, the NogÃ¡y
driver pointed with his whip to the mountains shrouded in clouds. OlÃ©nin looked
eagerly, but it was dull and the mountains were almost hidden by the clouds.
OlÃ©nin made out something grey and white and fleecy, but try as he would he
could find nothing beautiful in the mountains of which he had so often read and
heard. The mountains and the clouds appeared to him quite alike, and he thought
the special beauty of the snow peaks, of which he had so often been told, was
as much an invention as Bachâs music and the love of women, in which he did not
believe. So he gave up looking forward to seeing the mountains. But early next
morning, being awakened in his cart by the freshness of the air, he glanced
carelessly to the right. The morning was perfectly clear. Suddenly he saw,
about twenty paces away as it seemed to him at first glance, pure white
gigantic masses with delicate contours, the distinct fantastic outlines of
their summits showing sharply against the far-off sky. When he had realized the
distance between himself and them and the sky and the whole immensity of the
mountains, and felt the infinitude of all that beauty, he became afraid that it
was but a phantasm or a dream. He gave himself a shake to rouse himself, but
the mountains were still the same.

âWhatâs that! What is it?â he said to the driver.

âWhy, the mountains,â answered the NogÃ¡y driver with indifference.

âAnd I too have been looking at them for a long while,â said VanyÃºsha. âArenât
they fine? They wonât believe it at home.â

The quick progress of the three-horsed cart along the smooth road caused the
mountains to appear to be running along the horizon, while their rosy crests
glittered in the light of the rising sun. At first OlÃ©nin was only astonished
at the sight, then gladdened by it; but later on, gazing more and more intently
at that snow-peaked chain that seemed to rise not from among other black
mountains, but straight out of the plain, and to glide away into the distance,
he began by slow degrees to be penetrated by their beauty and at length to

feel
the mountains. From that moment all he saw, all he thought, and all
he felt, acquired for him a new character, sternly majestic like the mountains!
All his Moscow reminiscences, shame, and repentance, and his trivial dreams
about the Caucasus, vanished and did not return. âNow it has begun,â a solemn
voice seemed to say to him. The road and the TÃ©rek, just becoming visible in
the distance, and the Cossack villages and the people, all no longer appeared
to him as a joke. He looked at himself or VanyÃºsha, and again thought of the

Chapter IV

That whole part of the TÃ©rek line (about fifty miles) along which lie the
villages of the GrebÃ©nsk Cossacks is uniform in character both as to country
and inhabitants. The TÃ©rek, which separates the Cossacks from the mountaineers,
still flows turbid and rapid though already broad and smooth, always depositing
greyish sand on its low reedy right bank and washing away the steep, though not
high, left bank, with its roots of century-old oaks, its rotting plane trees,
and young brushwood. On the right bank lie the villages of pro-Russian, though
still somewhat restless, Tartars. Along the left bank, back half a mile from
the river and standing five or six miles apart from one another, are Cossack
villages. In olden times most of these villages were situated on the banks of
the river; but the TÃ©rek, shifting northward from the mountains year by year,
washed away those banks, and now there remain only the ruins of the old
villages and of the gardens of pear and plum trees and poplars, all overgrown
with blackberry bushes and wild vines. No one lives there now, and one only
sees the tracks of the deer, the wolves, the hares, and the pheasants, who have
learned to love these places. From village to village runs a road cut through
the forest as a cannon-shot might fly. Along the roads are cordons of Cossacks
and watch-towers with sentinels in them. Only a narrow strip about seven
hundred yards wide of fertile wooded soil belongs to the Cossacks. To the north
of it begin the sand-drifts of the NogÃ¡y or MozdÃ³k steppes, which fetch far to
the north and run, Heaven knows where, into the TrukhmÃ©n, AstrakhÃ¡n, and
KirghÃ­z-KaisÃ¡tsk steppes. To the south, beyond the TÃ©rek, are the Great
ChÃ©chnya river, the KochkÃ¡lov range, the Black Mountains, yet another range,
and at last the snowy mountains, which can just be seen but have never yet been
scaled. In this fertile wooded strip, rich in vegetation, has dwelt as far back
as memory runs the fine warlike and prosperous Russian tribe belonging to the
sect of Old Believers, and called the GrebÃ©nsk Cossacks.

Long long ago their Old Believer ancestors fled from Russia and settled beyond
the TÃ©rek among the ChÃ©chens on the GrebÃ©n, the first range of wooded mountains
of ChÃ©chnya. Living among the ChÃ©chens the Cossacks intermarried with them and
adopted the manners and customs of the hill tribes, though they still retained
the Russian language in all its purity, as well as their Old Faith. A
tradition, still fresh among them, declares that Tsar IvÃ¡n the Terrible came to
the TÃ©rek, sent for their Elders, and gave them the land on this side of the
river, exhorting them to remain friendly to Russia and promising not to enforce
his rule upon them nor oblige them to change their faith. Even now the Cossack
families claim relationship with the ChÃ©chens, and the love of freedom, of
leisure, of plunder and of war, still form their chief characteristics. Only
the harmful side of Russian influence shows itselfâby interference at
elections, by confiscation of church bells, and by the troops who are quartered
in the country or march through it.

A Cossack is inclined to hate less the
dzhigit
hillsman who maybe has
killed his brother, than the soldier quartered on him to defend his village,
but who has defiled his hut with tobacco-smoke. He respects his enemy the
hillsman and despises the soldier, who is in his eyes an alien and an
oppressor. In reality, from a Cossackâs point of view a Russian peasant is a
foreign, savage, despicable creature, of whom he sees a sample in the hawkers
who come to the country and in the Ukrainian immigrants whom the Cossack
contemptuously calls âwoolbeatersâ. For him, to be smartly dressed means to be
dressed like a Circassian. The best weapons are obtained from the hillsmen and
the best horses are bought, or stolen, from them. A dashing young Cossack likes
to show off his knowledge of Tartar, and when carousing talks Tartar even to
his fellow Cossack.

In spite of all these things this small Christian clan stranded in a tiny
corner of the earth, surrounded by half-savage Mohammedan tribes and by
soldiers, considers itself highly advanced, acknowledges none but Cossacks as
human beings, and despises everybody else. The Cossack spends most of his time
in the cordon, in action, or in hunting and fishing. He hardly ever works at
home. When he stays in the village it is an exception to the general rule and
then he is holiday-making. All Cossacks make their own wine, and drunkenness is
not so much a general tendency as a rite, the non-fulfilment of which would be
considered apostasy. The Cossack looks upon a woman as an instrument for his
welfare; only the unmarried girls are allowed to amuse themselves. A married
woman has to work for her husband from youth to very old age: his demands on
her are the Oriental ones of submission and labour. In consequence of this
outlook women are strongly developed both physically and mentally, and though
they areâas everywhere in the Eastânominally in subjection, they possess far
greater influence and importance in family-life than Western women. Their
exclusion from public life and inurement to heavy male labour give the women
all the more power and importance in the household. A Cossack, who before
strangers considers it improper to speak affectionately or needlessly to his
wife, when alone with her is involuntarily conscious of her superiority. His
house and all his property, in fact the entire homestead, has been acquired and
is kept together solely by her labour and care. Though firmly convinced that
labour is degrading to a Cossack and is only proper for a NogÃ¡y labourer or a
woman, he is vaguely aware of the fact that all he makes use of and calls his
own is the result of that toil, and that it is in the power of the woman (his
mother or his wife) whom he considers his slave, to deprive him of all he
possesses. Besides, the continuous performance of manâs heavy work and the
responsibilities entrusted to her have endowed the GrebÃ©nsk women with a
peculiarly independent masculine character and have remarkably developed their
physical powers, common sense, resolution, and stability. The women are in most
cases stronger, more intelligent, more developed, and handsomer than the men. A
striking feature of a GrebÃ©nsk womanâs beauty is the combination of the purest
Circassian type of face with the broad and powerful build of Northern women.
Cossack women wear the Circassian dress: a Tartar smock,
beshmet
, and
soft slippers; but they tie their kerchiefs round their heads in the Russian
fashion. Smartness, cleanliness and elegance in dress and in the arrangement of
their huts, are with them a custom and a necessity. In their relations with men
the women, and especially the unmarried girls, enjoy perfect freedom.

NovomlÃ­nsk village was considered the very heart of GrebÃ©nsk Cossackdom. In it
more than elsewhere the customs of the old GrebÃ©nsk population have been
preserved, and its women have from time immemorial been renowned all over the
Caucasus for their beauty. A Cossackâs livelihood is derived from vineyards,
fruit-gardens, water melon and pumpkin plantations, from fishing, hunting,
maize and millet growing, and from war plunder. NovomlÃ­nsk village lies about
two and a half miles away from the TÃ©rek, from which it is separated by a dense
forest. On one side of the road which runs through the village is the river; on
the other, green vineyards and orchards, beyond which are seen the driftsands
of the NogÃ¡y Steppe. The village is surrounded by earth-banks and prickly
bramble hedges, and is entered by tall gates hung between posts and covered
with little reed-thatched roofs. Beside them on a wooden gun-carriage stands an
unwieldy cannon captured by the Cossacks at some time or other, and which has
not been fired for a hundred years. A uniformed Cossack sentinel with dagger
and gun sometimes stands, and sometimes does not stand, on guard beside the
gates, and sometimes presents arms to a passing officer and sometimes does not.

Below the roof of the gateway is written in black letters on a white board:
âHouses 266: male inhabitants 897: female 1012.â The Cossacksâ houses are all
raised on pillars two and a half feet from the ground. They are carefully
thatched with reeds and have large carved gables. If not new they are at least
all straight and clean, with high porches of different shapes; and they are not
built close together but have ample space around them, and are all
picturesquely placed along broad streets and lanes. In front of the large
bright windows of many of the houses, beyond the kitchen gardens, dark green
poplars and acacias with their delicate pale verdure and scented white blossoms
overtop the houses, and beside them grow flaunting yellow sunflowers, creepers,
and grape vines. In the broad open square are three shops where drapery,
sunflower and pumpkin seeds, locust beans and gingerbreads are sold; and
surrounded by a tall fence, loftier and larger than the other houses, stands
the Regimental Commanderâs dwelling with its casement windows, behind a row of
tall poplars. Few people are to be seen in the streets of the village on
weekdays, especially in summer. The young men are on duty in the cordons or on
military expeditions; the old ones are fishing or helping the women in the
orchards and gardens. Only the very old, the sick, and the children, remain at
home.

Chapter V

It was one of those wonderful evenings that occur only in the Caucasus. The sun
had sunk behind the mountains but it was still light. The evening glow had
spread over a third of the sky, and against its brilliancy the dull white
immensity of the mountains was sharply defined. The air was rarefied,
motionless, and full of sound. The shadow of the mountains reached for several
miles over the steppe. The steppe, the opposite side of the river, and the
roads, were all deserted. If very occasionally mounted men appeared, the
Cossacks in the cordon and the ChÃ©chens in their
aouls
(villages)
watched them with surprised curiosity and tried to guess who those questionable
men could be.

At nightfall people from fear of one another flock to their dwellings, and only
birds and beasts fearless of man prowl in those deserted spaces. Talking
merrily, the women who have been tying up the vines hurry away from the gardens
before sunset. The vineyards, like all the surrounding district, are deserted,
but the villages become very animated at that time of the evening. From all
sides, walking, riding, or driving in their creaking carts, people move towards
the village. Girls with their smocks tucked up and twigs in their hands run
chatting merrily to the village gates to meet the cattle that are crowding
together in a cloud of dust and mosquitoes which they bring with them from the
steppe. The well-fed cows and buffaloes disperse at a run all over the streets
and Cossack women in coloured
beshmets
go to and fro among them. You can
hear their merry laughter and shrieks mingling with the lowing of the cattle.
There an armed and mounted Cossack, on leave from the cordon, rides up to a hut
and, leaning towards the window, knocks. In answer to the knock the handsome
head of a young woman appears at the window and you can hear caressing,
laughing voices. There a tattered NogÃ¡y labourer, with prominent cheekbones,
brings a load of reeds from the steppes, turns his creaking cart into the
Cossack captainâs broad and clean courtyard, and lifts the yoke off the oxen
that stand tossing their heads while he and his master shout to one another in
Tartar. Past a puddle that reaches nearly across the street, a barefooted
Cossack woman with a bundle of firewood on her back makes her laborious way by
clinging to the fences, holding her smock high and exposing her white legs. A
Cossack returning from shooting calls out in jest: âLift it higher, shameless
thing!â and points his gun at her. The woman lets down her smock and drops the
wood. An old Cossack, returning home from fishing with his trousers tucked up
and his hairy grey chest uncovered, has a net across his shoulder containing
silvery fish that are still struggling; and to take a short cut climbs over his
neighbourâs broken fence and gives a tug to his coat which has caught on the
fence. There a woman is dragging a dry branch along and from round the corner
comes the sound of an axe. Cossack children, spinning their tops wherever there
is a smooth place in the street, are shrieking; women are climbing over fences
to avoid going round. From every chimney rises the odorous
kisyak
smoke.
From every homestead comes the sound of increased bustle, precursor to the
stillness of night.

Granny UlÃ­tka, the wife of the Cossack cornet who is also teacher in the
regimental school, goes out to the gates of her yard like the other women, and
waits for the cattle which her daughter MaryÃ¡nka is driving along the street.
Before she has had time fully to open the wattle gate in the fence, an enormous
buffalo cow surrounded by mosquitoes rushes up bellowing and squeezes in.
Several well-fed cows slowly follow her, their large eyes gazing with
recognition at their mistress as they swish their sides with their tails.

The beautiful and shapely MaryÃ¡nka enters at the gate and throwing away her
switch quickly slams the gate to and rushes with all the speed of her nimble
feet to separate and drive the cattle into their sheds. âTake off your
slippers, you devilâs wench!â shouts her mother, âyouâve worn them into holes!â
MaryÃ¡nka is not at all offended at being called a âdevilâs wenchâ, but
accepting it as a term of endearment cheerfully goes on with her task. Her face
is covered with a kerchief tied round her head. She is wearing a pink smock and
a green
beshmet
. She disappears inside the lean-to shed in the yard,
following the big fat cattle; and from the shed comes her voice as she speaks
gently and persuasively to the buffalo: âWonât she stand still? What a
creature! Come now, come old dear!â Soon the girl and the old woman pass from
the shed to the dairy carrying two large pots of milk, the dayâs yield. From
the dairy chimney rises a thin cloud of
kisyak
smoke: the milk is being
used to make into clotted cream. The girl makes up the fire while her mother
goes to the gate. Twilight has fallen on the village. The air is full of the
smell of vegetables, cattle, and scented
kisyak
smoke. From the gates
and along the streets Cossack women come running, carrying lighted rags. From
the yards one hears the snorting and quiet chewing of the cattle eased of their
milk, while in the street only the voices of women and children sound as they
call to one another. It is rare on a week-day to hear the drunken voice of a
man.

One of the Cossack wives, a tall, masculine old woman, approaches Granny UlÃ­tka
from the homestead opposite and asks her for a light. In her hand she holds a
rag.

âHave you cleared up, Granny?â

âThe girl is lighting the fire. Is it fire you want?â says Granny UlÃ­tka, proud
of being able to oblige her neighbour.

Both women enter the hut, and coarse hands unused to dealing with small
articles tremblingly lift the lid of a matchbox, which is a rarity in the
Caucasus. The masculine-looking new-comer sits down on the doorstep with the
evident intention of having a chat.

âAnd is your man at the school, Mother?â she asked.

âHeâs always teaching the youngsters, Mother. But he writes that heâll come
home for the holidays,â said the cornetâs wife.

âYes, heâs a clever man, one sees; it all comes useful.â

âOf course it does.â

âAnd my LukÃ¡shka is at the cordon; they wonât let him come home,â said the
visitor, though the cornetâs wife had known all this long ago. She wanted to
talk about her LukÃ¡shka whom she had lately fitted out for service in the
Cossack regiment, and whom she wished to marry to the cornetâs daughter,
MaryÃ¡nka.

âSo heâs at the cordon?â

âHe is, Mother. Heâs not been home since last holidays. The other day I sent
him some shirts by FÃ³mushkin. He says heâs all right, and that his superiors
are satisfied. He says they are looking out for
abreks
again. LukÃ¡shka
is quite happy, he says.â

âAh well, thank God,â said the cornetâs wife. ââSnatcherâ is certainly the only
word for him.â LukÃ¡shka was surnamed âthe Snatcherâ because of his bravery in
snatching a boy from a watery grave, and the cornetâs wife alluded to this,
wishing in her turn to say something agreeable to LukÃ¡shkaâs mother.

âI thank God, Mother, that heâs a good son! Heâs a fine fellow, everyone
praises him,â says LukÃ¡shkaâs mother. âAll I wish is to get him married; then I
could die in peace.â

âWell, arenât there plenty of young women in the village?â answered the
cornetâs wife slyly as she carefully replaced the lid of the matchbox with her
horny hands.

âPlenty, Mother, plenty,â remarked LukÃ¡shkaâs mother, shaking her head.
âThereâs your girl now, your MaryÃ¡nkaâthatâs the sort of girl! Youâd have to
search through the whole place to find such another!â The cornetâs wife knows
what LukÃ¡shkaâs mother is after, but though she believes him to be a good
Cossack she hangs back: first because she is a cornetâs wife and rich, while
LukÃ¡shka is the son of a simple Cossack and fatherless, secondly because she
does not want to part with her daughter yet, but chiefly because propriety
demands it.

âWell, when MaryÃ¡nka grows up sheâll be marriageable too,â she answers soberly
and modestly.

âIâll send the matchmakers to youâIâll send them! Only let me get the vineyard
done and then weâll come and make our bows to you,â says LukÃ¡shkaâs mother.
âAnd weâll make our bows to Elias VasÃ­lich too.â

âElias, indeed!â says the cornetâs wife proudly. âItâs to me you must speak!
All in its own good time.â

LukÃ¡shkaâs mother sees by the stern face of the cornetâs wife that it is not
the time to say anything more just now, so she lights her rag with the match
and says, rising: âDonât refuse us, think of my words. Iâll go, it is time to
light the fire.â

As she crosses the road swinging the burning rag, she meets MaryÃ¡nka, who bows.

âAh, sheâs a regular queen, a splendid worker, that girl!â she thinks, looking
at the beautiful maiden. âWhat need for her to grow any more? Itâs time she was
married and to a good home; married to LukÃ¡shka!â

But Granny UlÃ­tka had her own cares and she remained sitting on the threshold
thinking hard about something, till the girl called her.

Chapter VI

The male population of the village spend their time on military expeditions and
in the cordonâor âat their postsâ, as the Cossacks say. Towards evening, that
same LukÃ¡shka the Snatcher, about whom the old women had been talking, was
standing on a watch-tower of the NÃ­zhni-ProtÃ³tsk post situated on the very
banks of the TÃ©rek. Leaning on the railing of the tower and screwing up his
eyes, he looked now far into the distance beyond the TÃ©rek, now down at his
fellow Cossacks, and occasionally he addressed the latter. The sun was already
approaching the snowy range that gleamed white above the fleecy clouds. The
clouds undulating at the base of the mountains grew darker and darker. The
clearness of evening was noticeable in the air. A sense of freshness came from
the woods, though round the post it was still hot. The voices of the talking
Cossacks vibrated more sonorously than before. The moving mass of the TÃ©rekâs
rapid brown waters contrasted more vividly with its motionless banks. The
waters were beginning to subside and here and there the wet sands gleamed drab
on the banks and in the shallows. The other side of the river, just opposite
the cordon, was deserted; only an immense waste of low-growing reeds stretched
far away to the very foot of the mountains. On the low bank, a little to one
side, could be seen the flat-roofed clay houses and the funnel-shaped chimneys
of a ChÃ©chen village. The sharp eyes of the Cossack who stood on the
watch-tower followed, through the evening smoke of the pro-Russian village, the
tiny moving figures of the ChÃ©chen women visible in the distance in their red
and blue garments.

Although the Cossacks expected
abreks
to cross over and attack them from
the Tartar side at any moment, especially as it was May when the woods by the
TÃ©rek are so dense that it is difficult to pass through them on foot and the
river is shallow enough in places for a horseman to ford it, and despite the
fact that a couple of days before a Cossack had arrived with a circular from
the commander of the regiment announcing that spies had reported the intention
of a party of some eight men to cross the TÃ©rek, and ordering special
vigilanceâno special vigilance was being observed in the cordon. The Cossacks,
unarmed and with their horses unsaddled just as if they were at home, spent
their time some in fishing, some in drinking, and some in hunting. Only the
horse of the man on duty was saddled, and with its feet hobbled was moving
about by the brambles near the wood, and only the sentinel had his Circassian
coat on and carried a gun and sword. The corporal, a tall thin Cossack with an
exceptionally long back and small hands and feet, was sitting on the earth-bank
of a hut with his
beshmet
unbuttoned. On his face was the lazy, bored
expression of a superior, and having shut his eyes he dropped his head upon the
palm first of one hand and then of the other. An elderly Cossack with a broad
greyish-black beard was lying in his shirt, girdled with a black strap, close
to the river and gazing lazily at the waves of the TÃ©rek as they monotonously
foamed and swirled. Others, also overcome by the heat and half naked, were
rinsing clothes in the TÃ©rek, plaiting a fishing line, or humming tunes as they
lay on the hot sand of the river bank. One Cossack, with a thin face much burnt
by the sun, lay near the hut evidently dead drunk, by a wall which though it
had been in shadow some two hours previously was now exposed to the sunâs
fierce slanting rays.

LukÃ¡shka, who stood on the watch-tower, was a tall handsome lad about twenty
years old and very like his mother. His face and whole build, in spite of the
angularity of youth, indicated great strength, both physical and moral. Though
he had only lately joined the Cossacks at the front, it was evident from the
expression of his face and the calm assurance of his attitude that he had
already acquired the somewhat proud and warlike bearing peculiar to Cossacks
and to men generally who continually carry arms, and that he felt he was a
Cossack and fully knew his own value. His ample Circassian coat was torn in
some places, his cap was on the back of his head ChÃ©chen fashion, and his
leggings had slipped below his knees. His clothing was not rich, but he wore it
with that peculiar Cossack foppishness which consists in imitating the ChÃ©chen
brave. Everything on a real brave is ample, ragged, and neglected, only his
weapons are costly. But these ragged clothes and these weapons are belted and
worn with a certain air and matched in a certain manner, neither of which can
be acquired by everybody and which at once strike the eye of a Cossack or a
hillsman. LukÃ¡shka had this resemblance to a brave. With his hands folded under
his sword, and his eyes nearly closed, he kept looking at the distant Tartar
village. Taken separately his features were not beautiful, but anyone who saw
his stately carriage and his dark-browed intelligent face would involuntarily
say, âWhat a fine fellow!â

âLook at the women, what a lot of them are walking about in the village,â said
he in a sharp voice, languidly showing his brilliant white teeth and not
addressing anyone in particular.

NazÃ¡rka who was lying below immediately lifted his head and remarked:

âThey must be going for water.â

âSupposing one scared them with a gun?â said LukÃ¡shka, laughing, âWouldnât they
be frightened?â

âIt wouldnât reach.â

âWhat! Mine would carry beyond. Just wait a bit, and when their feast comes
round Iâll go and visit GirÃ©y Khan and drink
buza
there,â said LukÃ¡shka,
angrily swishing away the mosquitoes which attached themselves to him.

A rustling in the thicket drew the Cossackâs attention. A pied mongrel
half-setter, searching for a scent and violently wagging its scantily furred
tail, came running to the cordon. LukÃ¡shka recognized the dog as one belonging
to his neighbour, Uncle ErÃ³shka, a hunter, and saw, following it through the
thicket, the approaching figure of the hunter himself.

Uncle ErÃ³shka was a gigantic Cossack with a broad, snow-white beard and such
broad shoulders and chest that in the wood, where there was no one to compare
him with, he did not look particularly tall, so well proportioned were his
powerful limbs. He wore a tattered coat and, over the bands with which his legs
were swathed, sandals made of undressed deerâs hide tied on with strings; while
on his head he had a rough little white cap. He carried over one shoulder a
screen to hide behind when shooting pheasants, and a bag containing a hen for
luring hawks, and a small falcon; over the other shoulder, attached by a strap,
was a wild cat he had killed; and stuck in his belt behind were some little
bags containing bullets, gunpowder, and bread, a horseâs tail to swish away the
mosquitoes, a large dagger in a torn scabbard smeared with old bloodstains, and
two dead pheasants. Having glanced at the cordon he stopped.

âHy, Lyam!â he called to the dog in such a ringing bass that it awoke an echo
far away in the wood; and throwing over his shoulder his big gun, of the kind
the Cossacks call a âflintâ, he raised his cap.

âHad a good day, good people, eh?â he said, addressing the Cossacks in the same
strong and cheerful voice, quite without effort, but as loudly as if he were
shouting to someone on the other bank of the river.

âYes, yes, Uncle!â answered from all sides the voices of the young Cossacks.

âWhat have you seen? Tell us!â shouted Uncle ErÃ³shka, wiping the sweat from his
broad red face with the sleeve of his coat.

âAh, thereâs a vulture living in the plane tree here, Uncle. As soon as night
comes he begins hovering round,â said NazÃ¡rka, winking and jerking his shoulder
and leg.

âCome, come!â said the old man incredulously.

âReally, Uncle! You must keep watch,â replied NazÃ¡rka with a laugh.

The other Cossacks began laughing.

The wag had not seen any vulture at all, but it had long been the custom of the
young Cossacks in the cordon to tease and mislead Uncle ErÃ³shka every time he
came to them.

âEh, you fool, always lying!â exclaimed LukÃ¡shka from the tower to NazÃ¡rka.

NazÃ¡rka was immediately silenced.

âIt must be watched. Iâll watch,â answered the old man to the great delight of
all the Cossacks. âBut have you seen any boars?â

âWatching for boars, are you?â said the corporal, bending forward and
scratching his back with both hands, very pleased at the chance of some
distraction. âItâs
abreks
one has to hunt here and not boars! Youâve not
heard anything, Uncle, have you?â he added, needlessly screwing up his eyes and
showing his close-set white teeth.

â
Abreks
,â said the old man. âNo, I havenât. I say, have you any

chikhir?
Let me have a drink, thereâs a good man. Iâm really quite done
up. When the time comes Iâll bring you some fresh meat, I really will. Give me
a drink!â he added.

âWell, and are you going to watch?â inquired the corporal, as though he had not
heard what the other said.

âI did mean to watch tonight,â replied Uncle ErÃ³shka. âMaybe, with Godâs help,
I shall kill something for the holiday. Then you shall have a share, you shall
indeed!â

âUncle! Hallo, Uncle!â called out LukÃ¡shka sharply from above, attracting
everybodyâs attention. All the Cossacks looked up at him. âJust go to the upper
water-course, thereâs a fine herd of boars there. Iâm not inventing, really!
The other day one of our Cossacks shot one there. Iâm telling you the truth,â
added he, readjusting the musket at his back and in a tone that showed he was
not joking.

âAh! LukÃ¡shka the Snatcher is here!â said the old man, looking up. âWhere has
he been shooting?â

âHavenât you seen? I suppose youâre too young!â said LukÃ¡shka. âClose by the
ditch,â he went on seriously with a shake of the head. âWe were just going
along the ditch when all at once we heard something crackling, but my gun was
in its case. Elias fired suddenly ... But Iâll show you the place, itâs not
far. You just wait a bit. I know every one of their footpaths ... Daddy MÃ³sev,â
said he, turning resolutely and almost commandingly to the corporal, âitâs time
to relieve guard!â and holding aloft his gun he began to descend from the
watch-tower without waiting for the order.

âCome down!â said the corporal, after LukÃ¡shka had started, and glanced round.
âIs it your turn, GÃºrka? Then go ... True enough your LukÃ¡shka has become very
skilful,â he went on, addressing the old man. âHe keeps going about just like
you, he doesnât stay at home. The other day he killed a boar.â

Chapter VII

The sun had already set and the shades of night were rapidly spreading from the
edge of the wood. The Cossacks finished their task round the cordon and
gathered in the hut for supper. Only the old man still stayed under the plane
tree watching for the vulture and pulling the string tied to the falconâs leg,
but though a vulture was really perching on the plane tree it declined to swoop
down on the lure. LukÃ¡shka, singing one song after another, was leisurely
placing nets among the very thickest brambles to trap pheasants. In spite of
his tall stature and big hands every kind of work, both rough and delicate,
prospered under LukÃ¡shkaâs fingers.

âHallo, Luke!â came NazÃ¡rkaâs shrill, sharp voice calling him from the thicket
close by. âThe Cossacks have gone in to supper.â

NazÃ¡rka, with a live pheasant under his arm, forced his way through the
brambles and emerged on the footpath.

âOh!â said LukÃ¡shka, breaking off in his song, âwhere did you get that cock
pheasant? I suppose it was in my trap?â

NazÃ¡rka was of the same age as LukÃ¡shka and had also only been at the front
since the previous spring.

He was plain, thin and puny, with a shrill voice that rang in oneâs ears. They
were neighbours and comrades. LukÃ¡shka was sitting on the grass cross-legged
like a Tartar, adjusting his nets.

âI donât know whose it wasâyours, I expect.â

âWas it beyond the pit by the plane tree? Then it is mine! I set the nets last
night.â

LukÃ¡shka rose and examined the captured pheasant. After stroking the dark
burnished head of the bird, which rolled its eyes and stretched out its neck in
terror, LukÃ¡shka took the pheasant in his hands.

âWeâll have it in a pilau tonight. You go and kill and pluck it.â

âAnd shall we eat it ourselves or give it to the corporal?â

âHe has plenty!â

âI donât like killing them,â said NazÃ¡rka.

âGive it here!â

LukÃ¡shka drew a little knife from under his dagger and gave it a swift jerk.
The bird fluttered, but before it could spread its wings the bleeding head bent
and quivered.

âThatâs how one should do it!â said LukÃ¡shka, throwing down the pheasant. âIt
will make a fat pilau.â

NazÃ¡rka shuddered as he looked at the bird.

âI say, LukÃ¡shka, that fiend will be sending us to the ambush again tonight,â
he said, taking up the bird. (He was alluding to the corporal.) âHe has sent
FÃ³mushkin to get wine, and it ought to be his turn. He always puts it on us.â

LukÃ¡shka went whistling along the cordon.

âTake the string with you,â he shouted.

Nazirka obeyed.

âIâll give him a bit of my mind today, I really will,â continued NazÃ¡rka.
âLetâs say we wonât go; weâre tired out and thereâs an end of it! No, really,
you tell him, heâll listen to you. Itâs too bad!â

âGet along with you! What a thing to make a fuss about!â said LukÃ¡shka,
evidently thinking of something else. âWhat bosh! If he made us turn out of the
village at night now, that would be annoying: there one can have some fun, but
here what is there? Itâs all one whether weâre in the cordon or in ambush. What
a fellow you are!â

âAnd are you going to the village?â

âIâll go for the holidays.â

âGÃºrka says your DunÃ¡yka is carrying on with FÃ³mushkin,â said NazÃ¡rka suddenly.

âWell, let her go to the devil,â said LukÃ¡shka, showing his regular white
teeth, though he did not laugh. âAs if I couldnât find another!â

âGÃºrka says he went to her house. Her husband was out and there was FÃ³mushkin
sitting and eating pie. GÃºrka stopped awhile and then went away, and passing by
the window he heard her say, âHeâs gone, the fiend.... Why donât you eat your
pie, my own? You neednât go home for the night,â she says. And GÃºrka under the
window says to himself, âThatâs fine!ââ

âYouâre making it up.â

âNo, quite true, by Heaven!â

âWell, if sheâs found another let her go to the devil,â said LukÃ¡shka, after a
pause. âThereâs no lack of girls and I was sick of her anyway.â

âWell, see what a devil you are!â said NazÃ¡rka. âYou should make up to the
cornetâs girl, MaryÃ¡nka. Why doesnât she walk out with any one?â

LukÃ¡shka frowned. âWhat of MaryÃ¡nka? Theyâre all alike,â said he.

âWell, you just try...â

âWhat do you think? Are girls so scarce in the village?â

And LukÃ¡shka recommenced whistling, and went along the cordon pulling leaves
and branches from the bushes as he went. Suddenly, catching sight of a smooth
sapling, he drew the knife from the handle of his dagger and cut it down. âWhat
a ramrod it will make,â he said, swinging the sapling till it whistled through
the air.

The Cossacks were sitting round a low Tartar table on the earthen floor of the
clay-plastered outer room of the hut, when the question of whose turn it was to
lie in ambush was raised. âWho is to go tonight?â shouted one of the Cossacks
through the open door to the corporal in the next room.

âWho is to go?â the corporal shouted back. âUncle BurlÃ¡k has been and FÃ³mushkin
too,â said he, not quite confidently. âYou two had better go, you and NazÃ¡rka,â
he went on, addressing LukÃ¡shka. âAnd ErgushÃ³v must go too; surely he has slept
it off?â

âYou donât sleep it off yourself so why should he?â said NazÃ¡rka in a subdued
voice.

The Cossacks laughed.

ErgushÃ³v was the Cossack who had been lying drunk and asleep near the hut. He
had only that moment staggered into the room rubbing his eyes.

LukÃ¡shka had already risen and was getting his gun ready.

âBe quick and go! Finish your supper and go!â said the corporal; and without
waiting for an expression of consent he shut the door, evidently not expecting
the Cossack to obey. âOf course,â thought he, âif I hadnât been ordered to I
wouldnât send anyone, but an officer might turn up at any moment. As it is,
they say eight
abreks
have crossed over.â

âWell, I suppose I must go,â remarked ErgushÃ³v, âitâs the regulation. Canât be
helped! The times are such. I say, we must go.â

Meanwhile LukÃ¡shka, holding a big piece of pheasant to his mouth with both
hands and glancing now at NazÃ¡rka, now at ErgushÃ³v, seemed quite indifferent to
what passed and only laughed at them both. Before the Cossacks were ready to go
into ambush. Uncle ErÃ³shka, who had been vainly waiting under the plane tree
till night fell, entered the dark outer room.

âWell, lads,â his loud bass resounded through the low-roofed room drowning all
the other voices, âIâm going with you. Youâll watch for ChÃ©chens and I for
boars!â

Chapter VIII

It was quite dark when Uncle ErÃ³shka and the three Cossacks, in their cloaks
and shouldering their guns, left the cordon and went towards the place on the
TÃ©rek where they were to lie in ambush. NazÃ¡rka did not want to go at all, but
LukÃ¡shka shouted at him and they soon started. After they had gone a few steps
in silence the Cossacks turned aside from the ditch and went along a path
almost hidden by reeds till they reached the river. On its bank lay a thick
black log cast up by the water. The reeds around it had been recently beaten
down.

âShall we lie here?â asked NazÃ¡rka.

âWhy not?â answered LukÃ¡shka. âSit down here and Iâll be back in a minute. Iâll
only show Daddy where to go.â

âThis is the best place; here we can see and not be seen,â said ErgushÃ³v, âso
itâs here weâll lie. Itâs a first-rate place!â

NazÃ¡rka and ErgushÃ³v spread out their cloaks and settled down behind the log,
while LukÃ¡shka went on with Uncle ErÃ³shka.

âItâs not far from here. Daddy,â said LukÃ¡shka, stepping softly in front of the
old man; âIâll show you where theyâve beenâIâm the only one that knows, Daddy.â

âShow me! Youâre a fine fellow, a regular Snatcher!â replied the old man, also
whispering.

Having gone a few steps LukÃ¡shka stopped, stooped down over a puddle, and
whistled. âThatâs where they come to drink, dâyou see?â He spoke in a scarcely
audible voice, pointing to fresh hoof-prints.

âChrist bless you,â answered the old man. âThe boar will be in the hollow
beyond the ditch,â he added. âIâll watch, and you can go.â

LukÃ¡shka pulled his cloak up higher and walked back alone, throwing swift
glances now to the left at the wall of reeds, now to the TÃ©rek rushing by below
the bank. âI daresay heâs watching or creeping along somewhere,â thought he of
a possible ChÃ©chen hillsman. Suddenly a loud rustling and a splash in the water
made him start and seize his musket. From under the bank a boar leapt upâhis
dark outline showing for a moment against the glassy surface of the water and
then disappearing among the reeds. LukÃ¡shka pulled out his gun and aimed, but
before he could fire the boar had disappeared in the thicket. LukÃ¡shka spat
with vexation and went on. On approaching the ambuscade he halted again and
whistled softly. His whistle was answered and he stepped up to his comrades.

NazÃ¡rka, all curled up, was already asleep. ErgushÃ³v sat with his legs crossed
and moved slightly to make room for LukÃ¡shka.

âHow jolly it is to sit here! Itâs really a good place,â said he. âDid you take
him there?â

âShowed him where,â answered LukÃ¡shka, spreading out his cloak. âBut what a big
boar I roused just now close to the water! I expect it was the very one! You
must have heard the crash?â

âI did hear a beast crashing through. I knew at once it was a beast. I thought
to myself: âLukÃ¡shka has roused a beast,ââ ErgushÃ³v said, wrapping himself up
in his cloak. âNow Iâll go to sleep,â he added. âWake me when the cocks crow.
We must have discipline. Iâll lie down and have a nap, and then you will have a
nap and Iâll watchâthatâs the way.â

âLuckily I donât want to sleep,â answered LukÃ¡shka.

The night was dark, warm, and still. Only on one side of the sky the stars were
shining, the other and greater part was overcast by one huge cloud stretching
from the mountaintops. The black cloud, blending in the absence of any wind
with the mountains, moved slowly onwards, its curved edges sharply defined
against the deep starry sky. Only in front of him could the Cossack discern the
TÃ©rek and the distance beyond. Behind and on both sides he was surrounded by a
wall of reeds. Occasionally the reeds would sway and rustle against one another
apparently without cause. Seen from down below, against the clear part of the
sky, their waving tufts looked like the feathery branches of trees. Close in
front at his very feet was the bank, and at its base the rushing torrent. A
little farther on was the moving mass of glassy brown water which eddied
rhythmically along the bank and round the shallows. Farther still, water,
banks, and cloud all merged together in impenetrable gloom. Along the surface
of the water floated black shadows, in which the experienced eyes of the
Cossack detected trees carried down by the current. Only very rarely
sheet-lightning, mirrored in the water as in a black glass, disclosed the
sloping bank opposite. The rhythmic sounds of nightâthe rustling of the reeds,
the snoring of the Cossacks, the hum of mosquitoes, and the rushing water, were
every now and then broken by a shot fired in the distance, or by the gurgling
of water when a piece of bank slipped down, the splash of a big fish, or the
crashing of an animal breaking through the thick undergrowth in the wood. Once
an owl flew past along the TÃ©rek, flapping one wing against the other
rhythmically at every second beat. Just above the Cossackâs head it turned
towards the wood and then, striking its wings no longer after every other flap
but at every flap, it flew to an old plane tree where it rustled about for a
long time before settling down among the branches. At every one of these
unexpected sounds the watching Cossack listened intently, straining his
hearing, and screwing up his eyes while he deliberately felt for his musket.

The greater part of the night was past. The black cloud that had moved westward
revealed the clear starry sky from under its torn edge, and the golden upturned
crescent of the moon shone above the mountains with a reddish light. The cold
began to be penetrating. NazÃ¡rka awoke, spoke a little, and fell asleep again.
LukÃ¡shka feeling bored got up, drew the knife from his dagger-handle and began
to fashion his stick into a ramrod. His head was full of the ChÃ©chens who lived
over there in the mountains, and of how their brave lads came across and were
not afraid of the Cossacks, and might even now be crossing the river at some
other spot. He thrust himself out of his hiding-place and looked along the
river but could see nothing. And as he continued looking out at intervals upon
the river and at the opposite bank, now dimly distinguishable from the water in
the faint moonlight, he no longer thought about the ChÃ©chens but only of when
it would be time to wake his comrades, and of going home to the village. In the
village he imagined DunÃ¡yka, his âlittle soulâ, as the Cossacks call a manâs
mistress, and thought of her with vexation. Silvery mists, a sign of coming
morning, glittered white above the water, and not far from him young eagles
were whistling and flapping their wings. At last the crowing of a cock reached
him from the distant village, followed by the long-sustained note of another,
which was again answered by yet other voices.

âTime to wake them,â thought LukÃ¡shka, who had finished his ramrod and felt his
eyes growing heavy. Turning to his comrades he managed to make out which pair
of legs belonged to whom, when it suddenly seemed to him that he heard
something splash on the other side of the TÃ©rek. He turned again towards the
horizon beyond the hills, where day was breaking under the upturned crescent,
glanced at the outline of the opposite bank, at the TÃ©rek, and at the now
distinctly visible driftwood upon it. For one instant it seemed to him that he
was moving and that the TÃ©rek with the drifting wood remained stationary. Again
he peered out. One large black log with a branch particularly attracted his
attention. The tree was floating in a strange way right down the middle of the
stream, neither rocking nor whirling. It even appeared not to be floating
altogether with the current, but to be crossing it in the direction of the
shallows. LukÃ¡shka stretching out his neck watched it intently. The tree
floated to the shallows, stopped, and shifted in a peculiar manner. LukÃ¡shka
thought he saw an arm stretched out from beneath the tree.

âSupposing I killed an
abrek
all by myself!â he thought, and seized his
gun with a swift, unhurried movement, putting up his gun-rest, placing the gun
upon it, and holding it noiselessly in position. Cocking the trigger, with
bated breath he took aim, still peering out intently.

âI wonât wake them,â he thought. But his heart began beating so fast that he
remained motionless, listening. Suddenly the trunk gave a plunge and again
began to float across the stream towards our bank.

âSuppose I miss?...â thought he, and now by the faint light of the moon he
caught a glimpse of a Tartarâs head in front of the floating wood. He aimed
straight at the head which appeared to be quite nearâjust at the end of his
rifleâs barrel. He glanced cross. âRight enough it is an
abrek!
â he
thought joyfully, and suddenly rising to his knees he again took aim. Having
found the sight, barely visible at the end of the long gun, he said: âIn the
name of the Father and of the Son,â in the Cossack way learnt in his childhood,
and pulled the trigger. A flash of lightning lit up for an instant the reeds
and the water, and the sharp, abrupt report of the shot was carried across the
river, changing into a prolonged roll somewhere in the far distance. The piece
of driftwood now floated not across, but with the current, rocking and
whirling.

âStop, I say!â exclaimed ErgushÃ³v, seizing his musket and raising himself
behind the log near which he was lying.

âShut up, you devil!â whispered LukÃ¡shka, grinding his teeth. â
Abreks!
â

âWhom have you shot?â asked NazÃ¡rka. âWho was it, LukÃ¡shka?â

LukÃ¡shka did not answer. He was reloading his gun and watching the floating
wood. A little way off it stopped on a sand-bank, and from behind it something
large that rocked in the water came into view.

âWhat did you shoot? Why donât you speak?â insisted the Cossacks.

â
Abreks
, I tell you!â said LukÃ¡shka.

âDonât humbug! Did the gun go off? ...â

âIâve killed an
abrek
, thatâs what I fired at,â muttered LukÃ¡shka in a
voice choked by emotion, as he jumped to his feet. âA man was swimming...â he
said, pointing to the sandbank. âI killed him. Just look there.â

âHave done with your humbugging!â said ErgushÃ³v again, rubbing his eyes.

âHave done with what? Look there,â said LukÃ¡shka, seizing him by the shoulders
and pulling him with such force that ErgushÃ³v groaned.

He looked in the direction in which LukÃ¡shka pointed, and discerning a body
immediately changed his tone.

âO Lord! But I say, more will come! I tell you the truth,â said he softly, and
began examining his musket. âThat was a scout swimming across: either the
others are here already or are not far off on the other sideâI tell you for
sure!â LukÃ¡shka was unfastening his belt and taking off his Circassian coat.

âWhat are you up to, you idiot?â exclaimed ErgushÃ³v. âOnly show yourself and
youâve lost all for nothing, I tell you true! If youâve killed him he wonât
escape. Let me have a little powder for my musket-panâyou have some? NazÃ¡rka,
you go back to the cordon and look alive; but donât go along the bank or youâll
be killedâI tell you true.â

âCatch me going alone! Go yourself!â said NazÃ¡rka angrily.

Having taken off his coat, LukÃ¡shka went down to the bank.

âDonât go in, I tell you!â said ErgushÃ³v, putting some powder on the pan.
âLook, heâs not moving. I can see. Itâs nearly morning; wait till they come
from the cordon. You go, NazÃ¡rka. Youâre afraid! Donât be afraid, I tell you.â

âLuke, I say, LukÃ¡shka! Tell us how you did it!â said NazÃ¡rka.

LukÃ¡shka changed his mind about going into the water just then. âGo quick to
the cordon and I will watch. Tell the Cossacks to send out the patrol. If the

abreks
are on this side they must be caught,â said he.

âThatâs what I say. Theyâll get off,â said ErgushÃ³v, rising. âTrue, they must
be caught!â

ErgushÃ³v and NazÃ¡rka rose and, crossing themselves, started off for the
cordonânot along the riverbank but breaking their way through the brambles to
reach a path in the wood.

âNow mind, LukÃ¡shkaâthey may cut you down here, so youâd best keep a sharp
look-out, I tell you!â

âGo along; I know,â muttered LukÃ¡shka; and having examined his gun again he sat
down behind the log.

He remained alone and sat gazing at the shallows and listening for the
Cossacks; but it was some distance to the cordon and he was tormented by
impatience. He kept thinking that the other
abreks
who were with the one
he had killed would escape. He was vexed with the
abreks
who were going
to escape just as he had been with the boar that had escaped the evening
before. He glanced round and at the opposite bank, expecting every moment to
see a man, and having arranged his gun-rest he was ready to fire. The idea that
he might himself be killed never entered his head.

Chapter IX

It was growing light. The ChÃ©chenâs body which was gently rocking in the
shallow water was now clearly visible. Suddenly the reeds rustled not far from
Luke and he heard steps and saw the feathery tops of the reeds moving. He set
his gun at full cock and muttered: âIn the name of the Father and of the Son,â
but when the cock clicked the sound of steps ceased.

âHallo, Cossacks! Donât kill your Daddy!â said a deep bass voice calmly; and
moving the reeds apart Daddy ErÃ³shka came up close to Luke.

âI very nearly killed you, by God I did!â said LukÃ¡shka.

âWhat have you shot?â asked the old man.

His sonorous voice resounded through the wood and downward along the river,
suddenly dispelling the mysterious quiet of night around the Cossack. It was as
if everything had suddenly become lighter and more distinct.

âThere now. Uncle, you have not seen anything, but Iâve killed a beast,â said
LukÃ¡shka, uncocking his gun and getting up with unnatural calmness.

The old man was staring intently at the white back, now clearly visible,
against which the TÃ©rek rippled.

âHe was swimming with a log on his back. I spied him out! ... Look there.
There! Heâs got blue trousers, and a gun I think.... Do you see?â inquired
Luke.

âHow can one help seeing?â said the old man angrily, and a serious and stern
expression appeared on his face. âYouâve killed a brave,â he said, apparently
with regret.

âWell, I sat here and suddenly saw something dark on the other side. I spied
him when he was still over there. It was as if a man had come there and fallen
in. Strange! And a piece of driftwood, a good-sized piece, comes floating, not
with the stream but across it; and what do I see but a head appearing from
under it! Strange! I stretched out of the reeds but could see nothing; then I
rose and he must have heard, the beast, and crept out into the shallow and
looked about. âNo, you donât!â I said, as soon as he landed and looked round,
âyou wonât get away!â Oh, there was something choking me! I got my gun ready
but did not stir, and looked out. He waited a little and then swam out again;
and when he came into the moonlight I could see his whole back. âIn the name of
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghostâ... and through the smoke I see
him struggling. He moaned, or so it seemed to me. âAh,â I thought, âthe Lord be
thanked, Iâve killed him!â And when he drifted onto the sand-bank I could see
him distinctly: he tried to get up but couldnât. He struggled a bit and then
lay down. Everything could be seen. Look, he does not moveâhe must be dead! The
Cossacks have gone back to the cordon in case there should be any more of
them.â

âAnd so you got him!â said the old man. âHe is far away now, my lad! ...â And
again he shook his head sadly.

Just then the sound reached them of breaking bushes and the loud voices of
Cossacks approaching along the bank on horseback and on foot. âAre you bringing
the skiff?â shouted LukÃ¡shka.

âYouâre a trump, Luke! Lug it to the bank!â shouted one of the Cossacks.

Without waiting for the skiff LukÃ¡shka began to undress, keeping an eye all the
while on his prey.

âWait a bit, NazÃ¡rka is bringing the skiff,â shouted the corporal.

âYou fool! Maybe he is alive and only pretending! Take your dagger with you!â
shouted another Cossack.

âGet along,â cried Luke, pulling off his trousers. He quickly undressed and,
crossing himself, jumped, plunging with a splash into the river. Then with long
strokes of his white arms, lifting his back high out of the water and breathing
deeply, he swam across the current of the TÃ©rek towards the shallows. A crowd
of Cossacks stood on the bank talking loudly. Three horsemen rode off to
patrol. The skiff appeared round a bend. LukÃ¡shka stood up on the sandbank,
leaned over the body, and gave it a couple of shakes.

âQuite dead!â he shouted in a shrill voice.

The ChÃ©chen had been shot in the head. He had on a pair of blue trousers, a
shirt, and a Circassian coat, and a gun and dagger were tied to his back. Above
all these a large branch was tied, and it was this which at first had misled
LukÃ¡shka.

âWhat a carp youâve landed!â cried one of the Cossacks who had assembled in a
circle, as the body, lifted out of the skiff, was laid on the bank, pressing
down the grass.

âHow yellow he is!â said another.

âWhere have our fellows gone to search? I expect the rest of them are on the
other bank. If this one had not been a scout he would not have swum that way.
Why else should he swim alone?â said a third.

âMust have been a smart one to offer himself before the others; a regular
brave!â said LukÃ¡shka mockingly, shivering as he wrung out his clothes that had
got wet on the bank.

âHis beard is dyed and cropped.â

âAnd he has tied a bag with a coat in it to his back.â

âThat would make it easier for him to swim,â said some one.

âI say, LukÃ¡shka,â said the corporal, who was holding the dagger and gun taken
from the dead man. âKeep the dagger for yourself and the coat too; but Iâll
give you three rubles for the gun. You see it has a hole in it,â said he,
blowing into the muzzle. âI want it just for a souvenir.â

LukÃ¡shka did not answer. Evidently this sort of begging vexed him but he knew
it could not be avoided.

âSee, what a devil!â said he, frowning and throwing down the ChÃ©chenâs coat.
âIf at least it were a good coat, but itâs a mere rag.â

âItâll do to fetch firewood in,â said one of the Cossacks.

âMÃ³sev, Iâll go home,â said LukÃ¡shka, evidently forgetting his vexation and
wishing to get some advantage out of having to give a present to his superior.

âAll right, you may go!â

âTake the body beyond the cordon, lads,â said the corporal, still examining the
gun, âand put a shelter over him from the sun. Perhaps theyâll send from the
mountains to ransom it.â

âIt isnât hot yet,â said someone.

âAnd supposing a jackal tears him? Would that be well?â remarked another
Cossack.

âWeâll set a watch; if they should come to ransom him it wonât do for him to
have been torn.â

âWell, LukÃ¡shka, whatever you do you must stand a pail of vodka for the lads,â
said the corporal gaily.

âOf course! Thatâs the custom,â chimed in the Cossacks. âSee what luck God has
sent you! Without ever having seen anything of the kind before, youâve killed a
brave!â

âBuy the dagger and coat and donât be stingy, and Iâll let you have the
trousers too,â said LukÃ¡shka. âTheyâre too tight for me; he was a thin devil.â

One Cossack bought the coat for a ruble and another gave the price of two pails
of vodka for the dagger.

âDrink, lads! Iâll stand you a pail!â said Luke. âIâll bring it myself from the
village.â

âAnd cut up the trousers into kerchiefs for the girls!â said NazÃ¡rka.

The Cossacks burst out laughing.

âHave done laughing!â said the corporal. âAnd take the body away. Why have you
put the nasty thing by the hut?â

âWhat are you standing there for? Haul him along, lads!â shouted LukÃ¡shka in a
commanding voice to the Cossacks, who reluctantly took hold of the body,
obeying him as though he were their chief. After dragging the body along for a
few steps the Cossacks let fall the legs, which dropped with a lifeless jerk,
and stepping apart they then stood silent for a few moments. NazÃ¡rka came up
and straightened the head, which was turned to one side so that the round wound
above the temple and the whole of the dead manâs face were visible. âSee what a
mark he has made right in the brain,â he said. âHe wonât get lost. His owners
will always know him!â No one answered, and again the Angel of Silence flew
over the Cossacks.

The sun had risen high and its diverging beams were lighting up the dewy grass.
Near by, the TÃ©rek murmured in the awakened wood and, greeting the morning, the
pheasants called to one another. The Cossacks stood still and silent around the
dead man, gazing at him. The brown body, with nothing on but the wet blue
trousers held by a girdle over the sunken stomach, was well shaped and
handsome. The muscular arms lay stretched straight out by his sides; the blue,
freshly shaven, round head with the clotted wound on one side of it was thrown
back. The smooth tanned forehead contrasted sharply with the shaven part of the
head. The open glassy eyes with lowered pupils stared upwards, seeming to gaze
past everything. Under the red trimmed moustache the fine lips, drawn at the
corners, seemed stiffened into a smile of good-natured subtle raillery. The
fingers of the small hands covered with red hairs were bent inward, and the
nails were dyed red.

LukÃ¡shka had not yet dressed. He was wet. His neck was redder and his eyes
brighter than usual, his broad jaws twitched, and from his healthy body a
hardly perceptible steam rose in the fresh morning air.

âHe too was a man!â he muttered, evidently admiring the corpse.

âYes, if you had fallen into his hands you would have had short shrift,â said
one of the Cossacks.

The Angel of Silence had taken wing. The Cossacks began bustling about and
talking. Two of them went to cut brushwood for a shelter, others strolled
towards the cordon. Luke and NazÃ¡rka ran to get ready to go to the village.

Half an hour later they were both on their way homewards, talking incessantly
and almost running through the dense woods which separated the TÃ©rek from the
village.

âMind, donât tell her I sent you, but just go and find out if her husband is at
home,â Luke was saying in his shrill voice.

âAnd Iâll go round to YÃ¡mka too,â said the devoted NazÃ¡rka. âWeâll have a
spree, shall we?â

âWhen should we have one if not today?â replied Luke.

When they reached the village the two Cossacks drank, and lay down to sleep
till evening.

Chapter X

On the third day after the events above described, two companies of a Caucasian
infantry regiment arrived at the Cossack village of NovomlÃ­nsk. The horses had
been unharnessed and the companiesâ wagons were standing in the square. The
cooks had dug a pit, and with logs gathered from various yards (where they had
not been sufficiently securely stored) were now cooking the food; the
pay-sergeants were settling accounts with the soldiers. The Service Corps men
were driving piles in the ground to which to tie the horses, and the
quartermasters were going about the streets just as if they were at home,
showing officers and men to their quarters. Here were green ammunition boxes in
a line, the companyâs carts, horses, and cauldrons in which buckwheat porridge
was being cooked.

Here were the captain and the lieutenant and the sergeant-major, Onisim
MikhÃ¡ylovich, and all this was in the Cossack village where it was reported
that the companies were ordered to take up their quarters: therefore they were
at home here.

But why they were stationed there, who the Cossacks were, and whether they
wanted the troops to be there, and whether they were Old Believers or notâwas
all quite immaterial. Having received their pay and been dismissed, tired out
and covered with dust, the soldiers noisily and in disorder, like a swarm of
bees about to settle, spread over the squares and streets.

Quite regardless of the Cossacksâ ill will, chattering merrily and with their
muskets clinking, by twos and threes they entered the huts and hung up their
accoutrements, unpacked their bags, and bantered the women. At their favourite
spot, round the porridge-cauldrons, a large group of soldiers assembled and
with little pipes between their teeth they gazed, now at the smoke which rose
into the hot sky, becoming visible when it thickened into white clouds as it
rose, and now at the camp fires which were quivering in the pure air like
molten glass, and bantered and made fun of the Cossack men and women because
they do not live at all like Russians. In all the yards one could see soldiers
and hear their laughter and the exasperated and shrill cries of Cossack women
defending their houses and refusing to give the soldiers water or cooking
utensils. Little boys and girls, clinging to their mothers and to each other,
followed all the movements of the troopers (never before seen by them) with
frightened curiosity, or ran after them at a respectful distance.

The old Cossacks came out silently and dismally and sat on the earthen
embankments of their huts, and watched the soldiersâ activity with an air of
leaving it all to the will of God without understanding what would come of it.

OlÃ©nin, who had joined the Caucasian Army as a cadet three months before, was
quartered in one of the best houses in the village, the house of the cornet,
Elias VasÃ­lichâthat is to say at Granny UlÃ­tkaâs.

âGoodness knows what it will be like, DmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich,â said the panting
VanyÃºsha to OlÃ©nin, who, dressed in a Circassian coat and mounted on a KabardÃ¡
horse which he had bought in GrÃ³znoe, was after a five-hoursâ march gaily
entering the yard of the quarters assigned to him.

âWhy, whatâs the matter?â he asked, caressing his horse and looking merrily at
the perspiring, dishevelled, and worried VanyÃºsha, who had arrived with the
baggage wagons and was unpacking.

OlÃ©nin looked quite a different man. In place of his clean-shaven lips and chin
he had a youthful moustache and a small beard. Instead of a sallow complexion,
the result of nights turned into day, his cheeks, his forehead, and the skin
behind his ears were now red with healthy sunburn. In place of a clean new
black suit he wore a dirty white Circassian coat with a deeply pleated skirt,
and he bore arms. Instead of a freshly starched collar, his neck was tightly
clasped by the red band of his silk
beshmet
. He wore Circassian dress
but did not wear it well, and anyone would have known him for a Russian and not
a Tartar brave. It was the thingâbut not the real thing. But for all that, his
whole person breathed health, joy, and satisfaction.

âYes, it seems funny to you,â said VanyÃºsha, âbut just try to talk to these
people yourself: they set themselves against one and thereâs an end of it. You
canât get as much as a word out of them.â VanyÃºsha angrily threw down a pail on
the threshold. âSomehow they donât seem like Russians.â

âYou should speak to the Chief of the Village!â

âBut I donât know where he lives,â said VanyÃºsha in an offended tone.

âWho has upset you so?â asked OlÃ©nin, looking round.

âThe devil only knows. Faugh! There is no real master here. They say he has
gone to some kind of
kriga
, and the old woman is a real devil. God
preserve us!â answered VanyÃºsha, putting his hands to his head. âHow we shall
live here I donât know. They are worse than Tartars, I do declareâthough they
consider themselves Christians! A Tartar is bad enough, but all the same he is
more noble. Gone to the
kriga
indeed! What this
kriga
they have
invented is, I donât know!â concluded VanyÃºsha, and turned aside.

âItâs not as it is in the serfsâ quarters at home, eh?â chaffed OlÃ©nin without
dismounting.

âPlease sir, may I have your horse?â said VanyÃºsha, evidently perplexed by this
new order of things but resigning himself to his fate.

âSo a Tartar is more noble, eh, VanyÃºsha?â repeated OlÃ©nin, dismounting and
slapping the saddle.

âYes, youâre laughing! You think it funny,â muttered VanyÃºsha angrily.

âCome, donât be angry, VanyÃºsha,â replied OlÃ©nin, still smiling. âWait a
minute, Iâll go and speak to the people of the house; youâll see I shall
arrange everything. You donât know what a jolly life we shall have here. Only
donât get upset.â

VanyÃºsha did not answer. Screwing up his eyes he looked contemptuously after
his master, and shook his head. VanyÃºsha regarded OlÃ©nin as only his master,
and OlÃ©nin regarded VanyÃºsha as only his servant; and they would both have been
much surprised if anyone had told them that they were friends, as they really
were without knowing it themselves. VanyÃºsha had been taken into his
proprietorâs house when he was only eleven and when OlÃ©nin was the same age.
When OlÃ©nin was fifteen he gave VanyÃºsha lessons for a time and taught him to
read French, of which the latter was inordinately proud; and when in specially
good spirits he still let off French words, always laughing stupidly when he
did so.

OlÃ©nin ran up the steps of the porch and pushed open the door of the hut.
MaryÃ¡nka, wearing nothing but a pink smock, as all Cossack women do in the
house, jumped away from the door, frightened, and pressing herself against the
wall covered the lower part of her face with the broad sleeve of her Tartar
smock. Having opened the door wider, OlÃ©nin in the semi-darkness of the passage
saw the whole tall, shapely figure of the young Cossack girl. With the quick
and eager curiosity of youth he involuntarily noticed the firm maidenly form
revealed by the fine print smock, and the beautiful black eyes fixed on him
with childlike terror and wild curiosity.

âThis is
she
,â thought OlÃ©nin. âBut there will be many others like herâ
came at once into his head, and he opened the inner door.

Old Granny UlÃ­tka, also dressed only in a smock, was stooping with her back
turned to him, sweeping the floor.

âGood-day to you. Mother! Iâve come about my lodgings,â he began.

The Cossack woman, without unbending, turned her severe but still handsome face
towards him.

âWhat have you come here for? Want to mock at us, eh? Iâll teach you to mock;
may the black plague seize you!â she shouted, looking askance from under her
frowning brow at the new-comer.

OlÃ©nin had at first imagined that the way-worn, gallant Caucasian Army (of
which he was a member) would be everywhere received joyfully, and especially by
the Cossacks, our comrades in the war; and he therefore felt perplexed by this
reception. Without losing presence of mind however he tried to explain that he
meant to pay for his lodgings, but the old woman would not give him a hearing.

âWhat have you come for? Who wants a pest like you, with your scraped face? You
just wait a bit; when the master returns heâll show you your place. I donât
want your dirty money! A likely thingâjust as if we had never seen any! Youâll
stink the house out with your beastly tobacco and want to put it right with
money! Think weâve never seen a pest! May you be shot in your bowels and your
heart!â shrieked the old woman in a piercing voice, interrupting OlÃ©nin.

âIt seems VanyÃºsha was right!â thought OlÃ©nin. ââA Tartar would be noblerâ,â
and followed by Granny UlÃ­tkaâs abuse he went out of the hut. As he was
leaving, MaryÃ¡nka, still wearing only her pink smock, but with her forehead
covered down to her eyes by a white kerchief, suddenly slipped out from the
passage past him. Pattering rapidly down the steps with her bare feet she ran
from the porch, stopped, and looking round hastily with laughing eyes at the
young man, vanished round the corner of the hut.

Her firm youthful step, the untamed look of the eyes glistening from under the
white kerchief, and the firm stately build of the young beauty, struck OlÃ©nin
even more powerfully than before. âYes, it must be
she
,â he thought, and
troubling his head still less about the lodgings, he kept looking round at
MaryÃ¡nka as he approached VanyÃºsha.

âThere you see, the girl too is quite savage, just like a wild filly!â said
VanyÃºsha, who though still busy with the luggage wagon had now cheered up a
bit. â
La fame!
â he added in a loud triumphant voice and burst out
laughing.

Chapter XI

Towards evening the master of the house returned from his fishing, and having
learnt that the cadet would pay for the lodging, pacified the old woman and
satisfied VanyÃºshaâs demands.

Everything was arranged in the new quarters. Their hosts moved into the winter
hut and let their summer hut to the cadet for three rubles a month. OlÃ©nin had
something to eat and went to sleep. Towards evening he woke up, washed and made
himself tidy, dined, and having lit a cigarette sat down by the window that
looked onto the street. It was cooler. The slanting shadow of the hut with its
ornamental gables fell across the dusty road and even bent upwards at the base
of the wall of the house opposite. The steep reed-thatched roof of that house
shone in the rays of the setting sun. The air grew fresher. Everything was
peaceful in the village. The soldiers had settled down and become quiet. The
herds had not yet been driven home and the people had not returned from their
work.

OlÃ©ninâs lodging was situated almost at the end of the village. At rare
intervals, from somewhere far beyond the TÃ©rek in those parts whence OlÃ©nin had
just come (the ChÃ©chen or the KumÃ½tsk plain), came muffled sounds of firing.
OlÃ©nin was feeling very well contented after three months of bivouac life. His
newly washed face was fresh and his powerful body clean (an unaccustomed
sensation after the campaign) and in all his rested limbs he was conscious of a
feeling of tranquillity and strength. His mind, too, felt fresh and clear. He
thought of the campaign and of past dangers. He remembered that he had faced
them no worse than other men, and that he was accepted as a comrade among
valiant Caucasians. His Moscow recollections were left behind Heaven knows how
far! The old life was wiped out and a quite new life had begun in which there
were as yet no mistakes. Here as a new man among new men he could gain a new
and good reputation. He was conscious of a youthful and unreasoning joy of
life. Looking now out of the window at the boys spinning their tops in the
shadow of the house, now round his neat new lodging, he thought how pleasantly
he would settle down to this new Cossack village life. Now and then he glanced
at the mountains and the blue sky, and an appreciation of the solemn grandeur
of nature mingled with his reminiscences and dreams. His new life had begun,
not as he imagined it would when he left Moscow, but unexpectedly well. âThe
mountains, the mountains, the mountains!â they permeated all his thoughts and
feelings.

âHeâs kissed his dog and licked the jug! ... Daddy ErÃ³shka has kissed his dog!â
suddenly the little Cossacks who had been spinning their tops under the window
shouted, looking towards the side street. âHeâs drunk his bitch, and his
dagger!â shouted the boys, crowding together and stepping backwards.

These shouts were addressed to Daddy ErÃ³shka, who with his gun on his shoulder
and some pheasants hanging at his girdle was returning from his shooting
expedition.

âI have done wrong, lads, I have!â he said, vigorously swinging his arms and
looking up at the windows on both sides of the street. âI have drunk the bitch;
it was wrong,â he repeated, evidently vexed but pretending not to care.

OlÃ©nin was surprised by the boysâ behavior towards the old hunter, but was
still more struck by the expressive, intelligent face and the powerful build of
the man whom they called Daddy ErÃ³shka.

âHere Daddy, here Cossack!â he called. âCome here!â

The old man looked into the window and stopped.

âGood evening, good man,â he said, lifting his little cap off his cropped head.

âGood evening, good man,â replied OlÃ©nin. âWhat is it the youngsters are
shouting at you?â

Daddy ErÃ³shka came up to the window. âWhy, theyâre teasing the old man. No
matter, I like it. Let them joke about their old daddy,â he said with those
firm musical intonations with which old and venerable people speak. âAre you an
army commander?â he added.

âNo, I am a cadet. But where did you kill those pheasants?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âI dispatched these three hens in the forest,â answered the old man, turning
his broad back towards the window to show the hen pheasants which were hanging
with their heads tucked into his belt and staining his coat with blood.
âHavenât you seen any?â he asked. âTake a brace if you like! Here you are,â and
he handed two of the pheasants in at the window. âAre you a sportsman
yourself?â he asked.

âI am. During the campaign I killed four myself.â

âFour? What a lot!â said the old man sarcastically. âAnd are you a drinker? Do
you drink
chikhir?
â

âWhy not? I like a drink.â

âAh, I see you are a trump! We shall be
kunaks
, you and I,â said Daddy
ErÃ³shka.

âStep in,â said OlÃ©nin. âWeâll have a drop of
chikhir
.â

âI might as well,â said the old man, âbut take the pheasants.â The old manâs
face showed that he liked the cadet. He had seen at once that he could get free
drinks from him, and that therefore it would be all right to give him a brace
of pheasants.

Soon Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs figure appeared in the doorway of the hut, and it was only
then that OlÃ©nin became fully conscious of the enormous size and sturdy build
of this man, whose red-brown face with its perfectly white broad beard was all
furrowed by deep lines produced by age and toil. For an old man, the muscles of
his legs, arms, and shoulders were quite exceptionally large and prominent.
There were deep scars on his head under the short-cropped hair. His thick
sinewy neck was covered with deep intersecting folds like a bullâs. His horny
hands were bruised and scratched. He stepped lightly and easily over the
threshold, unslung his gun and placed it in a corner, and casting a rapid
glance round the room noted the value of the goods and chattels deposited in
the hut, and with out-turned toes stepped softly, in his sandals of raw hide,
into the middle of the room. He brought with him a penetrating but not
unpleasant smell of
chikhir
wine, vodka, gunpowder, and congealed blood.

Daddy ErÃ³shka bowed down before the icons, smoothed his beard, and approaching
OlÃ©nin held out his thick brown hand. â
Koshkildy
,â said he; âThat is
Tartar for âGood-dayâââPeace be unto you,â it means in their tongue.â

â
Koshkildy
, I know,â answered OlÃ©nin, shaking hands.

âEh, but you donât, you wonât know the right order! Fool!â said Daddy ErÃ³shka,
shaking his head reproachfully. âIf anyone says â
Koshkildy
â to you, you
must say â
Allah rasi bo sun
,â that is, âGod save you.â Thatâs the way,
my dear fellow, and not â
Koshkildy
.â But Iâll teach you all about it. We
had a fellow here, Elias MÃ³sevich, one of your Russians, he and I were

kunaks
. He was a trump, a drunkard, a thief, a sportsmanâand what a
sportsman! I taught him everything.â

âAnd what will you teach me?â asked OlÃ©nin, who was becoming more and more
interested in the old man.

âIâll take you hunting and teach you to fish. Iâll show you ChÃ©chens and find a
girl for you, if you likeâeven that! Thatâs the sort I am! Iâm a wag!ââand the
old man laughed. âIâll sit down. Iâm tired.
Karga?
â he added
inquiringly.

âAnd what does â
Karga
â mean?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âWhy, that means âAll rightâ in Georgian. But I say it just so. It is a way I
have, itâs my favourite word.
Karga
,
Karga
. I say it just so; in
fun I mean. Well, lad, wonât you order the
chikhir?
Youâve got an
orderly, havenât you?â

âYes.â

âHey, IvÃ¡n!â shouted the old man. âAll your soldiers are IvÃ¡ns. Is yours IvÃ¡n?â

âTrue enough, his name is IvÃ¡nâVanyÃºsha. Here VanyÃºsha! Please get some

chikhir
from our landlady and bring it here.â

âIvÃ¡n or VanyÃºsha, thatâs all one. Why are all your soldiers IvÃ¡ns? IvÃ¡n, old
fellow,â said the old man, âyou tell them to give you some from the barrel they
have begun. They have the best
chikhir
in the village. But donât give
more than thirty kopeks for the quart, mind, because that witch would be only
too glad.... Our people are anathema people; stupid people,â Daddy ErÃ³shka
continued in a confidential tone after VanyÃºsha had gone out. âThey do not look
upon you as on men, you are worse than a Tartar in their eyes. âWorldly
Russiansâ they say. But as for me, though you are a soldier you are still a
man, and have a soul in you. Isnât that right? Elias MÃ³sevich was a soldier,
yet what a treasure of a man he was! Isnât that so, my dear fellow? Thatâs why
our people donât like me; but I donât care! Iâm a merry fellow, and I like
everybody. Iâm ErÃ³shka; yes, my dear fellow.â

And the old Cossack patted the young man affectionately on the shoulder.

Chapter XII

VanyÃºsha, who meanwhile had finished his housekeeping arrangements and had even
been shaved by the companyâs barber and had pulled his trousers out of his high
boots as a sign that the company was stationed in comfortable quarters, was in
excellent spirits. He looked attentively but not benevolently at ErÃ³shka, as at
a wild beast he had never seen before, shook his head at the floor which the
old man had dirtied and, having taken two bottles from under a bench, went to
the landlady.

âGood evening, kind people,â he said, having made up his mind to be very
gentle. âMy master has sent me to get some
chikhir
. Will you draw some
for me, good folk?â

The old woman gave no answer. The girl, who was arranging the kerchief on her
head before a little Tartar mirror, looked round at VanyÃºsha in silence.

âIâll pay money for it, honoured people,â said VanyÃºsha, jingling the coppers
in his pocket. âBe kind to us and we, too will be kind to you,â he added.

âHow much?â asked the old woman abruptly. âA quart.â

âGo, my own, draw some for them,â said Granny UlÃ­tka to her daughter. âTake it
from the cask thatâs begun, my precious.â

The girl took the keys and a decanter and went out of the hut with VanyÃºsha.

âTell me, who is that young woman?â asked OlÃ©nin, pointing to MaryÃ¡nka, who was
passing the window. The old man winked and nudged the young man with his elbow.

âWait a bit,â said he and reached out of the window. âKhm,â he coughed, and
bellowed, âMaryÃ¡nka dear. Hallo, MaryÃ¡nka, my girlie, wonât you love me,
darling? Iâm a wag,â he added in a whisper to OlÃ©nin. The girl, not turning her
head and swinging her arms regularly and vigorously, passed the window with the
peculiarly smart and bold gait of a Cossack woman and only turned her dark
shaded eyes slowly towards the old man.

âLove me and youâll be happy,â shouted ErÃ³shka, winking, and he looked
questioningly at the cadet.

âIâm a fine fellow, Iâm a wag!â he added. âSheâs a regular queen, that girl.
Eh?â

âShe is lovely,â said OlÃ©nin. âCall her here!â

âNo, no,â said the old man. âFor that one a match is being arranged with
LukÃ¡shka, Luke, a fine Cossack, a brave, who killed an
abrek
the other
day. Iâll find you a better one. Iâll find you one that will be all dressed up
in silk and silver. Once Iâve said it Iâll do it. Iâll get you a regular
beauty!â

âYou, an old manâand say such things,â replied OlÃ©nin. âWhy, itâs a sin!â

âA sin? Whereâs the sin?â said the old man emphatically. âA sin to look at a
nice girl? A sin to have some fun with her? Or is it a sin to love her? Is that
so in your parts? ... No, my dear fellow, itâs not a sin, itâs salvation! God
made you and God made the girl too. He made it all; so it is no sin to look at
a nice girl. Thatâs what she was made for; to be loved and to give joy. Thatâs
how I judge it, my good fellow.â

Having crossed the yard and entered a cool dark storeroom filled with barrels,
MaryÃ¡nka went up to one of them and repeating the usual prayer plunged a dipper
into it. VanyÃºsha standing in the doorway smiled as he looked at her. He
thought it very funny that she had only a smock on, close-fitting behind and
tucked up in front, and still funnier that she wore a necklace of silver coins.
He thought this quite un-Russian and that they would all laugh in the serfsâ
quarters at home if they saw a girl like that. â
La fille comme câest tres
bien
, for a change,â he thought. âIâll tell that to my master.â

âWhat are you standing in the light for, you devil!â the girl suddenly shouted.
âWhy donât you pass me the decanter!â

Having filled the decanter with cool red wine, MaryÃ¡nka handed it to VanyÃºsha.

âGive the money to Mother,â she said, pushing away the hand in which he held
the money.

VanyÃºsha laughed.

âWhy are you so cross, little dear?â he said good-naturedly, irresolutely
shuffling with his feet while the girl was covering the barrel.

She began to laugh.

âAnd you! Are you kind?â

âWe, my master and I, are very kind,â VanyÃºsha answered decidedly. âWe are so
kind that wherever we have stayed our hosts were always very grateful. Itâs
because heâs generous.â

The girl stood listening.

âAnd is your master married?â she asked.

âNo. The master is young and unmarried, because noble gentlemen can never marry
young,â said VanyÃºsha didactically.

âA likely thing! See what a fed-up buffalo he isâand too young to marry! Is he
the chief of you all?â she asked.

âMy master is a cadet; that means heâs not yet an officer, but heâs more
important than a generalâheâs an important man! Because not only our colonel,
but the Tsar himself, knows him,â proudly explained VanyÃºsha. âWe are not like
those other beggars in the line regiment, and our papa himself was a Senator.
He had more than a thousand serfs, all his own, and they send us a thousand
rubles at a time. Thatâs why everyone likes us. Another may be a captain but
have no money. Whatâs the use of that?â

âGo away. Iâll lock up,â said the girl, interrupting him.

VanyÃºsha brought OlÃ©nin the wine and announced that â
La fille câest tres
joulie
,â and, laughing stupidly, at once went out.

Chapter XIII

Meanwhile the tattoo had sounded in the village square. The people had returned
from their work. The herd lowed as in clouds of golden dust it crowded at the
village gate. The girls and the women hurried through the streets and yards,
turning in their cattle. The sun had quite hidden itself behind the distant
snowy peaks. One pale bluish shadow spread over land and sky. Above the
darkened gardens stars just discernible were kindling, and the sounds were
gradually hushed in the village. The cattle having been attended to and left
for the night, the women came out and gathered at the corners of the streets
and, cracking sunflower seeds with their teeth, settled down on the earthen
embankments of the houses. Later on MaryÃ¡nka, having finished milking the
buffalo and the other two cows, also joined one of these groups.

The group consisted of several women and girls and one old Cossack man.

They were talking about the
abrek
who had been killed.

The Cossack was narrating and the women questioning him.

âI expect heâll get a handsome reward,â said one of the women.

âOf course. Itâs said that theyâll send him a cross.â

âMÃ³sev did try to wrong him. Took the gun away from him, but the authorities at
KizlyÃ¡r heard of it.â

âA mean creature that MÃ³sev is!â

âThey say LukÃ¡shka has come home,â remarked one of the girls.

âHe and NazÃ¡rka are merry-making at YÃ¡mkaâs.â (YÃ¡mka was an unmarried,
disreputable Cossack woman who kept an illicit pot-house.) âI heard say they
had drunk half a pailful.â

âWhat luck that Snatcher has,â somebody remarked. âA real snatcher. But thereâs
no denying heâs a fine lad, smart enough for anything, a right-minded lad! His
father was just such another. Daddy KiryÃ¡k was: he takes after his father. When
he was killed the whole village howled. Look, there they are,â added the
speaker, pointing to the Cossacks who were coming down the street towards them.

âAnd ErgushÃ³v has managed to come along with them too! The drunkard!â

LukÃ¡shka, NazÃ¡rka, and ErgushÃ³v, having emptied half a pail of vodka, were
coming towards the girls. The faces of all three, but especially that of the
old Cossack, were redder than usual. ErgushÃ³v was reeling and kept laughing and
nudging NazÃ¡rka in the ribs.

âWhy are you not singing?â he shouted to the girls. âSing to our merry-making,
I tell you!â

They were welcomed with the words, âHad a good day? Had a good day?â

âWhy sing? Itâs not a holiday,â said one of the women. âYouâre tight, so you go
and sing.â

ErgushÃ³v roared with laughter and nudged NazÃ¡rka. âYouâd better sing. And Iâll
begin too. Iâm clever, I tell you.â

âAre you asleep, fair ones?â said NazÃ¡rka. âWeâve come from the cordon to drink
your health. Weâve already drunk LukÃ¡shkaâs health.â

LukÃ¡shka, when he reached the group, slowly raised his cap and stopped in front
of the girls. His broad cheekbones and neck were red. He stood and spoke softly
and sedately, but in his tranquillity and sedateness there was more of
animation and strength than in all NazÃ¡rkaâs loquacity and bustle. He reminded
one of a playful colt that with a snort and a flourish of its tail suddenly
stops short and stands as though nailed to the ground with all four feet.
LukÃ¡shka stood quietly in front of the girls, his eyes laughed, and he spoke
but little as he glanced now at his drunken companions and now at the girls.
When MaryÃ¡nka joined the group he raised his cap with a firm deliberate
movement, moved out of her way and then stepped in front of her with one foot a
little forward and with his thumbs in his belt, fingering his dagger. MaryÃ¡nka
answered his greeting with a leisurely bow of her head, settled down on the
earth-bank, and took some seeds out of the bosom of her smock. LukÃ¡shka,
keeping his eyes fixed on MaryÃ¡nka, slowly cracked seeds and spat out the
shells. All were quiet when MaryÃ¡nka joined the group.

âHave you come for long?â asked a woman, breaking the silence.

âTill tomorrow morning,â quietly replied LukÃ¡shka.

âWell, God grant you get something good,â said the Cossack; âIâm glad of it, as
Iâve just been saying.â

âAnd I say so too,â put in the tipsy ErgushÃ³v, laughing. âWhat a lot of
visitors have come,â he added, pointing to a soldier who was passing by. âThe
soldiersâ vodka is goodâI like it.â

âTheyâve sent three of the devils to us,â said one of the women. âGrandad went
to the village Elders, but they say nothing can be done.â

âAh, ha! Have you met with trouble?â said ErgushÃ³v.

âI expect they have smoked you out with their tobacco?â asked another woman.
âSmoke as much as you like in the yard, I say, but we wonât allow it inside the
hut. Not if the Elder himself comes, I wonât allow it. Besides, they may rob
you. Heâs not quartered any of them on himself, no fear, that devilâs son of an
Elder.â

âYou donât like it?â ErgushÃ³v began again.

âAnd Iâve also heard say that the girls will have to make the soldiersâ beds
and offer them
chikhir
and honey,â said NazÃ¡rka, putting one foot
forward and tilting his cap like LukÃ¡shka.

ErgushÃ³v burst into a roar of laughter, and seizing the girl nearest to him, he
embraced her. âI tell you true.â

âNow then, you black pitch!â squealed the girl, âIâll tell your old woman.â

âTell her,â shouted he. âThatâs quite right what NazÃ¡rka says; a circular has
been sent round. He can read, you know. Quite true!â And he began embracing the
next girl.

âWhat are you up to, you beast?â squealed the rosy, round-faced Ãstenka,
laughing and lifting her arm to hit him.

The Cossack stepped aside and nearly fell.

âThere, they say girls have no strength, and you nearly killed me.â

âGet away, you black pitch, what devil has brought you from the cordon?â said
Ãstenka, and turning away from him she again burst out laughing. âYou were
asleep and missed the
abrek
, didnât you? Suppose he had done for you it
would have been all the better.â

âYouâd have howled, I expect,â said NazÃ¡rka, laughing.

âHowled! A likely thing.â

âJust look, she doesnât care. Sheâd howl, NazÃ¡rka, eh? Would she?â said
ErgushÃ³v.

LukÃ¡shka all this time had stood silently looking at MaryÃ¡nka. His gaze
evidently confused the girl.

âWell, MaryÃ¡nka! I hear theyâve quartered one of the chiefs on you?â he said,
drawing nearer.

MaryÃ¡nka, as was her wont, waited before she replied, and slowly raising her
eyes looked at the Cossack. LukÃ¡shkaâs eyes were laughing as if something
special, apart from what was said, was taking place between himself and the
girl.

âYes, itâs all right for them as they have two huts,â replied an old woman on
MaryÃ¡nkaâs behalf, âbut at FÃ³mushkinâs now they also have one of the chiefs
quartered on them and they say one whole corner is packed full with his things,
and the family have no room left. Was such a thing ever heard of as that they
should turn a whole horde loose in the village?â she said. âAnd what the plague
are they going to do here?â

âIâve heard say theyâll build a bridge across the TÃ©rek,â said one of the
girls.

âAnd Iâve been told that they will dig a pit to put the girls in because they
donât love the lads,â said NazÃ¡rka, approaching Ãstenka; and he again made a
whimsical gesture which set everybody laughing, and ErgushÃ³v, passing by
MaryÃ¡nka, who was next in turn, began to embrace an old woman.

âWhy donât you hug MaryÃ¡nka? You should do it to each in turn,â said NazÃ¡rka.

âNo, my old one is sweeter,â shouted the Cossack, kissing the struggling old
woman.

âYouâll throttle me,â she screamed, laughing.

The tramp of regular footsteps at the other end of the street interrupted their
laughter. Three soldiers in their cloaks, with their muskets on their
shoulders, were marching in step to relieve guard by the ammunition wagon.

The corporal, an old cavalry man, looked angrily at the Cossacks and led his
men straight along the road where LukÃ¡shka and NazÃ¡rka were standing, so that
they should have to get out of the way. NazÃ¡rka moved, but LukÃ¡shka only
screwed up his eyes and turned his broad back without moving from his place.

âPeople are standing here, so you go round,â he muttered, half turning his head
and tossing it contemptuously in the direction of the soldiers.

The soldiers passed by in silence, keeping step regularly along the dusty road.

MaryÃ¡nka began laughing and all the other girls chimed in.

âWhat swells!â said NazÃ¡rka, âJust like long-skirted choristers,â and he walked
a few steps down the road imitating the soldiers.

Again everyone broke into peals of laughter.

LukÃ¡shka came slowly up to MaryÃ¡nka.

âAnd where have you put up the chief?â he asked.

MaryÃ¡nka thought for a moment.

âWeâve let him have the new hut,â she said.

âAnd is he old or young,â asked LukÃ¡shka, sitting down beside her.

âDo you think Iâve asked?â answered the girl. âI went to get him some

chikhir
and saw him sitting at the window with Daddy ErÃ³shka. Red-headed
he seemed. Theyâve brought a whole cartload of things.â

And she dropped her eyes.

âOh, how glad I am that I got leave from the cordon!â said LukÃ¡shka, moving
closer to the girl and looking straight in her eyes all the time.

âAnd have you come for long?â asked MaryÃ¡nka, smiling slightly.

âTill the morning. Give me some sunflower seeds,â he said, holding out his
hand.

MaryÃ¡nka now smiled outright and unfastened the neckband of her smock.

âDonât take them all,â she said.

âReally I felt so dull all the time without you, I swear I did,â he said in a
calm, restrained whisper, helping himself to some seeds out of the bosom of the
girlâs smock, and stooping still closer over her he continued with laughing
eyes to talk to her in low tones.

âI wonât come, I tell you,â MaryÃ¡nka suddenly said aloud, leaning away from
him.

âNo really ... what I wanted to say to you, ...â whispered LukÃ¡shka. âBy the
Heavens! Do come!â

MaryÃ¡nka shook her head, but did so with a smile.

âNursey MaryÃ¡nka! Hallo Nursey! Mammy is calling! Supper time!â shouted
MaryÃ¡nkaâs little brother, running towards the group.

âIâm coming,â replied the girl. âGo, my dear, go aloneâIâll come in a minute.â

LukÃ¡shka rose and raised his cap.

âI expect I had better go home too, that will be best,â he said, trying to
appear unconcerned but hardly able to repress a smile, and he disappeared
behind the corner of the house.

Meanwhile night had entirely enveloped the village. Bright stars were scattered
over the dark sky. The streets became dark and empty. NazÃ¡rka remained with the
women on the earth-bank and their laughter was still heard, but LukÃ¡shka,
having slowly moved away from the girls, crouched down like a cat and then
suddenly started running lightly, holding his dagger to steady it: not
homeward, however, but towards the cornetâs house. Having passed two streets he
turned into a lane and lifting the skirt of his coat sat down on the ground in
the shadow of a fence. âA regular cornetâs daughter!â he thought about
MaryÃ¡nka. âWonât even have a larkâthe devil! But just wait a bit.â

The approaching footsteps of a woman attracted his attention. He began
listening, and laughed all by himself. MaryÃ¡nka with bowed head, striking the
pales of the fences with a switch, was walking with rapid regular strides
straight towards him. LukÃ¡shka rose. MaryÃ¡nka started and stopped.

âWhat an accursed devil! You frightened me! So you have not gone home?â she
said, and laughed aloud.

LukÃ¡shka put one arm round her and with the other hand raised her face. âWhat I
wanted to tell you, by Heaven!â his voice trembled and broke.

âWhat are you talking of, at night time!â answered MaryÃ¡nka. âMother is waiting
for me, and youâd better go to your sweetheart.â

And freeing herself from his arms she ran away a few steps. When she had
reached the wattle fence of her home she stopped and turned to the Cossack who
was running beside her and still trying to persuade her to stay a while with
him.

âWell, what do you want to say, midnight-gadabout?â and she again began
laughing.

âDonât laugh at me, MaryÃ¡nka! By the Heaven! Well, what if I have a sweetheart?
May the devil take her! Only say the word and now Iâll love youâIâll do
anything you wish. Here they are!â and he jingled the money in his pocket. âNow
we can live splendidly. Others have pleasures, and I? I get no pleasure from
you, MaryÃ¡nka dear!â

The girl did not answer. She stood before him breaking her switch into little
bits with a rapid movement of her fingers.

LukÃ¡shka suddenly clenched his teeth and fists.

âAnd why keep waiting and waiting? Donât I love you, darling? You can do what
you like with me,â said he suddenly, frowning angrily and seizing both her
hands.

The calm expression of MaryÃ¡nkaâs face and voice did not change.

âDonât bluster, LukÃ¡shka, but listen to me,â she answered, not pulling away her
hands but holding the Cossack at armâs length. âItâs true I am a girl, but you
listen to me! It does not depend on me, but if you love me Iâll tell you this.
Let go my hands, Iâll tell you without.âIâll marry you, but youâll never get
any nonsense from me,â said MaryÃ¡nka without turning her face.

âWhat, youâll marry me? Marriage does not depend on us. Love me yourself,
MaryÃ¡nka dear,â said LukÃ¡shka, from sullen and furious becoming again gentle,
submissive, and tender, and smiling as he looked closely into her eyes.

MaryÃ¡nka clung to him and kissed him firmly on the lips.

âBrother dear!â she whispered, pressing him convulsively to her. Then, suddenly
tearing herself away, she ran into the gate of her house without looking round.

In spite of the Cossackâs entreaties to wait another minute to hear what he had
to say, MaryÃ¡nka did not stop.

âGo,â she cried, âyouâll be seen! I do believe that devil, our lodger, is
walking about the yard.â

âCornetâs daughter,â thought LukÃ¡shka. âShe will marry me. Marriage is all very
well, but you just love me!â

He found NazÃ¡rka at YÃ¡mkaâs house, and after having a spree with him went to
DunÃ¡ykaâs house, where, in spite of her not being faithful to him, he spent the
night.

Chapter XIV

It was quite true that OlÃ©nin had been walking about the yard when MaryÃ¡nka
entered the gate, and had heard her say, âThat devil, our lodger, is walking
about.â He had spent that evening with Daddy ErÃ³shka in the porch of his new
lodging. He had had a table, a samovar, wine, and a candle brought out, and
over a cup of tea and a cigar he listened to the tales the old man told seated
on the threshold at his feet. Though the air was still, the candle dripped and
flickered: now lighting up the post of the porch, now the table and crockery,
now the cropped white head of the old man. Moths circled round the flame and,
shedding the dust of their wings, fluttered on the table and in the glasses,
flew into the candle flame, and disappeared in the black space beyond. OlÃ©nin
and ErÃ³shka had emptied five bottles of
chikhir
. ErÃ³shka filled the
glasses every time, offering one to OlÃ©nin, drinking his health, and talking
untiringly. He told of Cossack life in the old days: of his father, âThe
Broadâ, who alone had carried on his back a boarâs carcass weighing three
hundredweight, and drank two pails of
chikhir
at one sitting. He told of
his own days and his chum GÃ­rchik, with whom during the plague he used to
smuggle felt cloaks across the TÃ©rek. He told how one morning he had killed two
deer, and about his âlittle soulâ who used to run to him at the cordon at
night. He told all this so eloquently and picturesquely that OlÃ©nin did not
notice how time passed. âAh yes, my dear fellow, you did not know me in my
golden days; then Iâd have shown you things. Today itâs âErÃ³shka licks the
jugâ, but then ErÃ³shka was famous in the whole regiment. Whose was the finest
horse? Who had a Gurda sword? To whom should one go to get a drink? With whom
go on the spree? Who should be sent to the mountains to kill Ahmet Khan? Why,
always ErÃ³shka! Whom did the girls love? Always ErÃ³shka had to answer for it.
Because I was a real brave: a drinker, a thief (I used to seize herds of horses
in the mountains), a singer; I was a master of every art! There are no Cossacks
like that nowadays. Itâs disgusting to look at them. When theyâre that high
(ErÃ³shka held his hand three feet from the ground) they put on idiotic boots
and keep looking at themâthatâs all the pleasure they know. Or theyâll drink
themselves foolish, not like men but all wrong. And who was I? I was ErÃ³shka,
the thief; they knew me not only in this village but up in the mountains.
Tartar princes, my
kunaks
, used to come to see me! I used to be
everybodyâs
kunak
. If he was a Tartarâwith a Tartar; an Armenianâwith an
Armenian; a soldierâwith a soldier; an officerâwith an officer! I didnât care
as long as he was a drinker. He says you should cleanse yourself from
intercourse with the world, not drink with soldiers, not eat with a Tartar.â

âWho says all that?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âWhy, our teacher! But listen to a Mullah or a Tartar Cadi. He says, âYou
unbelieving Giaours, why do you eat pig?â That shows that everyone has his own
law. But I think itâs all one. God has made everything for the joy of man.
There is no sin in any of it. Take example from an animal. It lives in the
Tartarâs reeds or in ours. Wherever it happens to go, there is its home!
Whatever God gives it, that it eats! But our people say we have to lick red-hot
plates in hell for that. And I think itâs all a fraud,â he added after a pause.

âWhat is a fraud?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âWhy, what the preachers say. We had an army captain in ChervlÃ«na who was my

kunak:
a fine fellow just like me. He was killed in ChÃ©chnya. Well, he used to
say that the preachers invent all that out of their own heads. âWhen you die
the grass will grow on your grave and thatâs all!ââ The old man laughed. âHe
was a desperate fellow.â

âAnd how old are you?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âThe Lord only knows! I must be about seventy. When a Tsaritsa reigned in
Russia I was no longer very small. So you can reckon it out. I must be
seventy.â

âYes you must, but you are still a fine fellow.â

âWell, thank Heaven I am healthy, quite healthy, except that a woman, a witch,
has harmed me....â

âHow?â

âOh, just harmed me.â

âAnd so when you die the grass will grow?â repeated OlÃ©nin.

ErÃ³shka evidently did not wish to express his thought clearly. He was silent
for a while.

âAnd what did you think? Drink!â he shouted suddenly, smiling and handing
OlÃ©nin some wine.

Chapter XV

âWell, what was I saying?â he continued, trying to remember. âYes, thatâs the
sort of man I am. I am a hunter. There is no hunter to equal me in the whole
army. I will find and show you any animal and any bird, and what and where. I
know it all! I have dogs, and two guns, and nets, and a screen and a hawk. I
have everything, thank the Lord! If you are not bragging but are a real
sportsman, Iâll show you everything. Do you know what a man I am? When I have
found a trackâI know the animal. I know where he will lie down and where heâll
drink or wallow. I make myself a perch and sit there all night watching. Whatâs
the good of staying at home? One only gets into mischief, gets drunk. And here
women come and chatter, and boys shout at meâenough to drive one mad

âItâs a different matter when you go out at nightfall, choose yourself a place,
press down the reeds and sit there and stay waiting, like a jolly fellow. One
knows everything that goes on in the woods. One looks up at the sky: the stars
move, you look at them and find out from them how the time goes. One looks
roundâthe wood is rustling; one goes on waiting, now there comes a cracklingâa
boar comes to rub himself; one listens to hear the young eaglets screech and
then the cocks give voice in the village, or the geese. When you hear the geese
you know it is not yet midnight. And I know all about it! Or when a gun is
fired somewhere far away, thoughts come to me. One thinks, who is that firing?
Is it another Cossack like myself who has been watching for some animal? And
has he killed it? Or only wounded it so that now the poor thing goes through
the reeds smearing them with its blood all for nothing? I donât like that! Oh,
how I dislike it! Why injure a beast? You fool, you fool! Or one thinks, âMaybe
an
abrek
has killed some silly little Cossack.â All this passes through
oneâs mind. And once as I sat watching by the river I saw a cradle floating
down. It was sound except for one corner which was broken off. Thoughts did
come that time! I thought some of your soldiers, the devils, must have got into
a Tartar village and seized the ChÃ©chen women, and one of the devils has killed
the little one: taken it by its legs, and hit its head against a wall. Donât
they do such things? Sh! Men have no souls! And thoughts came to me that filled
me with pity. I thought: theyâve thrown away the cradle and driven the wife
out, and her brave has taken his gun and come across to our side to rob us. One
watches and thinks. And when one hears a litter breaking through the thicket,
something begins to knock inside one. Dear one, come this way! âTheyâll scent
me,â one thinks; and one sits and does not stir while oneâs heart goes dun!
dun! dun! and simply lifts you. Once this spring a fine litter came near me, I
saw something black. âIn the name of the Father and of the Son,â and I was just
about to fire when she grunts to her pigs: âDanger, children,â she says,
âthereâs a man here,â and off they all ran, breaking through the bushes. And
she had been so close I could almost have bitten her.â

âHow could a sow tell her brood that a man was there?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âWhat do you think? You think the beastâs a fool? No, he is wiser than a man
though you do call him a pig! He knows everything. Take this for instance. A
man will pass along your track and not notice it; but a pig as soon as it gets
onto your track turns and runs at once: that shows there is wisdom in him,
since he scents your smell and you donât. And there is this to be said too: you
wish to kill it and it wishes to go about the woods alive. You have one law and
it has another. It is a pig, but it is no worse than youâit too is Godâs
creature. Ah, dear! Man is foolish, foolish, foolish!â The old man repeated
this several times and then, letting his head drop, he sat thinking.

OlÃ©nin also became thoughtful, and descending from the porch with his hands
behind his back began pacing up and down the yard.

ErÃ³shka, rousing himself, raised his head and began gazing intently at the
moths circling round the flickering flame of the candle and burning themselves
in it.

âFool, fool!â he said. âWhere are you flying to? Fool, fool!â He rose and with
his thick fingers began to drive away the moths.

âYouâll burn, little fool! Fly this way, thereâs plenty of room.â He spoke
tenderly, trying to catch them delicately by their wings with his thick fingers
and then letting them fly again. âYou are killing yourself and I am sorry for
you!â

He sat a long time chattering and sipping out of the bottle. OlÃ©nin paced up
and down the yard. Suddenly he was struck by the sound of whispering outside
the gate. Involuntarily holding his breath, he heard a womanâs laughter, a
manâs voice, and the sound of a kiss. Intentionally rustling the grass under
his feet he crossed to the opposite side of the yard, but after a while the
wattle fence creaked. A Cossack in a dark Circassian coat and a white sheepskin
cap passed along the other side of the fence (it was Luke), and a tall woman
with a white kerchief on her head went past OlÃ©nin. âYou and I have nothing to
do with one anotherâ was what MaryÃ¡nkaâs firm step gave him to understand. He
followed her with his eyes to the porch of the hut, and he even saw her through
the window take off her kerchief and sit down. And suddenly a feeling of lonely
depression and some vague longings and hopes, and envy of someone or other,
overcame the young manâs soul.

The last lights had been put out in the huts. The last sounds had died away in
the village. The wattle fences and the cattle gleaming white in the yards, the
roofs of the houses and the stately poplars, all seemed to be sleeping the
labourersâ healthy peaceful sleep. Only the incessant ringing voices of frogs
from the damp distance reached the young man. In the east the stars were
growing fewer and fewer and seemed to be melting in the increasing light, but
overhead they were denser and deeper than before. The old man was dozing with
his head on his hand. A cock crowed in the yard opposite, but OlÃ©nin still
paced up and down thinking of something. The sound of a song sung by several
voices reached him and he stepped up to the fence and listened. The voices of
several young Cossacks carolled a merry song, and one voice was distinguishable
among them all by its firm strength.

âDo you know who is singing there?â said the old man, rousing himself. âIt is
the Brave, LukÃ¡shka. He has killed a ChÃ©chen and now he rejoices. And what is
there to rejoice at? ... The fool, the fool!â

âAnd have you ever killed people?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âYou devil!â shouted the old man. âWhat are you asking? One must not talk so.
It is a serious thing to destroy a human being ... Ah, a very serious thing!
Good-bye, my dear fellow. Iâve eaten my fill and am drunk,â he said rising.
âShall I come tomorrow to go shooting?â

âYes, come!â

âMind, get up early; if you oversleep you will be fined!â

âNever fear, Iâll be up before you,â answered OlÃ©nin.

The old man left. The song ceased, but one could hear footsteps and merry talk.
A little later the singing broke out again but farther away, and ErÃ³shkaâs loud
voice chimed in with the other. âWhat people, what a life!â thought OlÃ©nin with
a sigh as he returned alone to his hut.

Chapter XVI

Daddy ErÃ³shka was a superannuated and solitary Cossack: twenty years ago his
wife had gone over to the Orthodox Church and run away from him and married a
Russian sergeant-major, and he had no children. He was not bragging when he
spoke of himself as having been the boldest dare-devil in the village when he
was young. Everybody in the regiment knew of his old-time prowess. The death of
more than one Russian, as well as ChÃ©chen, lay on his conscience. He used to go
plundering in the mountains, and robbed the Russians too; and he had twice been
in prison. The greater part of his life was spent in the forests, hunting.
There he lived for days on a crust of bread and drank nothing but water. But on
the other hand, when he was in the village he made merry from morning to night.
After leaving OlÃ©nin he slept for a couple of hours and awoke before it was
light. He lay on his bed thinking of the man he had become acquainted with the
evening before. OlÃ©ninâs âsimplicityâ (simplicity in the sense of not grudging
him a drink) pleased him very much, and so did OlÃ©nin himself. He wondered why
the Russians were all âsimpleâ and so rich, and why they were educated, and yet
knew nothing. He pondered on these questions and also considered what he might
get out of OlÃ©nin.

Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs hut was of a good size and not old, but the absence of a woman
was very noticeable in it. Contrary to the usual cleanliness of the Cossacks,
the whole of this hut was filthy and exceedingly untidy. A blood-stained coat
had been thrown on the table, half a dough-cake lay beside a plucked and
mangled crow with which to feed the hawk. Sandals of raw hide, a gun, a dagger,
a little bag, wet clothes, and sundry rags lay scattered on the benches. In a
corner stood a tub with stinking water, in which another pair of sandals were
being steeped, and near by was a gun and a hunting-screen. On the floor a net
had been thrown down and several dead pheasants lay there, while a hen tied by
its leg was walking about near the table pecking among the dirt. In the
unheated oven stood a broken pot with some kind of milky liquid. On the top of
the oven a falcon was screeching and trying to break the cord by which it was
tied, and a moulting hawk sat quietly on the edge of the oven, looking askance
at the hen and occasionally bowing its head to right and left. Daddy ErÃ³shka
himself, in his shirt, lay on his back on a short bed rigged up between the
wall and the oven, with his strong legs raised and his feet on the oven. He was
picking with his thick fingers at the scratches left on his hands by the hawk,
which he was accustomed to carry without wearing gloves. The whole room,
especially near the old man, was filled with that strong but not unpleasant
mixture of smells that he always carried about with him.

â
Uyde-ma
, Daddy?â (Is Daddy in?) came through the window in a sharp
voice, which he at once recognized as LukÃ¡shkaâs.

â
Uyde, Uyde, Uyde
. I am in!â shouted the old man. âCome in, neighbour
Mark, Luke Mark. Come to see Daddy? On your way to the cordon?â

At the sound of his masterâs shout the hawk flapped his wings and pulled at his
cord.

The old man was fond of LukÃ¡shka, who was the only man he excepted from his
general contempt for the younger generation of Cossacks. Besides that, LukÃ¡shka
and his mother, as near neighbours, often gave the old man wine, clotted cream,
and other home produce which ErÃ³shka did not possess. Daddy ErÃ³shka, who all
his life had allowed himself to get carried away, always explained his
infatuations from a practical point of view. âWell, why not?â he used to say to
himself. âIâll give them some fresh meat, or a bird, and they wonât forget
Daddy: theyâll sometimes bring a cake or a piece of pie.â

âGood morning, Mark! I am glad to see you,â shouted the old man cheerfully, and
quickly putting down his bare feet he jumped off his bed and walked a step or
two along the creaking floor, looked down at his out-turned toes, and suddenly,
amused by the appearance of his feet, smiled, stamped with his bare heel on the
ground, stamped again, and then performed a funny dance-step. âThatâs clever,
eh?â he asked, his small eyes glistening. LukÃ¡shka smiled faintly. âGoing back
to the cordon?â asked the old man.

âI have brought the
chikhir
I promised you when we were at the cordon.â

âMay Christ save you!â said the old man, and he took up the extremely wide
trousers that were lying on the floor, and his
beshmet
, put them on,
fastened a strap round his waist, poured some water from an earthenware pot
over his hands, wiped them on the old trousers, smoothed his beard with a bit
of comb, and stopped in front of LukÃ¡shka. âReady,â he said.

LukÃ¡shka fetched a cup, wiped it and filled it with wine, and then handed it to
the old man.

âYour health! To the Father and the Son!â said the old man, accepting the wine
with solemnity. âMay you have what you desire, may you always be a hero, and
obtain a cross.â

LukÃ¡shka also drank a little after repeating a prayer, and then put the wine on
the table. The old man rose and brought out some dried fish which he laid on
the threshold, where he beat it with a stick to make it tender; then, having
put it with his horny hands on a blue plate (his only one), he placed it on the
table.

âI have all I want. I have victuals, thank God!â he said proudly. âWell, and
what of MÃ³sev?â he added.

LukÃ¡shka, evidently wishing to know the old manâs opinion, told him how the
officer had taken the gun from him.

âNever mind the gun,â said the old man. âIf you donât give the gun you will get
no reward.â

âBut they say, Daddy, itâs little reward a fellow gets when he is not yet a
mounted Cossack; and the gun is a fine one, a Crimean, worth eighty rubles.â

âEh, let it go! I had a dispute like that with an officer, he wanted my horse.
âGive it me and youâll be made a cornet,â says he. I wouldnât, and I got
nothing!â

âYes, Daddy, but you see I have to buy a horse; and they say you canât get one
the other side of the river under fifty rubles, and mother has not yet sold our
wine.â

âEh, we didnât bother,â said the old man; âwhen Daddy ErÃ³shka was your age he
already stole herds of horses from the NogÃ¡y folk and drove them across the
TÃ©rek. Sometimes weâd give a fine horse for a quart of vodka or a cloak.â

âWhy so cheap?â asked LukÃ¡shka.

âYouâre a fool, a fool, Mark,â said the old man contemptuously. âWhy, thatâs
what one steals for, so as not to be stingy! As for you, I suppose you havenât
so much as seen how one drives off a herd of horses? Why donât you speak?â

âWhatâs one to say, Daddy?â replied LukÃ¡shka. âIt seems we are not the same
sort of men as you were.â

âYouâre a fool, Mark, a fool! âNot the same sort of men!ââ retorted the old
man, mimicking the Cossack lad. âI was not that sort of Cossack at your age.â

âHowâs that?â asked LukÃ¡shka.

The old man shook his head contemptuously.

âDaddy ErÃ³shka was
simple;
he did not grudge anything! Thatâs why I was

kunak
with all ChÃ©chnya. A
kunak
would come to visit me and Iâd
make him drunk with vodka and make him happy and put him to sleep with me, and
when I went to see him Iâd take him a presentâa dagger! Thatâs the way it is
done, and not as you do nowadays: the only amusement lads have now is to crack
seeds and spit out the shells!â the old man finished contemptuously, imitating
the present-day Cossacks cracking seeds and spitting out the shells.

âYes, I know,â said LukÃ¡shka; âthatâs so!â

âIf you wish to be a fellow of the right sort, be a brave and not a peasant!
Because even a peasant can buy a horseâpay the money and take the horse.â

They were silent for a while.

âWell, of course itâs dull both in the village and the cordon, Daddy: but
thereâs nowhere one can go for a bit of sport. All our fellows are so timid.
Take NazÃ¡rka. The other day when we went to the Tartar village, GirÃ©y Khan
asked us to come to NogÃ¡y to take some horses, but no one went, and how was I
to go alone?â

âAnd what of Daddy? Do you think I am quite dried up? ... No, Iâm not dried up.
Let me have a horse and Iâll be off to NogÃ¡y at once.â

âWhatâs the good of talking nonsense!â said Luke. âYouâd better tell me what to
do about GirÃ©y Khan. He says, âOnly bring horses to the TÃ©rek, and then even if
you bring a whole stud Iâll find a place for them.â You see heâs also a
shaven-headed Tartarâhowâs one to believe him?â

âYou may trust GirÃ©y Khan, all his kin were good people. His father too was a
faithful
kunak
. But listen to Daddy and I wonât teach you wrong: make
him take an oath, then it will be all right. And if you go with him, have your
pistol ready all the same, especially when it comes to dividing up the horses.
I was nearly killed that way once by a ChÃ©chen. I wanted ten rubles from him
for a horse. Trusting is all right, but donât go to sleep without a gun.â
LukÃ¡shka listened attentively to the old man.

âI say, Daddy, have you any stone-break grass?â he asked after a pause.

âNo, I havenât any, but Iâll teach you how to get it. Youâre a good lad and
wonât forget the old man.... Shall I tell you?â

âTell me, Daddy.â

âYou know a tortoise? Sheâs a devil, the tortoise is!â

âOf course I know!â

âFind her nest and fence it round so that she canât get in. Well, sheâll come,
go round it, and then will go off to find the stone-break grass and will bring
some along and destroy the fence. Anyhow next morning come in good time, and
where the fence is broken there youâll find the stone-break grass lying. Take
it wherever you like. No lock and no bar will be able to stop you.â

âHave you tried it yourself, Daddy?â

âAs for trying, I have not tried it, but I was told of it by good people. I
used only one charm: that was to repeat the Pilgrim rhyme when mounting my
horse; and no one ever killed me!â

âWhat is the Pilgrim rhyme, Daddy?â

âWhat, donât you know it? Oh, what people! Youâre right to ask Daddy. Well,
listen, and repeat after me:

âHail! Ye, living in Sion,

This is your King,

Our steeds we shall sit on,

Sophonius is weeping.

Zacharias is speaking,

Father Pilgrim,

Mankind ever loving.â

âKind ever loving,â the old man repeated. âDo you know it now? Try it.â

LukÃ¡shka laughed.

âCome, Daddy, was it that that hindered their killing you? Maybe it just
happened so!â

âYouâve grown too clever! You learn it all, and say it. It will do you no harm.
Well, suppose you have sung âPilgrimâ, itâs all right,â and the old man himself
began laughing. âBut just one thing, Luke, donât you go to NogÃ¡y!â

âWhy?â

âTimes have changed. You are not the same men. Youâve become rubbishy Cossacks!
And see how many Russians have come down on us! Youâd get to prison. Really,
give it up! Just as if you could! Now GÃ­rchik and I, we used...â

And the old man was about to begin one of his endless tales, but LukÃ¡shka
glanced at the window and interrupted him.

âIt is quite light. Daddy. Itâs time to be off. Look us up some day.â

âMay Christ save you! Iâll go to the officer; I promised to take him out
shooting. He seems a good fellow.â

Chapter XVII

From ErÃ³shkaâs hut LukÃ¡shka went home. As he returned, the dewy mists were
rising from the ground and enveloped the village. In various places the cattle,
though out of sight, could be heard beginning to stir. The cocks called to one
another with increasing frequency and insistence. The air was becoming more
transparent, and the villagers were getting up. Not till he was close to it
could LukÃ¡shka discern the fence of his yard, all wet with dew, the porch of
the hut, and the open shed. From the misty yard he heard the sound of an axe
chopping wood. LukÃ¡shka entered the hut. His mother was up, and stood at the
oven throwing wood into it. His little sister was still lying in bed asleep.

âWell, LukÃ¡shka, had enough holiday-making?â asked his mother softly. âWhere
did you spend the night?â

âI was in the village,â replied her son reluctantly, reaching for his musket,
which he drew from its cover and examined carefully.

His mother swayed her head.

LukÃ¡shka poured a little gunpowder onto the pan, took out a little bag from
which he drew some empty cartridge cases which he began filling, carefully
plugging each one with a ball wrapped in a rag. Then, having tested the loaded
cartridges with his teeth and examined them, he put down the bag.

âI say, Mother, I told you the bags wanted mending; have they been done?â he
asked.

âOh yes, our dumb girl was mending something last night. Why, is it time for
you to be going back to the cordon? I havenât seen anything of you!â

âYes, as soon as I have got ready I shall have to go,â answered LukÃ¡shka, tying
up the gunpowder. âAnd where is our dumb one? Outside?â

âChopping wood, I expect. She kept fretting for you. âI shall not see him at
all!â she said. She puts her hand to her face like this, and clicks her tongue
and presses her hands to her heart as much as to sayââsorry.â Shall I call her
in? She understood all about the
abrek
.â

âCall her,â said LukÃ¡shka. âAnd I had some tallow there; bring it: I must
grease my sword.â

The old woman went out, and a few minutes later LukÃ¡shkaâs dumb sister came up
the creaking steps and entered the hut. She was six years older than her
brother and would have been extremely like him had it not been for the dull and
coarsely changeable expression (common to all deaf and dumb people) of her
face. She wore a coarse smock all patched; her feet were bare and muddy, and on
her head she had an old blue kerchief. Her neck, arms, and face were sinewy
like a peasantâs. Her clothing and her whole appearance indicated that she
always did the hard work of a man. She brought in a heap of logs which she
threw down by the oven. Then she went up to her brother, and with a joyful
smile which made her whole face pucker up, touched him on the shoulder and
began making rapid signs to him with her hands, her face, and whole body.

âThatâs right, thatâs right, StÃ«pka is a trump!â answered the brother, nodding.
âSheâs fetched everything and mended everything, sheâs a trump! Here, take this
for it!â He brought out two pieces of gingerbread from his pocket and gave them
to her.

The dumb womanâs face flushed with pleasure, and she began making a weird noise
for joy. Having seized the gingerbread she began to gesticulate still more
rapidly, frequently pointing in one direction and passing her thick finger over
her eyebrows and her face. LukÃ¡shka understood her and kept nodding, while he
smiled slightly. She was telling him to give the girls dainties, and that the
girls liked him, and that one girl, MaryÃ¡nkaâthe best of them allâloved him.
She indicated MaryÃ¡nka by rapidly pointing in the direction of MaryÃ¡nkaâs home
and to her own eyebrows and face, and by smacking her lips and swaying her
head. âLovesâ she expressed by pressing her hands to her breast, kissing her
hand, and pretending to embrace someone. Their mother returned to the hut, and
seeing what her dumb daughter was saying, smiled and shook her head. Her
daughter showed her the gingerbread and again made the noise which expressed
joy.

âI told UlÃ­tka the other day that Iâd send a matchmaker to them,â said the
mother. âShe took my words well.â

LukÃ¡shka looked silently at his mother.

âBut how about selling the wine, mother? I need a horse.â

âIâll cart it when I have time. I must get the barrels ready,â said the mother,
evidently not wishing her son to meddle in domestic matters. âWhen you go out
youâll find a bag in the passage. I borrowed from the neighbours and got
something for you to take back to the cordon; or shall I put it in your
saddle-bag?â

âAll right,â answered LukÃ¡shka. âAnd if GirÃ©y Khan should come across the river
send him to me at the cordon, for I shanât get leave again for a long time now;
I have some business with him.â

He began to get ready to start.

âI will send him on,â said the old woman. âIt seems you have been spreeing at
YÃ¡mkaâs all the time. I went out in the night to see the cattle, and I think it
was your voice I heard singing songs.â

LukÃ¡shka did not reply, but went out into the passage, threw the bags over his
shoulder, tucked up the skirts of his coat, took his musket, and then stopped
for a moment on the threshold.

âGood-bye, mother!â he said as he closed the gate behind him. âSend me a small
barrel with NazÃ¡rka. I promised it to the lads, and heâll call for it.â

âMay Christ keep you, LukÃ¡shka. God be with you! Iâll send you some, some from
the new barrel,â said the old woman, going to the fence: âBut listen,â she
added, leaning over the fence.

The Cossack stopped.

âYouâve been making merry here; well, thatâs all right. Why should not a young
man amuse himself? God has sent you luck and thatâs good. But now look out and
mind, my son. Donât you go and get into mischief. Above all, satisfy your
superiors: one has to! And I will sell the wine and find money for a horse and
will arrange a match with the girl for you.â

âAll right, all right!â answered her son, frowning.

His deaf sister shouted to attract his attention. She pointed to her head and
the palm of her hand, to indicate the shaved head of a ChÃ©chen. Then she
frowned, and pretending to aim with a gun, she shrieked and began rapidly
humming and shaking her head. This meant that LukÃ¡shka should kill another
ChÃ©chen.

LukÃ¡shka understood. He smiled, and shifting the gun at his back under his
cloak stepped lightly and rapidly, and soon disappeared in the thick mist.

The old woman, having stood a little while at the gate, returned silently to
the hut and immediately began working.

Chapter XVIII

Lukasha returned to the cordon and at the same time Daddy ErÃ³shka whistled to
his dogs and, climbing over his wattle fence, went to OlÃ©ninâs lodging, passing
by the back of the houses (he disliked meeting women before going out hunting
or shooting). He found OlÃ©nin still asleep, and even VanyÃºsha, though awake,
was still in bed and looking round the room considering whether it was not time
to get up, when Daddy ErÃ³shka, gun on shoulder and in full hunterâs trappings,
opened the door.

âA cudgel!â he shouted in his deep voice. âAn alarm! The ChÃ©chens are upon us!
IvÃ¡n! Get the samovar ready for your master, and get up yourselfâquick,â cried
the old man. âThatâs our way, my good man! Why even the girls are already up!
Look out of the window. See, sheâs going for water and youâre still sleeping!â

OlÃ©nin awoke and jumped up, feeling fresh and lighthearted at the sight of the
old man and at the sound of his voice.

âQuick, VanyÃºsha, quick!â he cried.

âIs that the way you go hunting?â said the old man. âOthers are having their
breakfast and you are asleep! Lyam! Here!â he called to his dog. âIs your gun
ready?â he shouted, as loud as if a whole crowd were in the hut.

âWell, itâs true Iâm guilty, but it canât be helped! The powder, VanyÃºsha, and
the wads!â said OlÃ©nin.

âA fine!â shouted the old man.

â
Du tay voulay vou?
â asked VanyÃºsha, grinning.

âYouâre not one of usâyour gabble is not like our speech, you devil!â the old
man shouted at VanyÃºsha, showing the stumps of his teeth.

âA first offence must be forgiven,â said OlÃ©nin playfully, drawing on his high
boots.

âThe first offence shall be forgiven,â answered ErÃ³shka, âbut if you oversleep
another time youâll be fined a pail of
chikhir
. When it gets warmer you
wonât find the deer.â

âAnd even if we do find him he is wiser than we are,â said OlÃ©nin, repeating
the words spoken by the old man the evening before, âand you canât deceive
him!â

âYes, laugh away! You kill one first, and then you may talk. Now then, hurry
up! Look, thereâs the master himself coming to see you,â added ErÃ³shka, looking
out of the window. âJust see how heâs got himself up. Heâs put on a new coat so
that you should see that heâs an officer. Ah, these people, these people!â

Sure enough VanyÃºsha came in and announced that the master of the house wished
to see OlÃ©nin.

â
Lâarjan!
â he remarked profoundly, to forewarn his master of the meaning
of this visitation. Following him, the master of the house in a new Circassian
coat with an officerâs stripes on the shoulders and with polished boots (quite
exceptional among Cossacks) entered the room, swaying from side to side, and
congratulated his lodger on his safe arrival.

The cornet, Elias VasÃ­lich, was an
educated
Cossack. He had been to
Russia proper, was a regimental schoolteacher, and above all he was noble. He
wished to appear noble, but one could not help feeling beneath his grotesque
pretence of polish, his affectation, his self-confidence, and his absurd way of
speaking, he was just the same as Daddy ErÃ³shka. This could also be clearly
seen by his sunburnt face and his hands and his red nose. OlÃ©nin asked him to
sit down.

âGood morning, Father Elias VasÃ­lich,â said ErÃ³shka, rising with (or so it
seemed to OlÃ©nin) an ironically low bow.

âGood morning. Daddy. So youâre here already,â said the cornet, with a careless
nod.

The cornet was a man of about forty, with a grey pointed beard, skinny and
lean, but handsome and very fresh-looking for his age. Having come to see
OlÃ©nin he was evidently afraid of being taken for an ordinary Cossack, and
wanted to let OlÃ©nin feel his importance from the first.

âThatâs our Egyptian Nimrod,â he remarked, addressing OlÃ©nin and pointing to
the old man with a self-satisfied smile. âA mighty hunter before the Lord! Heâs
our foremost man on every hand. Youâve already been pleased to get acquainted
with him.â

Daddy ErÃ³shka gazed at his feet in their shoes of wet raw hide and shook his
head thoughtfully at the cornetâs ability and learning, and muttered to
himself: âGyptian Nimvrod! What things he invents!â

âYes, you see we mean to go hunting,â answered OlÃ©nin.

âYes, sir, exactly,â said the cornet, âbut I have a small business with you.â

âWhat do you want?â

âSeeing that you are a gentleman,â began the cornet, âand as I may understand
myself to be in the rank of an officer too, and therefore we may always
progressively negotiate, as gentlemen do.â (He stopped and looked with a smile
at OlÃ©nin and at the old man.) âBut if you have the desire with my consent,
then, as my wife is a foolish woman of our class, she could not quite
comprehend your words of yesterdayâs date. Therefore my quarters might be let
for six rubles to the Regimental Adjutant, without the stables; but I can
always avert that from myself free of charge. But, as you desire, therefore I,
being myself of an officerâs rank, can come to an agreement with you in
everything personally, as an inhabitant of this district, not according to our
customs, but can maintain the conditions in every way....â

âSpeaks clearly!â muttered the old man.

The cornet continued in the same strain for a long time. At last, not without
difficulty, OlÃ©nin gathered that the cornet wished to let his rooms to him,
OlÃ©nin, for six rubles a month. The latter gladly agreed to this, and offered
his visitor a glass of tea. The cornet declined it.

âAccording to our silly custom we consider it a sort of sin to drink out of a
âworldlyâ tumbler,â he said. âThough, of course, with my education I may
understand, but my wife from her human weakness...â

âWell then, will you have some tea?â

âIf you will permit me, I will bring my own particular glass,â answered the
cornet, and stepped out into the porch.

âBring me my glass!â he cried.

In a few minutes the door opened and a young sunburnt arm in a print sleeve
thrust itself in, holding a tumbler in the hand. The cornet went up, took it,
and whispered something to his daughter. OlÃ©nin poured tea for the cornet into
the latterâs own âparticularâ glass, and for ErÃ³shka into a âworldlyâ glass.

âHowever, I do not desire to detain you,â said the cornet, scalding his lips
and emptying his tumbler. âI too have a great liking for fishing, and I am
here, so to say, only on leave of absence for recreation from my duties. I too
have the desire to tempt fortune and see whether some

may not fall to my share. I hope you too will come and see us and have a drink
of our wine, according to the custom of our village,â he added.

The cornet bowed, shook hands with OlÃ©nin, and went out. While OlÃ©nin was
getting ready, he heard the cornet giving orders to his family in an
authoritative and sensible tone, and a few minutes later he saw him pass by the
window in a tattered coat with his trousers rolled up to his knees and a
fishing net over his shoulder.

âA rascal!â said Daddy ErÃ³shka, emptying his âworldlyâ tumbler. âAnd will you
really pay him six rubles? Was such a thing ever heard of? They would let you
the best hut in the village for two rubles. What a beast! Why, Iâd let you have
mine for three!â

âNo, Iâll remain here,â said OlÃ©nin.

âSix rubles!... Clearly itâs a foolâs money. Eh, eh, eh!â answered the old man.
âLetâs have some
chikhir
, IvÃ¡n!â

Having had a snack and a drink of vodka to prepare themselves for the road,
OlÃ©nin and the old man went out together before eight oâclock.

At the gate they came up against a wagon to which a pair of oxen were
harnessed. With a white kerchief tied round her head down to her eyes, a coat
over her smock, and wearing high boots, MaryÃ¡nka with a long switch in her hand
was dragging the oxen by a cord tied to their horns.

âMammy,â said the old man, pretending that he was going to seize her.

MaryÃ¡nka flourished her switch at him and glanced merrily at them both with her
beautiful eyes.

OlÃ©nin felt still more light-hearted.

âNow then, come on, come on,â he said, throwing his gun on his shoulder and
conscious of the girlâs eyes upon him.

âGee up!â sounded MaryÃ¡nkaâs voice behind them, followed by the creak of the
moving wagon.

As long as their road lay through the pastures at the back of the village
ErÃ³shka went on talking. He could not forget the cornet and kept on abusing
him.

âWhy are you so angry with him?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âHeâs stingy. I donât like it,â answered the old man. âHeâll leave it all
behind when he dies! Then whoâs he saving up for? Heâs built two houses, and
heâs got a second garden from his brother by a law-suit. And in the matter of
papers what a dog he is! They come to him from other villages to fill up
documents. As he writes it out, exactly so it happens. He gets it quite exact.
But who is he saving for? Heâs only got one boy and the girl; when sheâs
married whoâll be left?â

âWell then, heâs saving up for her dowry,â said OlÃ©nin.

âWhat dowry? The girl is sought after, sheâs a fine girl. But heâs such a devil
that he must yet marry her to a rich fellow. He wants to get a big price for
her. Thereâs Luke, a Cossack, a neighbour and a nephew of mine, a fine lad.
Itâs he who killed the ChÃ©chenâhe has been wooing her for a long time, but he
hasnât let him have her. Heâs given one excuse, and another, and a third. âThe
girlâs too young,â he says. But I know what he is thinking. He wants to keep
them bowing to him. Heâs been acting shamefully about that girl. Still, they
will get her for LukÃ¡shka, because he is the best Cossack in the village, a
brave, who has killed an
abrek
and will be rewarded with a cross.â

âBut how about this? When I was walking up and down the yard last night, I saw
my landlordâs daughter and some Cossack kissing,â said OlÃ©nin.

âYouâre pretending!â cried the old man, stopping.

âOn my word,â said OlÃ©nin.

âWomen are the devil,â said ErÃ³shka pondering. âBut what Cossack was it?â

âI couldnât see.â

âWell, what sort of a cap had he, a white one?â

âYes.â

âAnd a red coat? About your height?â

âNo, a bit taller.â

âItâs he!â and ErÃ³shka burst out laughing. âItâs himself, itâs Mark. He is
Luke, but I call him Mark for a joke. His very self! I love him. I was just
such a one myself. Whatâs the good of minding them? My sweetheart used to sleep
with her mother and her sister-in-law, but I managed to get in. She used to
sleep upstairs; that witch her mother was a regular demon; itâs awful how she
hated me. Well, I used to come with a chum, GÃ­rchik his name was. Weâd come
under her window and Iâd climb on his shoulders, push up the window and begin
groping about. She used to sleep just there on a bench. Once I woke her up and
she nearly called out. She hadnât recognized me. âWho is there?â she said, and
I could not answer. Her mother was even beginning to stir, but I took off my
cap and shoved it over her mouth; and she at once knew it by a seam in it, and
ran out to me. I used not to want anything then. Sheâd bring along clotted
cream and grapes and everything,â added ErÃ³shka (who always explained things
practically), âand she wasnât the only one. It was a life!â

âAnd what now?â

âNow weâll follow the dog, get a pheasant to settle on a tree, and then you may
fire.â

âWould you have made up to MaryÃ¡nka?â

âAttend to the dogs. Iâll tell you tonight,â said the old man, pointing to his
favourite dog, Lyam.

After a pause they continued talking, while they went about a hundred paces.
Then the old man stopped again and pointed to a twig that lay across the path.

âWhat do you think of that?â he said. âYou think itâs nothing? Itâs bad that
this stick is lying so.â

âWhy is it bad?â

He smiled.

âAh, you donât know anything. Just listen to me. When a stick lies like that
donât you step across it, but go round it or throw it off the path this way,
and say âFather and Son and Holy Ghost,â and then go on with Godâs blessing.
Nothing will happen to you. Thatâs what the old men used to teach me.â

âCome, what rubbish!â said OlÃ©nin. âYouâd better tell me more about MaryÃ¡nka.
Does she carry on with LukÃ¡shka?â

âHush ... be quiet now!â the old man again interrupted in a whisper: âjust
listen, weâll go round through the forest.â

And the old man, stepping quietly in his soft shoes, led the way by a narrow
path leading into the dense, wild, overgrown forest. Now and again with a frown
he turned to look at OlÃ©nin, who rustled and clattered with his heavy boots
and, carrying his gun carelessly, several times caught the twigs of trees that
grew across the path.

âDonât make a noise. Step softly, soldier!â the old man whispered angrily.

There was a feeling in the air that the sun had risen. The mist was dissolving
but it still enveloped the tops of the trees. The forest looked terribly high.
At every step the aspect changed: what had appeared like a tree proved to be a
bush, and a reed looked like a tree.

Chapter XIX

The mist had partly lifted, showing the wet reed thatches, and was now turning
into dew that moistened the road and the grass beside the fence. Smoke rose
everywhere in clouds from the chimneys. The people were going out of the
village, some to their work, some to the river, and some to the cordon. The
hunters walked together along the damp, grass-grown path. The dogs, wagging
their tails and looking at their masters, ran on both sides of them. Myriads of
gnats hovered in the air and pursued the hunters, covering their backs, eyes,
and hands. The air was fragrant with the grass and with the dampness of the
forest. OlÃ©nin continually looked round at the ox-cart in which MaryÃ¡nka sat
urging on the oxen with a long switch.

It was calm. The sounds from the village, audible at first, now no longer
reached the sportsmen. Only the brambles cracked as the dogs ran under them,
and now and then birds called to one another. OlÃ©nin knew that danger lurked in
the forest, that
abreks
always hid in such places. But he knew too that
in the forest, for a man on foot, a gun is a great protection. Not that he was
afraid, but he felt that another in his place might be; and looking into the
damp misty forest and listening to the rare and faint sounds with strained
attention, he changed his hold on his gun and experienced a pleasant feeling
that was new to him. Daddy ErÃ³shka went in front, stopping and carefully
scanning every puddle where an animal had left a double track, and pointing it
out to OlÃ©nin. He hardly spoke at all and only occasionally made remarks in a
whisper. The track they were following had once been made by wagons, but the
grass had long overgrown it. The elm and plane-tree forest on both sides of
them was so dense and overgrown with creepers that it was impossible to see
anything through it. Nearly every tree was enveloped from top to bottom with
wild grape vines, and dark bramble bushes covered the ground thickly. Every
little glade was overgrown with blackberry bushes and grey feathery reeds. In
places, large hoof-prints and small funnel-shaped pheasant-trails led from the
path into the thicket. The vigour of the growth of this forest, untrampled by
cattle, struck OlÃ©nin at every turn, for he had never seen anything like it.
This forest, the danger, the old man and his mysterious whispering, MaryÃ¡nka
with her virile upright bearing, and the mountainsâall this seemed to him like
a dream.

âA pheasant has settled,â whispered the old man, looking round and pulling his
cap over his faceââCover your mug! A pheasant!â he waved his arm angrily at
OlÃ©nin and pushed forward almost on all fours. âHe donât like a manâs mug.â

OlÃ©nin was still behind him when the old man stopped and began examining a
tree. A cock-pheasant on the tree clucked at the dog that was barking at it,
and OlÃ©nin saw the pheasant; but at that moment a report, as of a cannon, came
from ErÃ³shkaâs enormous gun, the bird fluttered up and, losing some feathers,
fell to the ground. Coming up to the old man OlÃ©nin disturbed another, and
raising his gun he aimed and fired. The pheasant flew swiftly up and then,
catching at the branches as he fell, dropped like a stone to the ground.

âGood man!â the old man (who could not hit a flying bird) shouted, laughing.

Having picked up the pheasants they went on. OlÃ©nin, excited by the exercise
and the praise, kept addressing remarks to the old man.

âStop! Come this way,â the old man interrupted. âI noticed the track of deer
here yesterday.â

After they had turned into the thicket and gone some three hundred paces they
scrambled through into a glade overgrown with reeds and partly under water.
OlÃ©nin failed to keep up with the old huntsman and presently Daddy ErÃ³shka,
some twenty paces in front, stooped down, nodding and beckoning with his arm.
On coming up with him OlÃ©nin saw a manâs footprint to which the old man was
pointing.

âDâyou see?â

âYes, well?â said OlÃ©nin, trying to speak as calmly as he could. âA manâs
footstep!â

Involuntarily a thought of Cooperâs
Pathfinder
and of
abreks

flashed through OlÃ©ninâs mind, but noticing the mysterious manner with which
the old man moved on, he hesitated to question him and remained in doubt
whether this mysteriousness was caused by fear of danger or by the sport.

âNo, itâs my own footprint,â the old man said quietly, and pointed to some
grass under which the track of an animal was just perceptible.

The old man went on, and OlÃ©nin kept up with him. Descending to lower ground
some twenty paces farther on they came upon a spreading pear-tree, under which,
on the black earth, lay the fresh dung of some animal.

The spot, all covered over with wild vines, was like a cosy arbour, dark and
cool.

âHeâs been here this morning,â said the old man with a sigh; âthe lair is still
damp, quite fresh.â

Suddenly they heard a terrible crash in the forest some ten paces from where
they stood. They both started and seized their guns, but they could see nothing
and only heard the branches breaking. The rhythmical rapid thud of galloping
was heard for a moment and then changed into a hollow rumble which resounded
farther and farther off, re-echoing in wider and wider circles through the
forest. OlÃ©nin felt as though something had snapped in his heart. He peered
carefully but vainly into the green thicket and then turned to the old man.
Daddy ErÃ³shka with his gun pressed to his breast stood motionless; his cap was
thrust backwards, his eyes gleamed with an unwonted glow, and his open mouth,
with its worn yellow teeth, seemed to have stiffened in that position.

âA horned stag!â he muttered, and throwing down his gun in despair he began
pulling at his grey beard, âHere it stood. We should have come round by the
path.... Fool! fool!â and he gave his beard an angry tug. âFool! Pig!â he
repeated, pulling painfully at his own beard. Through the forest something
seemed to fly away in the mist, and ever farther and farther off was heard the
sound of the flight of the stag.

It was already dusk when, hungry, tired, but full of vigour, OlÃ©nin returned
with the old man. Dinner was ready. He ate and drank with the old man till he
felt warm and merry. OlÃ©nin then went out into the porch. Again, to the west,
the mountains rose before his eyes. Again the old man told his endless stories
of hunting, of
abreks
, of sweethearts, and of all that free and reckless
life. Again the fair MaryÃ¡nka went in and out and across the yard, her
beautiful powerful form outlined by her smock.

Chapter XX

The next day OlÃ©nin went alone to the spot where he and the old man startled
the stag. Instead of passing round through the gate he climbed over the prickly
hedge, as everybody else did, and before he had had time to pull out the thorns
that had caught in his coat, his dog, which had run on in front, started two
pheasants. He had hardly stepped among the briers when the pheasants began to
rise at every step (the old man had not shown him that place the day before as
he meant to keep it for shooting from behind the screen). OlÃ©nin fired twelve
times and killed five pheasants, but clambering after them through the briers
he got so fatigued that he was drenched with perspiration. He called off his
dog, uncocked his gun, put in a bullet above the small shot, and brushing away
the mosquitoes with the wide sleeve of his Circassian coat he went slowly to
the spot where they had been the day before. It was however impossible to keep
back the dog, who found trails on the very path, and OlÃ©nin killed two more
pheasants, so that after being detained by this it was getting towards noon
before he began to find the place he was looking for.

The day was perfectly clear, calm, and hot. The morning moisture had dried up
even in the forest, and myriads of mosquitoes literally covered his face, his
back, and his arms. His dog had turned from black to grey, its back being
covered with mosquitoes, and so had OlÃ©ninâs coat through which the insects
thrust their stings. OlÃ©nin was ready to run away from them and it seemed to
him that it was impossible to live in this country in the summer. He was about
to go home, but remembering that other people managed to endure such pain he
resolved to bear it and gave himself up to be devoured. And strange to say, by
noontime the feeling became actually pleasant. He even felt that without this
mosquito-filled atmosphere around him, and that mosquito-paste mingled with
perspiration which his hand smeared over his face, and that unceasing
irritation all over his body, the forest would lose for him some of its
character and charm. These myriads of insects were so well suited to that
monstrously lavish wild vegetation, these multitudes of birds and beasts which
filled the forest, this dark foliage, this hot scented air, these runlets
filled with turbid water which everywhere soaked through from the TÃ©rek and
gurgled here and there under the overhanging leaves, that the very thing which
had at first seemed to him dreadful and intolerable now seemed pleasant. After
going round the place where yesterday they had found the animal and not finding
anything, he felt inclined to rest. The sun stood right above the forest and
poured its perpendicular rays down on his back and head whenever he came out
into a glade or onto the road. The seven heavy pheasants dragged painfully at
his waist. Having found the traces of yesterdayâs stag he crept under a bush
into the thicket just where the stag had lain, and lay down in its lair. He
examined the dark foliage around him, the place marked by the stagâs
perspiration and yesterdayâs dung, the imprint of the stagâs knees, the bit of
black earth it had kicked up, and his own footprints of the day before. He felt
cool and comfortable and did not think of or wish for anything. And suddenly he
was overcome by such a strange feeling of causeless joy and of love for
everything, that from an old habit of his childhood he began crossing himself
and thanking someone. Suddenly, with extraordinary clearness, he thought: âHere
am I, DmÃ­tri OlÃ©nin, a being quite distinct from every other being, now lying
all alone Heaven only knows whereâwhere a stag used to liveâan old stag, a
beautiful stag who perhaps had never seen a man, and in a place where no human
being has ever sat or thought these thoughts. Here I sit, and around me stand
old and young trees, one of them festooned with wild grape vines, and pheasants
are fluttering, driving one another about and perhaps scenting their murdered
brothers.â He felt his pheasants, examined them, and wiped the warm blood off
his hand onto his coat. âPerhaps the jackals scent them and with dissatisfied
faces go off in another direction: above me, flying in among the leaves which
to them seem enormous islands, mosquitoes hang in the air and buzz: one, two,
three, four, a hundred, a thousand, a million mosquitoes, and all of them buzz
something or other and each one of them is separate from all else and is just
such a separate DmÃ­tri OlÃ©nin as I am myself.â He vividly imagined what the
mosquitoes buzzed: âThis way, this way, lads! Hereâs some one we can eat!â They
buzzed and stuck to him. And it was clear to him that he was not a Russian
nobleman, a member of Moscow society, the friend and relation of so-and-so and
so-and-so, but just such a mosquito, or pheasant, or deer, as those that were
now living all around him. âJust as they, just as Daddy ErÃ³shka, I shall live
awhile and die, and as he says truly: âgrass will grow and nothing moreâ.â

âBut what though the grass does grow?â he continued thinking. âStill I must
live and be happy, because happiness is all I desire. Never mind what I amâan
animal like all the rest, above whom the grass will grow and nothing more; or a
frame in which a bit of the one God has been set,âstill I must live in the very
best way. How then must I live to be happy, and why was I not happy before?â
And he began to recall his former life and he felt disgusted with himself. He
appeared to himself to have been terribly exacting and selfish, though he now
saw that all the while he really needed nothing for himself. And he looked
round at the foliage with the light shining through it, at the setting sun and
the clear sky, and he felt just as happy as before. âWhy am I happy, and what
used I to live for?â thought he. âHow much I exacted for myself; how I schemed
and did not manage to gain anything but shame and sorrow! and, there now, I
require nothing to be happy;â and suddenly a new light seemed to reveal itself
to him. âHappiness is this!â he said to himself. âHappiness lies in living for
others. That is evident. The desire for happiness is innate in every man;
therefore it is legitimate. When trying to satisfy it selfishlyâthat is, by
seeking for oneself riches, fame, comforts, or loveâit may happen that
circumstances arise which make it impossible to satisfy these desires. It
follows that it is these desires that are illegitimate, but not the need for
happiness. But what desires can always be satisfied despite external
circumstances? What are they? Love, self-sacrifice.â He was so glad and excited
when he had discovered this, as it seemed to him, new truth, that he jumped up
and began impatiently seeking some one to sacrifice himself for, to do good to
and to love. âSince one wants nothing for oneself,â he kept thinking, âwhy not
live for others?â He took up his gun with the intention of returning home
quickly to think this out and to find an opportunity of doing good. He made his
way out of the thicket. When he had come out into the glade he looked around
him; the sun was no longer visible above the tree-tops. It had grown cooler and
the place seemed to him quite strange and not like the country round the
village. Everything seemed changedâthe weather and the character of the forest;
the sky was wrapped in clouds, the wind was rustling in the tree-tops, and all
around nothing was visible but reeds and dying broken-down trees. He called to
his dog who had run away to follow some animal, and his voice came back as in a
desert. And suddenly he was seized with a terrible sense of weirdness. He grew
frightened. He remembered the
abreks
and the murders he had been told
about, and he expected every moment that an
abrek
would spring from
behind every bush and he would have to defend his life and die, or be a coward.
He thought of God and of the future life as for long he had not thought about
them. And all around was that same gloomy stern wild nature. âAnd is it worth
while living for oneself,â thought he, âwhen at any moment you may die, and die
without having done any good, and so that no one will know of it?â He went in
the direction where he fancied the village lay. Of his shooting he had no
further thought; but he felt tired to death and peered round at every bush and
tree with particular attention and almost with terror, expecting every moment
to be called to account for his life. After having wandered about for a
considerable time he came upon a ditch down which was flowing cold sandy water
from the TÃ©rek, and, not to go astray any longer, he decided to follow it. He
went on without knowing where the ditch would lead him. Suddenly the reeds
behind him crackled. He shuddered and seized his gun, and then felt ashamed of
himself: the over-excited dog, panting hard, had thrown itself into the cold
water of the ditch and was lapping it!

He too had a drink, and then followed the dog in the direction it wished to go,
thinking it would lead him to the village. But despite the dogâs company
everything around him seemed still more dreary. The forest grew darker and the
wind grew stronger and stronger in the tops of the broken old trees. Some large
birds circled screeching round their nests in those trees. The vegetation grew
poorer and he came oftener and oftener upon rustling reeds and bare sandy
spaces covered with animal footprints. To the howling of the wind was added
another kind of cheerless monotonous roar. Altogether his spirits became
gloomy. Putting his hand behind him he felt his pheasants, and found one
missing. It had broken off and was lost, and only the bleeding head and beak
remained sticking in his belt. He felt more frightened than he had ever done
before. He began to pray to God, and feared above all that he might die without
having done anything good or kind; and he so wanted to live, and to live so as
to perform a feat of self-sacrifice.

Chapter XXI

Suddenly it was as though the sun had shone into his soul. He heard Russian
being spoken, and also heard the rapid smooth flow of the TÃ©rek, and a few
steps farther in front of him saw the brown moving surface of the river, with
the dim-coloured wet sand of its banks and shallows, the distant steppe, the
cordon watch-tower outlined above the water, a saddled and hobbled horse among
the brambles, and then the mountains opening out before him. The red sun
appeared for an instant from under a cloud and its last rays glittered brightly
along the river over the reeds, on the watch-tower, and on a group of Cossacks,
among whom LukÃ¡shkaâs vigorous figure attracted OlÃ©ninâs involuntary attention.

OlÃ©nin felt that he was again, without any apparent cause, perfectly happy. He
had come upon the NÃ­zhni-ProtÃ³tsk post on the TÃ©rek, opposite a pro-Russian
Tartar village on the other side of the river. He accosted the Cossacks, but
not finding as yet any excuse for doing anyone a kindness, he entered the hut;
nor in the hut did he find any such opportunity. The Cossacks received him
coldly. On entering the mud hut he lit a cigarette. The Cossacks paid little
attention to him, first because he was smoking a cigarette, and secondly
because they had something else to divert them that evening. Some hostile
ChÃ©chens, relatives of the
abrek
who had been killed, had come from the
hills with a scout to ransom the body; and the Cossacks were waiting for their
Commanding Officerâs arrival from the village. The dead manâs brother, tall and
well shaped with a short cropped beard which was dyed red, despite his very
tattered coat and cap was calm and majestic as a king. His face was very like
that of the dead
abrek
. He did not deign to look at anyone, and never
once glanced at the dead body, but sitting on his heels in the shade he spat as
he smoked his short pipe, and occasionally uttered some few guttural sounds of
command, which were respectfully listened to by his companion. He was evidently
a brave who had met Russians more than once before in quite other
circumstances, and nothing about them could astonish or even interest him.
OlÃ©nin was about to approach the dead body and had begun to look at it when the
brother, looking up at him from under his brows with calm contempt, said
something sharply and angrily. The scout hastened to cover the dead manâs face
with his coat. OlÃ©nin was struck by the dignified and stern expression of the
braveâs face. He began to speak to him, asking from what village he came, but
the ChÃ©chen, scarcely giving him a glance, spat contemptuously and turned away.
OlÃ©nin was so surprised at the ChÃ©chen not being interested in him that he
could only put it down to the manâs stupidity or ignorance of Russian; so he
turned to the scout, who also acted as interpreter. The scout was as ragged as
the other, but instead of being red-haired he was black-haired, restless, with
extremely white gleaming teeth and sparkling black eyes. The scout willingly
entered into conversation and asked for a cigarette.

âThere were five brothers,â began the scout in his broken Russian. âThis is the
third brother the Russians have killed, only two are left. He is a brave, a
great brave!â he said, pointing to the ChÃ©chen. âWhen they killed Ahmet Khan
(the dead brave) this one was sitting on the opposite bank among the reeds. He
saw it all. Saw him laid in the skiff and brought to the bank. He sat there
till the night and wished to kill the old man, but the others would not let
him.â

LukÃ¡shka went up to the speaker, and sat down. âOf what village?â asked he.

âFrom there in the hills,â replied the scout, pointing to the misty bluish
gorge beyond the TÃ©rek. âDo you know Suuk-su? It is about eight miles beyond
that.â

âDo you know GirÃ©y Khan in Suuk-su?â asked LukÃ¡shka, evidently proud of the
acquaintance. âHe is my
kunak
.â

âHe is my neighbour,â answered the scout.

âHeâs a trump!â and LukÃ¡shka, evidently much interested, began talking to the
scout in Tartar.

Presently a Cossack captain, with the head of the village, arrived on horseback
with a suite of two Cossacks. The captainâone of the new type of Cossack
officersâwished the Cossacks âGood health,â but no one shouted in reply, âHail!
Good health to your honour,â as is customary in the Russian Army, and only a
few replied with a bow. Some, and among them LukÃ¡shka, rose and stood erect.
The corporal replied that all was well at the outposts. All this seemed
ridiculous: it was as if these Cossacks were playing at being soldiers. But
these formalities soon gave place to ordinary ways of behaviour, and the
captain, who was a smart Cossack just like the others, began speaking fluently
in Tartar to the interpreter. They filled in some document, gave it to the
scout, and received from him some money. Then they approached the body.

âWhich of you is Luke GavrÃ­lov?â asked the captain.

LukÃ¡shka took off his cap and came forward.

âI have reported your exploit to the Commander. I donât know what will come of
it. I have recommended you for a cross; youâre too young to be made a sergeant.
Can you read?â

âI canât.â

âBut what a fine fellow to look at!â said the captain, again playing the
commander. âPut on your cap. Which of the GavrÃ­lovs does he come of? ... the
Broad, eh?â

âHis nephew,â replied the corporal.

âI know, I know. Well, lend a hand, help them,â he said, turning to the
Cossacks.

LukÃ¡shkaâs face shone with joy and seemed handsomer than usual. He moved away
from the corporal, and having put on his cap sat down beside OlÃ©nin.

When the body had been carried to the skiff the brother ChÃ©chen descended to
the bank. The Cossacks involuntarily stepped aside to let him pass. He jumped
into the boat and pushed off from the bank with his powerful leg, and now, as
OlÃ©nin noticed, for the first time threw a rapid glance at all the Cossacks and
then abruptly asked his companion a question. The latter answered something and
pointed to LukÃ¡shka. The ChÃ©chen looked at him and, turning slowly away, gazed
at the opposite bank. That look expressed not hatred but cold contempt. He
again made some remark.

âWhat is he saying?â OlÃ©nin asked of the fidgety scout.

âYours kill ours, ours slay yours. Itâs always the same,â replied the scout,
evidently inventing, and he smiled, showing his white teeth, as he jumped into
the skiff.

The dead manâs brother sat motionless, gazing at the opposite bank. He was so
full of hatred and contempt that there was nothing on this side of the river
that moved his curiosity. The scout, standing up at one end of the skiff and
dipping his paddle now on one side now on the other, steered skilfully while
talking incessantly. The skiff became smaller and smaller as it moved obliquely
across the stream, the voices became scarcely audible, and at last, still
within sight, they landed on the opposite bank where their horses stood
waiting. There they lifted out the corpse and (though the horse shied) laid it
across one of the saddles, mounted, and rode at a foot-pace along the road past
a Tartar village from which a crowd came out to look at them. The Cossacks on
the Russian side of the river were highly satisfied and jovial. Laughter and
jokes were heard on all sides. The captain and the head of the village entered
the mud hut to regale themselves. LukÃ¡shka, vainly striving to impart a sedate
expression to his merry face, sat down with his elbows on his knees beside
OlÃ©nin and whittled away at a stick.

âWhy do you smoke?â he said with assumed curiosity. âIs it good?â

He evidently spoke because he noticed OlÃ©nin felt ill at ease and isolated
among the Cossacks.

âItâs just a habit,â answered OlÃ©nin. âWhy?â

âHâm, if one of us were to smoke there would be a row! Look there now, the
mountains are not far off,â continued LukÃ¡shka, âyet you canât get there! How
will you get back alone? Itâs getting dark. Iâll take you, if you like. You ask
the corporal to give me leave.â

âWhat a fine fellow!â thought OlÃ©nin, looking at the Cossackâs bright face. He
remembered MaryÃ¡nka and the kiss he had heard by the gate, and he was sorry for
LukÃ¡shka and his want of culture. âWhat confusion it is,â he thought. âA man
kills another and is happy and satisfied with himself as if he had done
something excellent. Can it be that nothing tells him that it is not a reason
for any rejoicing, and that happiness lies not in killing, but in sacrificing
oneself?â

âWell, you had better not meet him again now, mate!â said one of the Cossacks
who had seen the skiff off, addressing LukÃ¡shka. âDid you hear him asking about
you?â

LukÃ¡shka raised his head.

âMy godson?â said LukÃ¡shka, meaning by that word the dead ChÃ©chen.

âYour godson wonât rise, but the red one is the godsonâs brother!â

âLet him thank God that he got off whole himself,â replied LukÃ¡shka.

âWhat are you glad about?â asked OlÃ©nin. âSupposing your brother had been
killed; would you be glad?â

The Cossack looked at OlÃ©nin with laughing eyes. He seemed to have understood
all that OlÃ©nin wished to say to him, but to be above such considerations.

âWell, that happens too! Donât our fellows get killed sometimes?â

Chapter XXII

The Captain and the head of the village rode away, and OlÃ©nin, to please
LukÃ¡shka as well as to avoid going back alone through the dark forest, asked
the corporal to give LukÃ¡shka leave, and the corporal did so. OlÃ©nin thought
that LukÃ¡shka wanted to see MaryÃ¡nka and he was also glad of the companionship
of such a pleasant-looking and sociable Cossack. LukÃ¡shka and MaryÃ¡nka he
involuntarily united in his mind, and he found pleasure in thinking about them.
âHe loves MaryÃ¡nka,â thought OlÃ©nin, âand I could love her,â and a new and
powerful emotion of tenderness overcame him as they walked homewards together
through the dark forest. LukÃ¡shka too felt happy; something akin to love made
itself felt between these two very different young men. Every time they glanced
at one another they wanted to laugh.

âBy which gate do you enter?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âBy the middle one. But Iâll see you as far as the marsh. After that you have
nothing to fear.â

OlÃ©nin laughed.

âDo you think I am afraid? Go back, and thank you. I can get on alone.â

âItâs all right! What have I to do? And how can you help being afraid? Even we
are afraid,â said LukÃ¡shka to set OlÃ©ninâs self-esteem at rest, and he laughed
too.

âThen come in with me. Weâll have a talk and a drink and in the morning you can
go back.â

âCouldnât I find a place to spend the night?â laughed LukÃ¡shka. âBut the
corporal asked me to go back.â

âI heard you singing last night, and also saw you.â

âEvery one...â and Luke swayed his head.

âIs it true you are getting married?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âMother wants me to marry. But I have not got a horse yet.â

âArenât you in the regular service?â

âOh dear no! Iâve only just joined, and have not got a horse yet, and donât
know how to get one. Thatâs why the marriage does not come off.â

âAnd what would a horse cost?â

âWe were bargaining for one beyond the river the other day and they would not
take sixty rubles for it, though it is a NogÃ¡y horse.â

âWill you come and be my drabÃ¡nt?â (A drabÃ¡nt was a kind of orderly attached to
an officer when campaigning.) âIâll get it arranged and will give you a horse,â
said OlÃ©nin suddenly. âReally now, I have two and I donât want both.â

âHowâdonât want it?â LukÃ¡shka said, laughing. âWhy should you make me a
present? Weâll get on by ourselves by Godâs help.â

âNo, really! Or donât you want to be a drabÃ¡nt?â said OlÃ©nin, glad that it had
entered his head to give a horse to LukÃ¡shka, though, without knowing why, he
felt uncomfortable and confused and did not know what to say when he tried to
speak.

LukÃ¡shka was the first to break the silence.

âHave you a house of your own in Russia?â he asked.

OlÃ©nin could not refrain from replying that he had not only one, but several
houses.

âA good house? Bigger than ours?â asked LukÃ¡shka good-naturedly.

âMuch bigger; ten times as big and three storeys high,â replied OlÃ©nin.

âAnd have you horses such as ours?â

âI have a hundred horses, worth three or four hundred rubles each, but they are
not like yours. They are trotters, you know.... But still, I like the horses
here best.â

âWell, and did you come here of your own free will, or were you sent?â said
LukÃ¡shka, laughing at him. âLook! thatâs where you lost your way,â he added,
âyou should have turned to the right.â

âI came by my own wish,â replied OlÃ©nin. âI wanted to see your parts and to
join some expeditions.â

âI would go on an expedition any day,â said LukÃ¡shka. âDâyou hear the jackals
howling?â he added, listening.

âI say, donât you feel any horror at having killed a man?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âWhatâs there to be frightened about? But I should like to join an expedition,â
LukÃ¡shka repeated. âHow I want to! How I want to!â

âPerhaps we may be going together. Our company is going before the holidays,
and your âhundredâ too.â

âAnd what did you want to come here for? Youâve a house and horses and serfs.
In your place Iâd do nothing but make merry! And what is your rank?â

âI am a cadet, but have been recommended for a commission.â

âWell, if youâre not bragging about your home, if I were you Iâd never have
left it! Yes, Iâd never have gone away anywhere. Do you find it pleasant living
among us?â

âYes, very pleasant,â answered OlÃ©nin.

It had grown quite dark before, talking in this way, they approached the
village. They were still surrounded by the deep gloom of the forest. The wind
howled through the tree-tops. The jackals suddenly seemed to be crying close
beside them, howling, chuckling, and sobbing; but ahead of them in the village
the sounds of womenâs voices and the barking of dogs could already be heard;
the outlines of the huts were clearly to be seen; lights gleamed and the air
was filled with the peculiar smell of
kisyak
smoke. OlÃ©nin felt keenly,
that night especially, that here in this village was his home, his family, all
his happiness, and that he never had and never would live so happily anywhere
as he did in this Cossack village. He was so fond of everybody and especially
of LukÃ¡shka that night. On reaching home, to LukÃ¡shkaâs great surprise, OlÃ©nin
with his own hands led out of the shed a horse he had bought in GrÃ³znoeâit was
not the one he usually rode but anotherânot a bad horse though no longer young,
and gave it to LukÃ¡shka.

âWhy should you give me a present?â said LukÃ¡shka, âI have not yet done
anything for you.â

âReally it is nothing,â answered OlÃ©nin. âTake it, and you will give me a
present, and weâll go on an expedition against the enemy together.â

LukÃ¡shka became confused.

âBut what dâyou mean by it? As if a horse were of little value,â he said
without looking at the horse.

âTake it, take it! If you donât you will offend me. VanyÃºsha! Take the grey
horse to his house.â

LukÃ¡shka took hold of the halter.

âWell then, thank you! This is something unexpected, undreamt of.â

OlÃ©nin was as happy as a boy of twelve.

âTie it up here. Itâs a good horse. I bought it in GrÃ³znoe; it gallops
splendidly! VanyÃºsha, bring us some
chikhir
. Come into the hut.â

The wine was brought. LukÃ¡shka sat down and took the wine-bowl.

âGod willing Iâll find a way to repay you,â he said, finishing his wine. âHow
are you called?â

âDmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich.â

âWell, âMitry AndrÃ©ich, God bless you. We will be
kunaks
. Now you must
come to see us. Though we are not rich people still we can treat a

kunak
, and I will tell mother in case you need anythingâclotted cream or
grapesâand if you come to the cordon Iâm your servant to go hunting or to go
across the river, anywhere you like! There now, only the other day, what a boar
I killed, and I divided it among the Cossacks, but if I had only known, Iâd
have given it to you.â

âThatâs all right, thank you! But donât harness the horse, it has never been in
harness.â

âWhy harness the horse? And there is something else Iâll tell you if you like,â
said LukÃ¡shka, bending his head. âI have a
kunak
, GirÃ©y Khan. He asked
me to lie in ambush by the road where they come down from the mountains. Shall
we go together? Iâll not betray you. Iâll be your
murid
.â

âYes, weâll go; weâll go some day.â

LukÃ¡shka seemed quite to have quieted down and to have understood OlÃ©ninâs
attitude towards him. His calmness and the ease of his behaviour surprised
OlÃ©nin, and he did not even quite like it. They talked long, and it was late
when LukÃ¡shka, not tipsy (he never was tipsy) but having drunk a good deal,
left OlÃ©nin after shaking hands.

OlÃ©nin looked out of the window to see what he would do. LukÃ¡shka went out,
hanging his head. Then, having led the horse out of the gate, he suddenly shook
his head, threw the reins of the halter over its head, sprang onto its back
like a cat, gave a wild shout, and galloped down the street. OlÃ©nin expected
that LukÃ¡shka would go to share his joy with MaryÃ¡nka, but though he did not do
so OlÃ©nin still felt his soul more at ease than ever before in his life. He was
as delighted as a boy, and could not refrain from telling VanyÃºsha not only
that he had given LukÃ¡shka the horse, but also why he had done it, as well as
his new theory of happiness.

VanyÃºsha did not approve of his theory, and announced that â
lâargent il nây
a pas!
â and that therefore it was all nonsense.

LukÃ¡shka rode home, jumped off the horse, and handed it over to his mother,
telling her to let it out with the communal Cossack herd. He himself had to
return to the cordon that same night. His deaf sister undertook to take the
horse, and explained by signs that when she saw the man who had given the
horse, she would bow down at his feet. The old woman only shook her head at her
sonâs story, and decided in her own mind that he had stolen it. She therefore
told the deaf girl to take it to the herd before daybreak.

LukÃ¡shka went back alone to the cordon pondering over OlÃ©ninâs action. Though
he did not consider the horse a good one, yet it was worth at least forty
rubles and LukÃ¡shka was very glad to have the present. But why it had been
given him he could not at all understand, and therefore he did not experience
the least feeling of gratitude. On the contrary, vague suspicions that the
cadet had some evil intentions filled his mind. What those intentions were he
could not decide, but neither could he admit the idea that a stranger would
give him a horse worth forty rubles for nothing, just out of kindness; it
seemed impossible. Had he been drunk one might understand it! He might have
wished to show off. But the cadet had been sober, and therefore must have
wished to bribe him to do something wrong. âEh, humbug!â thought LukÃ¡shka.
âHavenât I got the horse and weâll see later on. Iâm not a fool myself and we
shall see whoâll get the better of the other,â he thought, feeling the
necessity of being on his guard, and therefore arousing in himself unfriendly
feelings towards OlÃ©nin. He told no one how he had got the horse. To some he
said he had bought it, to others he replied evasively. However, the truth soon
got about in the village, and LukÃ¡shkaâs mother and MaryÃ¡nka, as well as Elias
VasÃ­lich and other Cossacks, when they heard of OlÃ©ninâs unnecessary gift, were
perplexed, and began to be on their guard against the cadet. But despite their
fears his action aroused in them a great respect for his simplicity and wealth.

âHave you heard,â said one, âthat the cadet quartered on Elias VasÃ­lich has
thrown a fifty-ruble horse at LukÃ¡shka? Heâs rich! ...â

âYes, I heard of it,â replied another profoundly, âhe must have done him some
great service. We shall see what will come of this cadet. Eh! what luck that
Snatcher has!â

âThose cadets are crafty, awfully crafty,â said a third. âSee if he donât go
setting fire to a building, or doing something!â

Chapter XXIII

OlÃ©ninâs life went on with monotonous regularity. He had little intercourse
with the commanding officers or with his equals. The position of a rich cadet
in the Caucasus was peculiarly advantageous in this respect. He was not sent
out to work, or for training. As a reward for going on an expedition he was
recommended for a commission, and meanwhile he was left in peace. The officers
regarded him as an aristocrat and behaved towards him with dignity. Cardplaying
and the officersâ carousals accompanied by the soldier-singers, of which he had
had experience when he was with the detachment, did not seem to him attractive,
and he also avoided the society and life of the officers in the village. The
life of officers stationed in a Cossack village has long had its own definite
form. Just as every cadet or officer when in a fort regularly drinks porter,
plays cards, and discusses the rewards given for taking part in the
expeditions, so in the Cossack villages he regularly drinks
chikhir
with
his hosts, treats the girls to sweet-meats and honey, dangles after the Cossack
women, and falls in love, and occasionally marries there. OlÃ©nin always took
his own path and had an unconscious objection to the beaten tracks. And here,
too, he did not follow the ruts of a Caucasian officerâs life.

It came quite naturally to him to wake up at daybreak. After drinking tea and
admiring from his porch the mountains, the morning, and MaryÃ¡nka, he would put
on a tattered ox-hide coat, sandals of soaked raw hide, buckle on a dagger,
take a gun, put cigarettes and some lunch in a little bag, call his dog, and
soon after five oâclock would start for the forest beyond the village. Towards
seven in the evening he would return tired and hungry with five or six
pheasants hanging from his belt (sometimes with some other animal) and with his
bag of food and cigarettes untouched. If the thoughts in his head had lain like
the lunch and cigarettes in the bag, one might have seen that during all those
fourteen hours not a single thought had moved in it. He returned morally fresh,
strong, and perfectly happy, and he could not tell what he had been thinking
about all the time. Were they ideas, memories, or dreams that had been flitting
through his mind? They were frequently all three. He would rouse himself and
ask what he had been thinking about; and would see himself as a Cossack working
in a vineyard with his Cossack wife, or an
abrek
in the mountains, or a
boar running away from himself. And all the time he kept peering and watching
for a pheasant, a boar, or a deer.

In the evening Daddy ErÃ³shka would be sure to be sitting with him. VanyÃºsha
would bring a jug of
chikhir
, and they would converse quietly, drink,
and separate to go quite contentedly to bed. The next day he would again go
shooting, again be healthily weary, again they would sit conversing and drink
their fill, and again be happy. Sometimes on a holiday or day of rest OlÃ©nin
spent the whole day at home. Then his chief occupation was watching MaryÃ¡nka,
whose every movement, without realizing it himself, he followed greedily from
his window or his porch. He regarded MaryÃ¡nka and loved her (so he thought)
just as he loved the beauty of the mountains and the sky, and he had no thought
of entering into any relations with her. It seemed to him that between him and
her such relations as there were between her and the Cossack LukÃ¡shka could not
exist, and still less such as often existed between rich officers and other
Cossack girls. It seemed to him that if he tried to do as his fellow officers
did, he would exchange his complete enjoyment of contemplation for an abyss of
suffering, disillusionment, and remorse. Besides, he had already achieved a
triumph of self-sacrifice in connexion with her which had given him great
pleasure, and above all he was in a way afraid of MaryÃ¡nka and would not for
anything have ventured to utter a word of love to her lightly.

Once during the summer, when OlÃ©nin had not gone out shooting but was sitting
at home, quite unexpectedly a Moscow acquaintance, a very young man whom he had
met in society, came in.

âAh,
mon cher
, my dear fellow, how glad I was when I heard that you were
here!â he began in his Moscow French, and he went on intermingling French words
in his remarks. âThey said, âOlÃ©ninâ. What OlÃ©nin? and I was so pleased....
Fancy fate bringing us together here! Well, and how are you? How? Why?â and
Prince BelÃ©tski told his whole story: how he had temporarily entered the
regiment, how the Commander-in-Chief had offered to take him as an adjutant,
and how he would take up the post after this campaign although personally he
felt quite indifferent about it.

âLiving here in this hole one must at least make a careerâget a crossâor a
rankâbe transferred to the Guards. That is quite indispensable, not for myself
but for the sake of my relations and friends. The prince received me very well;
he is a very decent fellow,â said BelÃ©tski, and went on unceasingly. âI have
been recommended for the St. Anna Cross for the expedition. Now I shall stay
here a bit until we start on the campaign. Itâs capital here. What women! Well,
and how are you getting on? I was told by our captain, StÃ¡rtsev you know, a
kind-hearted stupid creature.... Well, he said you were living like an awful
savage, seeing no one! I quite understand you donât want to be mixed up with
the set of officers we have here. I am so glad now you and I will be able to
see something of one another. I have put up at the Cossack corporalâs house.
There is such a girl there. Ãstenka! I tell you sheâs just charming.â

And more and more French and Russian words came pouring forth from that world
which OlÃ©nin thought he had left for ever. The general opinion about BelÃ©tski
was that he was a nice, good-natured fellow. Perhaps he really was; but in
spite of his pretty, good-natured face, OlÃ©nin thought him extremely
unpleasant. He seemed just to exhale that filthiness which OlÃ©nin had forsworn.
What vexed him most was that he could notâhad not the strengthâabruptly to
repulse this man who came from that world: as if that old world he used to
belong to had an irresistible claim on him. OlÃ©nin felt angry with BelÃ©tski and
with himself, yet against his wish he introduced French phrases into his own
conversation, was interested in the Commander-in-Chief and in their Moscow
acquaintances, and because in this Cossack village he and BelÃ©tski both spoke
French, he spoke contemptuously of their fellow officers and of the Cossacks,
and was friendly with BelÃ©tski, promising to visit him and inviting him to drop
in to see him. OlÃ©nin however did not himself go to see BelÃ©tski. VanyÃºsha for
his part approved of BelÃ©tski, remarking that he was a real gentleman.

BelÃ©tski at once adopted the customary life of a rich officer in a Cossack
village. Before OlÃ©ninâs eyes, in one month he came to be like an old resident
of the village; he made the old men drunk, arranged evening parties, and
himself went to parties arranged by the girlsâbragged of his conquests, and
even got so far that, for some unknown reason, the women and girls began
calling him grandad, and the Cossacks, to whom a man who loved wine and women
was clearly understandable, got used to him and even liked him better than they
did OlÃ©nin, who was a puzzle to them.

Chapter XXIV

It was five in the morning. VanyÃºsha was in the porch heating the samovar, and
using the leg of a long boot instead of bellows. OlÃ©nin had already ridden off
to bathe in the TÃ©rek. (He had recently invented a new amusement: to swim his
horse in the river.) His landlady was in her outhouse, and the dense smoke of
the kindling fire rose from the chimney. The girl was milking the buffalo cow
in the shed. âCanât keep quiet, the damned thing!â came her impatient voice,
followed by the rhythmical sound of milking.

From the street in front of the house horsesâ hoofs were heard clattering
briskly, and OlÃ©nin, riding bareback on a handsome dark-grey horse which was
still wet and shining, rode up to the gate. MaryÃ¡nkaâs handsome head, tied
round with a red kerchief, appeared from the shed and again disappeared. OlÃ©nin
was wearing a red silk shirt, a white Circassian coat girdled with a strap
which carried a dagger, and a tall cap. He sat his well-fed wet horse with a
slightly conscious elegance and, holding his gun at his back, stooped to open
the gate. His hair was still wet, and his face shone with youth and health. He
thought himself handsome, agile, and like a brave; but he was mistaken. To any
experienced Caucasian he was still only a soldier. When he noticed that the
girl had put out her head he stooped with particular smartness, threw open the
gate and, tightening the reins, swished his whip and entered the yard. âIs tea
ready, VanyÃºsha?â he cried gaily, not looking at the door of the shed. He felt
with pleasure how his fine horse, pressing down its flanks, pulling at the
bridle and with every muscle quivering and with each foot ready to leap over
the fence, pranced on the hard clay of the yard.
âCâest prÃªt
,â answered
VanyÃºsha. OlÃ©nin felt as if MaryÃ¡nkaâs beautiful head was still looking out of
the shed but he did not turn to look at her. As he jumped down from his horse
he made an awkward movement and caught his gun against the porch, and turned a
frightened look towards the shed, where there was no one to be seen and whence
the sound of milking could still be heard.

Soon after he had entered the hut he came out again and sat down with his pipe
and a book on the side of the porch which was not yet exposed to the rays of
the sun. He meant not to go anywhere before dinner that day, and to write some
long-postponed letters; but somehow he felt disinclined to leave his place in
the porch, and he was as reluctant to go back into the hut as if it had been a
prison. The housewife had heated her oven, and the girl, having driven the
cattle, had come back and was collecting
kisyak
and heaping it up along
the fence. OlÃ©nin went on reading, but did not understand a word of what was
written in the book that lay open before him. He kept lifting his eyes from it
and looking at the powerful young woman who was moving about. Whether she
stepped into the moist morning shadow thrown by the house, or went out into the
middle of the yard lit up by the joyous young light, so that the whole of her
stately figure in its bright coloured garment gleamed in the sunshine and cast
a black shadowâhe always feared to lose any one of her movements. It delighted
him to see how freely and gracefully her figure bent: into what folds her only
garment, a pink smock, draped itself on her bosom and along her shapely legs;
how she drew herself up and her tight-drawn smock showed the outline of her
heaving bosom, how the soles of her narrow feet in her worn red slippers rested
on the ground without altering their shape; how her strong arms with the
sleeves rolled up, exerting the muscles, used the spade almost as if in anger,
and how her deep dark eyes sometimes glanced at him. Though the delicate brows
frowned, yet her eyes expressed pleasure and a knowledge of her own beauty.

âI say, OlÃ©nin, have you been up long?â said BelÃ©tski as he entered the yard
dressed in the coat of a Caucasian officer.

âAh, BelÃ©tski,â replied OlÃ©nin, holding out his hand. âHow is it you are out so
early?â

âI had to. I was driven out; we are having a ball tonight. MaryÃ¡nka, of course
youâll come to Ãstenkaâs?â he added, turning to the girl.

OlÃ©nin felt surprised that BelÃ©tski could address this woman so easily. But
MaryÃ¡nka, as though she had not heard him, bent her head, and throwing the
spade across her shoulder went with her firm masculine tread towards the
outhouse.

âSheâs shy, the wench is shy,â BelÃ©tski called after her. âShy of you,â he
added as, smiling gaily, he ran up the steps of the porch.

âHow is it you are having a ball and have been driven out?â

âItâs at Ãstenkaâs, at my landladyâs, that the ball is, and you two are
invited. A ball consists of a pie and a gathering of girls.â

âWhat should we do there?â

BelÃ©tski smiled knowingly and winked, jerking his head in the direction of the
outhouse into which MaryÃ¡nka had disappeared.

OlÃ©nin shrugged his shoulders and blushed.

âWell, really you are a strange fellow!â said he.

âCome now, donât pretendâ

OlÃ©nin frowned, and BelÃ©tski noticing this smiled insinuatingly. âOh, come,
what do you mean?â he said, âliving in the same houseâand such a fine girl, a
splendid girl, a perfect beautyââ

âWonderfully beautiful! I never saw such a woman before,â replied OlÃ©nin.

âWell then?â said BelÃ©tski, quite unable to understand the situation.

âIt may be strange,â replied OlÃ©nin, âbut why should I not say what is true?
Since I have lived here women donât seem to exist for me. And it is so good,
really! Now what can there be in common between us and women like these?
ErÃ³shkaâthatâs a different matter! He and I have a passion in commonâsport.â

âThere now! In common! And what have I in common with AmÃ¡lia IvÃ¡novna? Itâs the
same thing! You may say theyâre not very cleanâthatâs another matter...
Ã la
guerre, comme Ã  la guerre!
...â

âBut I have never known any AmÃ¡lia IvÃ¡novas, and have never known how to behave
with women of that sort,â replied OlÃ©nin. âOne cannot respect them, but these I
do respect.â

âWell go on respecting them! Who wants to prevent you?â

OlÃ©nin did not reply. He evidently wanted to complete what he had begun to say.
It was very near his heart.

âI know I am an exception...â He was visibly confused. âBut my life has so
shaped itself that I not only see no necessity to renounce my rules, but I
could not live here, let alone live as happily as I am doing, were I to live as
you do. Therefore I look for something quite different from what you look for.â

BelÃ©tski raised his eyebrows incredulously. âAnyhow, come to me this evening;
MaryÃ¡nka will be there and I will make you acquainted. Do come, please! If you
feel dull you can go away. Will you come?â

âI would come, but to speak frankly I am afraid of being seriously carried
away.â

âOh, oh, oh!â shouted BelÃ©tski. âOnly come, and Iâll see that you arenât. Will
you? On your word?â

âI would come, but really I donât understand what we shall do; what part we
shall play!â

âPlease, I beg of you. You will come?â

âYes, perhaps Iâll come,â said OlÃ©nin.

âReally now! Charming women such as one sees nowhere else, and to live like a
monk! What an idea! Why spoil your life and not make use of what is at hand?
Have you heard that our company is ordered to VozdvÃ­zhensk?â

âHardly. I was told the 8th Company would be sent there,â said OlÃ©nin.

âNo. I have had a letter from the adjutant there. He writes that the Prince
himself will take part in the campaign. I am very glad I shall see something of
him. Iâm beginning to get tired of this place.â

âI hear we shall start on a raid soon.â

âI have not heard of it; but I have heard that KrinovÃ­tsin has received the
Order of St. Anna for a raid. He expected a lieutenancy,â said BelÃ©tski
laughing. âHe was let in! He has set off for headquarters.â

It was growing dusk and OlÃ©nin began thinking about the party. The invitation
he had received worried him. He felt inclined to go, but what might take place
there seemed strange, absurd, and even rather alarming. He knew that neither
Cossack men nor older women, nor anyone besides the girls, were to be there.
What was going to happen? How was he to behave? What would they talk about?
What connexion was there between him and those wild Cossack girls? BelÃ©tski had
told him of such curious, cynical, and yet rigid relations. It seemed strange
to think that he would be there in the same hut with MaryÃ¡nka and perhaps might
have to talk to her. It seemed to him impossible when he remembered her
majestic bearing. But BelÃ©tski spoke of it as if it were all perfectly simple.
âIs it possible that BelÃ©tski will treat MaryÃ¡nka in the same way? That is
interesting,â thought he. âNo, better not go. Itâs all so horrid, so vulgar,
and above allâit leads to nothing!â But again he was worried by the question of
what would take place; and besides he felt as if bound by a promise. He went
out without having made up his mind one way or the other, but he walked as far
as BelÃ©tskiâs, and went in there.

The hut in which BelÃ©tski lived was like OlÃ©ninâs. It was raised nearly five
feet from the ground on wooden piles, and had two rooms. In the first (which
OlÃ©nin entered by the steep flight of steps) feather beds, rugs, blankets, and
cushions were tastefully and handsomely arranged, Cossack fashion, along the
main wall. On the side wall hung brass basins and weapons, while on the floor,
under a bench, lay watermelons and pumpkins. In the second room there was a big
brick oven, a table, and sectarian icons. It was here that BelÃ©tski was
quartered, with his camp-bed and his pack and trunks. His weapons hung on the
wall with a little rug behind them, and on the table were his toilet appliances
and some portraits. A silk dressing-gown had been thrown on the bench. BelÃ©tski
himself, clean and good-looking, lay on the bed in his underclothing, reading

Les Trois Mousquetaires
.

He jumped up.

âThere, you see how I have arranged things. Fine! Well, itâs good that you have
come. They are working furiously. Do you know what the pie is made of? Dough
with a stuffing of pork and grapes. But thatâs not the point. You just look at
the commotion out there!â

And really, on looking out of the window they saw an unusual bustle going on in
the hut. Girls ran in and out, now for one thing and now for another.

âWill it soon be ready?â cried BelÃ©tski.

âVery soon! Why? Is Grandad hungry?â and from the hut came the sound of ringing
laughter.

Ãstenka, plump, small, rosy, and pretty, with her sleeves turned up, ran into
BelÃ©tskiâs hut to fetch some plates.

âGet away or I shall smash the plates!â she squeaked, escaping from BelÃ©tski.
âYouâd better come and help,â she shouted to OlÃ©nin, laughing. âAnd donât
forget to get some refreshments for the girls.â (âRefreshmentsâ meaning
spicebread and sweets.)

âAnd has MaryÃ¡nka come?â

âOf course! She brought some dough.â

âDo you know,â said BelÃ©tski, âif one were to dress Ãstenka up and clean and
polish her up a bit, sheâd be better than all our beauties. Have you ever seen
that Cossack woman who married a colonel; she was charming! BÃ³rsheva? What
dignity! Where do they get it...â

âI have not seen BÃ³rsheva, but I think nothing could be better than the costume
they wear here.â

âAh, Iâm first-rate at fitting into any kind of life,â said BelÃ©tski with a
sigh of pleasure. âIâll go and see what they are up to.â

He threw his dressing-gown over his shoulders and ran out, shouting, âAnd you
look after the ârefreshmentsâ.â

OlÃ©nin sent BelÃ©tskiâs orderly to buy spice-bread and honey; but it suddenly
seemed to him so disgusting to give money (as if he were bribing someone) that
he gave no definite reply to the orderlyâs question: âHow much spice-bread with
peppermint, and how much with honey?â

âJust as you please.â

âShall I spend all the money,â asked the old soldier impressively. âThe
peppermint is dearer. Itâs sixteen kopeks.â

âYes, yes, spend it all,â answered OlÃ©nin and sat down by the window, surprised
that his heart was thumping as if he were preparing himself for something
serious and wicked.

He heard screaming and shrieking in the girlsâ hut when BelÃ©tski went there,
and a few moments later saw how he jumped out and ran down the steps,
accompanied by shrieks, bustle, and laughter.

âTurned out,â he said.

A little later Ãstenka entered and solemnly invited her visitors to come in:
announcing that all was ready.

When they came into the room they saw that everything was really ready. Ãstenka
was rearranging the cushions along the wall. On the table, which was covered by
a disproportionately small cloth, was a decanter of
chikhir
and some
dried fish. The room smelt of dough and grapes. Some half dozen girls in smart
tunics, with their heads not covered as usual with kerchiefs, were huddled
together in a corner behind the oven, whispering, giggling, and spluttering
with laughter.

âI humbly beg you to do honour to my patron saint,â said Ãstenka, inviting her
guests to the table.

OlÃ©nin noticed MaryÃ¡nka among the group of girls, who without exception were
all handsome, and he felt vexed and hurt that he met her in such vulgar and
awkward circumstances. He felt stupid and awkward, and made up his mind to do
what BelÃ©tski did. BelÃ©tski stepped to the table somewhat solemnly yet with
confidence and ease, drank a glass of wine to Ãstenkaâs health, and invited the
others to do the same. Ãstenka announced that girls donât drink.

âWe might with a little honey,â exclaimed a voice from among the group of
girls.

The orderly, who had just returned with the honey and spice-cakes, was called
in. He looked askance (whether with envy or with contempt) at the gentlemen,
who in his opinion were on the spree; and carefully and conscientiously handed
over to them a piece of honeycomb and the cakes wrapped up in a piece of
greyish paper, and began explaining circumstantially all about the price and
the change, but BelÃ©tski sent him away.

Having mixed honey with wine in the glasses, and having lavishly scattered the
three pounds of spice-cakes on the table, BelÃ©tski dragged the girls from their
corners by force, made them sit down at the table, and began distributing the
cakes among them. OlÃ©nin involuntarily noticed how MaryÃ¡nkaâs sunburnt but
small hand closed on two round peppermint nuts and one brown one, and that she
did not know what to do with them. The conversation was halting and
constrained, in spite of Ãstenkaâs and BelÃ©tskiâs free and easy manner and
their wish to enliven the company. OlÃ©nin faltered, and tried to think of
something to say, feeling that he was exciting curiosity and perhaps provoking
ridicule and infecting the others with his shyness. He blushed, and it seemed
to him that MaryÃ¡nka in particular was feeling uncomfortable. âMost likely they
are expecting us to give them some money,â thought he. âHow are we to do it?
And how can we manage quickest to give it and get away?â

Chapter XXV

âHow is it you donât know your own lodger?â said BelÃ©tski, addressing MaryÃ¡nka.

âHow is one to know him if he never comes to see us?â answered MaryÃ¡nka, with a
look at OlÃ©nin.

OlÃ©nin felt frightened, he did not know of what. He flushed and, hardly knowing
what he was saying, remarked: âIâm afraid of your mother. She gave me such a
scolding the first time I went in.â

MaryÃ¡nka burst out laughing. âAnd so you were frightened?â she said, and
glanced at him and turned away.

It was the first time OlÃ©nin had seen the whole of her beautiful face. Till
then he had seen her with her kerchief covering her to the eyes. It was not for
nothing that she was reckoned the beauty of the village. Ãstenka was a pretty
girl, small, plump, rosy, with merry brown eyes, and red lips which were
perpetually smiling and chattering. MaryÃ¡nka on the contrary was certainly not
pretty but beautiful. Her features might have been considered too masculine and
almost harsh had it not been for her tall stately figure, her powerful chest
and shoulders, and especially the severe yet tender expression of her long dark
eyes which were darkly shadowed beneath their black brows, and for the gentle
expression of her mouth and smile. She rarely smiled, but her smile was always
striking. She seemed to radiate virginal strength and health. All the girls
were good-looking, but they themselves and BelÃ©tski, and the orderly when he
brought in the spice-cakes, all involuntarily gazed at MaryÃ¡nka, and anyone
addressing the girls was sure to address her. She seemed a proud and happy
queen among them.

BelÃ©tski, trying to keep up the spirit of the party, chattered incessantly,
made the girls hand round
chikhir
, fooled about with them, and kept
making improper remarks in French about MaryÃ¡nkaâs beauty to OlÃ©nin, calling
her âyoursâ (
la vÃ´tre
), and advising him to behave as he did himself.
OlÃ©nin felt more and more uncomfortable. He was devising an excuse to get out
and run away when BelÃ©tski announced that Ãstenka, whose saintâs day it was,
must offer
chikhir
to everybody with a kiss. She consented on condition
that they should put money on her plate, as is the custom at weddings.

âWhat fiend brought me to this disgusting feast?â thought OlÃ©nin, rising to go
away.

âWhere are you off to?â

âIâll fetch some tobacco,â he said, meaning to escape, but BelÃ©tski seized his
hand.

âI have some money,â he said to him in French.

âOne canât go away, one has to pay here,â thought OlÃ©nin bitterly, vexed at his
own awkwardness. âCanât I really behave like BelÃ©tski? I ought not to have
come, but once I am here I must not spoil their fun. I must drink like a
Cossack,â and taking the wooden bowl (holding about eight tumblers) he almost
filled it with
chikhir
and drank it almost all. The girls looked at him,
surprised and almost frightened, as he drank. It seemed to them strange and not
right. Ãstenka brought them another glass each, and kissed them both. âThere
girls, now weâll have some fun,â she said, clinking on the plate the four
rubles the men had put there.

OlÃ©nin no longer felt awkward, but became talkative.

âNow, MaryÃ¡nka, itâs your turn to offer us wine and a kiss,â said BelÃ©tski,
seizing her hand.

âYes, Iâll give you such a kiss!â she said playfully, preparing to strike at
him.

âOne can kiss Grandad without payment,â said another girl.

âThereâs a sensible girl,â said BelÃ©tski, kissing the struggling girl. âNo, you
must offer it,â he insisted, addressing MaryÃ¡nka. âOffer a glass to your
lodger.â

And taking her by the hand he led her to the bench and sat her down beside
OlÃ©nin.

âWhat a beauty,â he said, turning her head to see it in profile.

MaryÃ¡nka did not resist but proudly smiling turned her long eyes towards
OlÃ©nin.

âA beautiful girl,â repeated BelÃ©tski.

âYes, see what a beauty I am,â MaryÃ¡nkaâs look seemed to endorse. Without
considering what he was doing OlÃ©nin embraced MaryÃ¡nka and was going to kiss
her, but she suddenly extricated herself, upsetting BelÃ©tski and pushing the
top off the table, and sprang away towards the oven. There was much shouting
and laughter. Then BelÃ©tski whispered something to the girls and suddenly they
all ran out into the passage and locked the door behind them.

âWhy did you kiss BelÃ©tski and wonât kiss me?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âOh, just so. I donât want to, thatâs all!â she answered, pouting and frowning.
âHeâs Grandad,â she added with a smile. She went to the door and began to bang
at it. âWhy have you locked the door, you devils?â

âWell, let them be there and us here,â said OlÃ©nin, drawing closer to her.

She frowned, and sternly pushed him away with her hand. And again she appeared
so majestically handsome to OlÃ©nin that he came to his senses and felt ashamed
of what he was doing. He went to the door and began pulling at it himself.

âBelÃ©tski! Open the door! What a stupid joke!â

MaryÃ¡nka again gave a bright happy laugh. âAh, youâre afraid of me?â she said.

âYes, you know youâre as cross as your mother.â

âSpend more of your time with ErÃ³shka; that will make the girls love you!â And
she smiled, looking straight and close into his eyes.

He did not know what to reply. âAnd if I were to come to see youââ he let fall.

âThat would be a different matter,â she replied, tossing her head.

At that moment BelÃ©tski pushed the door open, and MaryÃ¡nka sprang away from
OlÃ©nin and in doing so her thigh struck his leg.

âItâs all nonsense what I have been thinking aboutâlove and self-sacrifice and
LukÃ¡shka. Happiness is the one thing. He who is happy is right,â flashed
through OlÃ©ninâs mind, and with a strength unexpected to himself he seized and
kissed the beautiful MaryÃ¡nka on her temple and her cheek. MaryÃ¡nka was not
angry, but only burst into a loud laugh and ran out to the other girls.

That was the end of the party. Ãstenkaâs mother, returned from her work, gave
all the girls a scolding, and turned them all out.

Chapter XXVI

âYes,â thought OlÃ©nin, as he walked home. âI need only slacken the reins a bit
and I might fall desperately in love with this Cossack girl.â He went to bed
with these thoughts, but expected it all to blow over and that he would
continue to live as before.

But the old life did not return. His relations to MaryÃ¡nka were changed. The
wall that had separated them was broken down. OlÃ©nin now greeted her every time
they met.

The master of the house having returned to collect the rent, on hearing of
OlÃ©ninâs wealth and generosity invited him to his hut. The old woman received
him kindly, and from the day of the party onwards OlÃ©nin often went in of an
evening and sat with them till late at night. He seemed to be living in the
village just as he used to, but within him everything had changed. He spent his
days in the forest, and towards eight oâclock, when it began to grow dusk, he
would go to see his hosts, alone or with Daddy ErÃ³shka. They grew so used to
him that they were surprised when he stayed away. He paid well for his wine and
was a quiet fellow. VanyÃºsha would bring him his tea and he would sit down in a
corner near the oven. The old woman did not mind him but went on with her work,
and over their tea or their
chikhir
they talked about Cossack affairs,
about the neighbours, or about Russia: OlÃ©nin relating and the others
inquiring. Sometimes he brought a book and read to himself. MaryÃ¡nka crouched
like a wild goat with her feet drawn up under her, sometimes on the top of the
oven, sometimes in a dark corner. She did not take part in the conversations,
but OlÃ©nin saw her eyes and face and heard her moving or cracking sunflower
seeds, and he felt that she listened with her whole being when he spoke, and
was aware of his presence while he silently read to himself. Sometimes he
thought her eyes were fixed on him, and meeting their radiance he involuntarily
became silent and gazed at her. Then she would instantly hide her face and he
would pretend to be deep in conversation with the old woman, while he listened
all the time to her breathing and to her every movement and waited for her to
look at him again. In the presence of others she was generally bright and
friendly with him, but when they were alone together she was shy and rough.
Sometimes he came in before MaryÃ¡nka had returned home. Suddenly he would hear
her firm footsteps and catch a glimmer of her blue cotton smock at the open
door. Then she would step into the middle of the hut, catch sight of him, and
her eyes would give a scarcely perceptible kindly smile, and he would feel
happy and frightened.

He neither sought for nor wished for anything from her, but every day her
presence became more and more necessary to him.

OlÃ©nin had entered into the life of the Cossack village so fully that his past
seemed quite foreign to him. As to the future, especially a future outside the
world in which he was now living, it did not interest him at all. When he
received letters from home, from relatives and friends, he was offended by the
evident distress with which they regarded him as a lost man, while he in his
village considered those as lost who did not live as he was living. He felt
sure he would never repent of having broken away from his former surroundings
and of having settled down in this village to such a solitary and original
life. When out on expeditions, and when quartered at one of the forts, he felt
happy too; but it was here, from under Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs wing, from the forest
and from his hut at the end of the village, and especially when he thought of
MaryÃ¡nka and LukÃ¡shka, that he seemed to see the falseness of his former life.
That falseness used to rouse his indignation even before, but now it seemed
inexpressibly vile and ridiculous. Here he felt freer and freer every day and
more and more of a man. The Caucasus now appeared entirely different to what
his imagination had painted it. He had found nothing at all like his dreams,
nor like the descriptions of the Caucasus he had heard and read. âThere are
none of all those chestnut steeds, precipices, Amalet Beks, heroes or
villains,â thought he. âThe people live as nature lives: they die, are born,
unite, and more are bornâthey fight, eat and drink, rejoice and die, without
any restrictions but those that nature imposes on sun and grass, on animal and
tree. They have no other laws.â Therefore these people, compared to himself,
appeared to him beautiful, strong, and free, and the sight of them made him
feel ashamed and sorry for himself. Often it seriously occurred to him to throw
up everything, to get registered as a Cossack, to buy a hut and cattle and
marry a Cossack woman (only not MaryÃ¡nka, whom he conceded to LukÃ¡shka), and to
live with Daddy ErÃ³shka and go shooting and fishing with him, and go with the
Cossacks on their expeditions. âWhy ever donât I do it? What am I waiting for?â
he asked himself, and he egged himself on and shamed himself. âAm I afraid of
doing what I hold to be reasonable and right? Is the wish to be a simple
Cossack, to live close to nature, not to injure anyone but even to do good to
others, more stupid than my former dreams, such as those of becoming a minister
of state or a colonel?â but a voice seemed to say that he should wait, and not
take any decision. He was held back by a dim consciousness that he could not
live altogether like ErÃ³shka and LukÃ¡shka because he had a different idea of
happinessâhe was held back by the thought that happiness lies in
self-sacrifice. What he had done for LukÃ¡shka continued to give him joy. He
kept looking for occasions to sacrifice himself for others, but did not meet
with them. Sometimes he forgot this newly discovered recipe for happiness and
considered himself capable of identifying his life with Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs, but
then he quickly bethought himself and promptly clutched at the idea of
conscious self-sacrifice, and from that basis looked calmly and proudly at all
men and at their happiness.

Chapter XXVII

Just before the vintage LukÃ¡shka came on horseback to see OlÃ©nin. He looked
more dashing than ever.

âWell? Are you getting married?â asked OlÃ©nin, greeting him merrily.

LukÃ¡shka gave no direct reply.

âThere, Iâve exchanged your horse across the river. This
is
a horse! A
KabardÃ¡ horse from the Lov stud. I know horses.â

They examined the new horse and made him caracole about the yard. The horse
really was an exceptionally fine one, a broad and long gelding, with glossy
coat, thick silky tail, and the soft fine mane and crest of a thoroughbred. He
was so well fed that âyou might go to sleep on his backâ as LukÃ¡shka expressed
it. His hoofs, eyes, teeth, were exquisitely shaped and sharply outlined, as
one only finds them in very pure-bred horses. OlÃ©nin could not help admiring
the horse, he had not yet met with such a beauty in the Caucasus.

âAnd how it goes!â said LukÃ¡shka, patting its neck. âWhat a step! And so
cleverâhe simply runs after his master.â

âDid you have to add much to make the exchange?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âI did not count it,â answered LukÃ¡shka with a smile. âI got him from a

kunak
.â

âA wonderfully beautiful horse! What would you take for it?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âI have been offered a hundred and fifty rubles for it, but Iâll give it you
for nothing,â said LukÃ¡shka, merrily. âOnly say the word and itâs yours. Iâll
unsaddle it and you may take it. Only give me some sort of a horse for my
duties.â

âNo, on no account.â

âWell then, here is a dagger Iâve brought you,â said LukÃ¡shka, unfastening his
girdle and taking out one of the two daggers which hung from it. âI got it from
across the river.â

âOh, thank you!â

âAnd mother has promised to bring you some grapes herself.â

âThatâs quite unnecessary. Weâll balance up some day. You see I donât offer you
any money for the dagger!â

âHow could you? We are
kunaks
. Itâs just the same as when GirÃ©y Khan
across the river took me into his home and said, âChoose what you like!â So I
took this sword. Itâs our custom.â

They went into the hut and had a drink.

âAre you staying here awhile?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âNo, I have come to say good-bye. They are sending me from the cordon to a
company beyond the TÃ©rek. I am going tonight with my comrade NazÃ¡rka.â

âAnd when is the wedding to be?â

âI shall be coming back for the betrothal, and then I shall return to the
company again,â LukÃ¡shka replied reluctantly.

âWhat, and see nothing of your betrothed?â

âJust soâwhat is the good of looking at her? When you go on campaign ask in our
company for LukÃ¡shka the Broad. But what a lot of boars there are in our parts!
Iâve killed two. Iâll take you.â

âWell, good-bye! Christ save you.â

LukÃ¡shka mounted his horse, and without calling on MaryÃ¡nka, rode caracoling
down the street, where NazÃ¡rka was already awaiting him.

âI say, shanât we call round?â asked NazÃ¡rka, winking in the direction of
YÃ¡mkaâs house.

âThatâs a good one!â said LukÃ¡shka. âHere, take my horse to her and if I donât
come soon give him some hay. I shall reach the company by the morning anyway.â

âHasnât the cadet given you anything more?â

âI am thankful to have paid him back with a daggerâhe was going to ask for the
horse,â said LukÃ¡shka, dismounting and handing over the horse to NazÃ¡rka.

He darted into the yard past OlÃ©ninâs very window, and came up to the window of
the cornetâs hut. It was already quite dark. MaryÃ¡nka, wearing only her smock,
was combing her hair preparing for bed.

âItâs Iââ whispered the Cossack.

MaryÃ¡nkaâs look was severely indifferent, but her face suddenly brightened up
when she heard her name. She opened the window and leant out, frightened and
joyous.

âWhatâwhat do you want?â she said.

âOpen!â uttered LukÃ¡shka. âLet me in for a minute. I am so sick of waiting!
Itâs awful!â

He took hold of her head through the window and kissed her.

âReally, do open!â

âWhy do you talk nonsense? Iâve told you I wonât! Have you come for long?â

He did not answer but went on kissing her, and she did not ask again.

âThere, through the window one canât even hug you properly,â said LukÃ¡shka.

âMaryÃ¡nka dear!â came the voice of her mother, âwho is that with you?â

LukÃ¡shka took off his cap, which might have been seen, and crouched down by the
window.

âGo, be quick!â whispered MaryÃ¡nka.

âLukÃ¡shka called round,â she answered; âhe was asking for Daddy.â

âWell then send him here!â

âHeâs gone; said he was in a hurry.â

In fact, LukÃ¡shka, stooping, as with big strides he passed under the windows,
ran out through the yard and towards YÃ¡mkaâs house unseen by anyone but OlÃ©nin.
After drinking two bowls of
chikhir
he and NazÃ¡rka rode away to the
outpost. The night was warm, dark, and calm. They rode in silence, only the
footfall of their horses was heard. LukÃ¡shka started a song about the Cossack,
MingÃ¡l, but stopped before he had finished the first verse, and after a pause,
turning to NazÃ¡rka, said:

âI say, she wouldnât let me in!â

âOh?â rejoined NazÃ¡rka. âI knew she wouldnât. Dâyou know what YÃ¡mka told me?
The cadet has begun going to their house. Daddy ErÃ³shka brags that he got a gun
from the cadet for getting him MaryÃ¡nka.â

âHe lies, the old devil!â said LukÃ¡shka, angrily. âSheâs not such a girl. If he
does not look out Iâll wallop that old devilâs sides,â and he began his
favourite song:

âFrom the village of IzmÃ¡ylov,

From the masterâs favourite garden,

Once escaped a keen-eyed falcon.

Soon after him a huntsman came a-riding,

And he beckoned to the falcon that had strayed,

But the bright-eyed bird thus answered:

âIn gold cage you could not keep me,

On your hand you could not hold me,

So now I fly to blue seas far away.

There a white swan I will kill,

Of sweet swan-flesh have my fill.ââ

Chapter XXVIII

The betrothal was taking place in the cornetâs hut. LukÃ¡shka had returned to
the village, but had not been to see OlÃ©nin, and OlÃ©nin had not gone to the
betrothal though he had been invited. He was sad as he had never been since he
settled in this Cossack village. He had seen LukÃ¡shka earlier in the evening
and was worried by the question why LukÃ¡shka was so cold towards him. OlÃ©nin
shut himself up in his hut and began writing in his diary as follows:

âMany things have I pondered over lately and much have I changed,â wrote he,
âand I have come back to the copybook maxim: The one way to be happy is to
love, to love self-denyingly, to love everybody and everything; to spread a web
of love on all sides and to take all who come into it. In this way I caught
VanyÃºsha, Daddy ErÃ³shka, LukÃ¡shka, and MaryÃ¡nka.â

As OlÃ©nin was finishing this sentence Daddy ErÃ³shka entered the room.

ErÃ³shka was in the happiest frame of mind. A few evenings before this, OlÃ©nin
had gone to see him and had found him with a proud and happy face deftly
skinning the carcass of a boar with a small knife in the yard. The dogs (Lyam
his pet among them) were lying close by watching what he was doing and gently
wagging their tails. The little boys were respectfully looking at him through
the fence and not even teasing him as was their wont. His women neighbours, who
were as a rule not too gracious towards him, greeted him and brought him, one a
jug of
chikhir
, another some clotted cream, and a third a little flour.
The next day ErÃ³shka sat in his store-room all covered with blood, and
distributed pounds of boar-flesh, taking in payment money from some and wine
from others. His face clearly expressed, âGod has sent me luck. I have killed a
boar, so now I am wanted.â Consequently, he naturally began to drink, and had
gone on for four days never leaving the village. Besides which he had had
something to drink at the betrothal.

He came to OlÃ©nin quite drunk: his face red, his beard tangled, but wearing a
new
beshmet
trimmed with gold braid; and he brought with him a

balalÃ¡yka
which he had obtained beyond the river. He had long promised
OlÃ©nin this treat, and felt in the mood for it, so that he was sorry to find
OlÃ©nin writing.

âWrite on, write on, my lad,â he whispered, as if he thought that a spirit sat
between him and the paper and must not be frightened away, and he softly and
silently sat down on the floor. When Daddy ErÃ³shka was drunk his favourite
position was on the floor. OlÃ©nin looked round, ordered some wine to be
brought, and continued to write. ErÃ³shka found it dull to drink by himself and
he wished to talk.

âIâve been to the betrothal at the cornetâs. But there! Theyâre shwine!âDonât
want them!âHave come to you.â

âAnd where did you get your
balalÃ¡yka?
â asked OlÃ©nin, still writing.

âIâve been beyond the river and got it there, brother mine,â he answered, also
very quietly. âIâm a master at it. Tartar or Cossack, squire or soldiersâ
songs, any kind you please.â

OlÃ©nin looked at him again, smiled, and went on writing.

That smile emboldened the old man.

âCome, leave off, my lad, leave off!â he said with sudden firmness.

âWell, perhaps I will.â

âCome, people have injured you but leave them alone, spit at them! Come, whatâs
the use of writing and writing, whatâs the good?â

And he tried to mimic OlÃ©nin by tapping the floor with his thick fingers, and
then twisted his big face to express contempt.

âWhatâs the good of writing quibbles. Better have a spree and show youâre a
man!â

No other conception of writing found place in his head except that of legal
chicanery.

OlÃ©nin burst out laughing and so did ErÃ³shka. Then, jumping up from the floor,
the latter began to show off his skill on the
balalÃ¡yka
and to sing
Tartar songs.

âWhy write, my good fellow! Youâd better listen to what Iâll sing to you. When
youâre dead you wonât hear any more songs. Make merry now!â

First he sang a song of his own composing accompanied by a dance:

âAh, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,

Say where did they last see him?

In a booth, at the fair,

He was selling pins, there.â

Then he sang a song he had learnt from his former sergeant-major:

âDeep I fell in love on Monday,

Tuesday nothing did but sigh,

Wednesday I popped the question,

Thursday waited her reply.

Friday, late, it came at last,

Then all hope for me was past!

Saturday my life to take

I determined like a man,

But for my salvationâs sake

Sunday morning changed my plan!â

Then he sang again:

âOh dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,

Say where did they last see him?â

And after that, winking, twitching his shoulders, and footing it to the tune,
he sang:

âI will kiss you and embrace,

Ribbons red twine round you;

And Iâll call you little Grace.

Oh, you little Grace now do

Tell me, do you love me true?â

And he became so excited that with a sudden dashing movement he started dancing
around the room accompanying himself the while.

Songs like âDee, dee, deeâââgentlemenâs songsââhe sang for OlÃ©ninâs benefit,
but after drinking three more tumblers of
chikhir
he remembered old
times and began singing real Cossack and Tartar songs. In the midst of one of
his favourite songs his voice suddenly trembled and he ceased singing, and only
continued strumming on the
balalÃ¡yka
.

âOh, my dear friend!â he said.

The peculiar sound of his voice made OlÃ©nin look round.

The old man was weeping. Tears stood in his eyes and one tear was running down
his cheek.

âYou are gone, my young days, and will never come back!â he said, blubbering
and halting. âDrink, why donât you drink!â he suddenly shouted with a deafening
roar, without wiping away his tears.

There was one Tartar song that specially moved him. It had few words, but its
charm lay in the sad refrain. âAy day, dalalay!â ErÃ³shka translated the words
of the song: âA youth drove his sheep from the
aoul
to the mountains:
the Russians came and burnt the
aoul
, they killed all the men and took
all the women into bondage. The youth returned from the mountains. Where the

aoul
had stood was an empty space; his mother not there, nor his
brothers, nor his house; one tree alone was left standing. The youth sat
beneath the tree and wept. âAlone like thee, alone am I left,ââ and ErÃ³shka
began singing: âAy day, dalalay!â and the old man repeated several times this
wailing, heart-rending refrain.

When he had finished the refrain ErÃ³shka suddenly seized a gun that hung on the
wall, rushed hurriedly out into the yard and fired off both barrels into the
air. Then again he began, more dolefully, his âAy day, dalalayâah, ah,â and
ceased.

OlÃ©nin followed him into the porch and looked up into the starry sky in the
direction where the shots had flashed. In the cornetâs house there were lights
and the sound of voices. In the yard girls were crowding round the porch and
the windows, and running backwards and forwards between the hut and the
outhouse. Some Cossacks rushed out of the hut and could not refrain from
shouting, re-echoing the refrain of Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs song and his shots.

âWhy are you not at the betrothal?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âNever mind them! Never mind them!â muttered the old man, who had evidently
been offended by something there. âDonât like them, I donât. Oh, those people!
Come back into the hut! Let them make merry by themselves and weâll make merry
by ourselves.â

OlÃ©nin went in.

âAnd LukÃ¡shka, is he happy? Wonât he come to see me?â he asked.

âWhat, LukÃ¡shka? Theyâve lied to him and said I am getting his girl for you,â
whispered the old man. âBut whatâs the girl? She will be ours if we want her.
Give enough moneyâand sheâs ours. Iâll fix it up for you. Really!â

âNo, Daddy, money can do nothing if she does not love me. Youâd better not talk
like that!â

âWe are not loved, you and I. We are forlorn,â said Daddy ErÃ³shka suddenly, and
again he began to cry.

Listening to the old manâs talk OlÃ©nin had drunk more than usual. âSo now my
LukÃ¡shka is happy,â thought he; yet he felt sad. The old man had drunk so much
that evening that he fell down on the floor and VanyÃºsha had to call soldiers
in to help, and spat as they dragged the old man out. He was so angry with the
old man for his bad behaviour that he did not even say a single French word.

Chapter XXIX

It was August. For days the sky had been cloudless, the sun scorched unbearably
and from early morning the warm wind raised a whirl of hot sand from the
sand-drifts and from the road, and bore it in the air through the reeds, the
trees, and the village. The grass and the leaves on the trees were covered with
dust, the roads and dried-up salt marshes were baked so hard that they rang
when trodden on. The water had long since subsided in the TÃ©rek and rapidly
vanished and dried up in the ditches. The slimy banks of the pond near the
village were trodden bare by the cattle and all day long you could hear the
splashing of water and the shouting of girls and boys bathing. The sand-drifts
and the reeds were already drying up in the steppes, and the cattle, lowing,
ran into the fields in the day-time. The boars migrated into the distant
reed-beds and to the hills beyond the TÃ©rek. Mosquitoes and gnats swarmed in
thick clouds over the low lands and villages. The snow-peaks were hidden in
grey mist. The air was rarefied and smoky. It was said that
abreks
had
crossed the now shallow river and were prowling on this side of it. Every night
the sun set in a glowing red blaze. It was the busiest time of the year. The
villagers all swarmed in the melon-fields and the vineyards. The vineyards
thickly overgrown with twining verdure lay in cool, deep shade. Everywhere
between the broad translucent leaves, ripe, heavy, black clusters peeped out.
Along the dusty road from the vineyards the creaking carts moved slowly, heaped
up with black grapes. Clusters of them, crushed by the wheels, lay in the dirt.
Boys and girls in smocks stained with grape-juice, with grapes in their hands
and mouths, ran after their mothers. On the road you continually came across
tattered labourers with baskets of grapes on their powerful shoulders; Cossack
maidens, veiled with kerchiefs to their eyes, drove bullocks harnessed to carts
laden high with grapes. Soldiers who happened to meet these carts asked for
grapes, and the maidens, clambering up without stopping their carts, would take
an armful of grapes and drop them into the skirts of the soldiersâ coats. In
some homesteads they had already begun pressing the grapes; and the smell of
the emptied skins filled the air. One saw the blood-red troughs in the
pent-houses in the yards and NogÃ¡y labourers with their trousers rolled up and
their legs stained with the juice. Grunting pigs gorged themselves with the
empty skins and rolled about in them. The flat roofs of the outhouses were all
spread over with the dark amber clusters drying in the sun. Daws and magpies
crowded round the roofs, picking the seeds and fluttering from one place to
another.

The fruits of the yearâs labour were being merrily gathered in, and this year
the fruit was unusually fine and plentiful.

In the shady green vineyards amid a sea of vines, laughter, songs, merriment,
and the voices of women were to be heard on all sides, and glimpses of their
bright-coloured garments could be seen.

Just at noon MaryÃ¡nka was sitting in their vineyard in the shade of a
peach-tree, getting out the family dinner from under an unharnessed cart.
Opposite her, on a spread-out horse-cloth, sat the cornet (who had returned
from the school) washing his hands by pouring water on them from a little jug.
Her little brother, who had just come straight out of the pond, stood wiping
his face with his wide sleeves, and gazed anxiously at his sister and his
mother and breathed deeply, awaiting his dinner. The old mother, with her
sleeves rolled up over her strong sunburnt arms, was arranging grapes, dried
fish, and clotted cream on a little low, circular Tartar table. The cornet
wiped his hands, took off his cap, crossed himself, and moved nearer to the
table. The boy seized the jug and eagerly began to drink. The mother and
daughter crossed their legs under them and sat down by the table. Even in the
shade it was intolerably hot. The air above the vineyard smelt unpleasant: the
strong warm wind passing amid the branches brought no coolness, but only
monotonously bent the tops of the pear, peach, and mulberry trees with which
the vineyard was sprinkled. The cornet, having crossed himself once more, took
a little jug of
chikhir
that stood behind him covered with a vine-leaf,
and having had a drink from the mouth of the jug passed it to the old woman. He
had nothing on over his shirt, which was unfastened at the neck and showed his
shaggy muscular chest. His fine-featured cunning face looked cheerful; neither
in his attitude nor in his words was his usual wiliness to be seen; he was
cheerful and natural.

âShall we finish the bit beyond the shed tonight?â he asked, wiping his wet
beard.

âWeâll manage it,â replied his wife, âif only the weather does not hinder us.
The DÃ«mkins have not half finished yet,â she added. âOnly Ãstenka is at work
there, wearing herself out.â

âWhat can you expect of them?â said the old man proudly.

âHere, have a drink, MaryÃ¡nka dear!â said the old woman, passing the jug to the
girl. âGod willing weâll have enough to pay for the wedding feast,â she added.

âThatâs not yet awhile,â said the cornet with a slight frown.

The girl hung her head.

âWhy shouldnât we mention it?â said the old woman. âThe affair is settled, and
the time is drawing near too.â

âDonât make plans beforehand,â said the cornet. âNow we have the harvest to get
in.â

âHave you seen LukÃ¡shkaâs new horse?â asked the old woman. âThat which DmÃ­tri
AndrÃ©ich OlÃ©nin gave him is gone â heâs exchanged it.â

âNo, I have not; but I spoke with the servant today,â said the cornet, âand he
said his master has again received a thousand rubles.â

âRolling in riches, in short,â said the old woman.

The whole family felt cheerful and contented.

The work was progressing successfully. The grapes were more abundant and finer
than they had expected. After dinner MaryÃ¡nka threw some grass to the oxen,
folded her
beshmet
for a pillow, and lay down under the wagon on the
juicy down-trodden grass. She had on only a red kerchief over her head and a
faded blue print smock, yet she felt unbearably hot. Her face was burning, and
she did not know where to put her feet, her eyes were moist with sleepiness and
weariness, her lips parted involuntarily, and her chest heaved heavily and
deeply.

The busy time of year had begun a fortnight ago and the continuous heavy labour
had filled the girlâs life. At dawn she jumped up, washed her face with cold
water, wrapped herself in a shawl, and ran out barefoot to see to the cattle.
Then she hurriedly put on her shoes and her
beshmet
and, taking a small
bundle of bread, she harnessed the bullocks and drove away to the vineyards for
the whole day. There she cut the grapes and carried the baskets with only an
hourâs interval for rest, and in the evening she returned to the village,
bright and not tired, dragging the bullocks by a rope or driving them with a
long stick. After attending to the cattle, she took some sunflower seeds in the
wide sleeve of her smock and went to the corner of the street to crack them and
have some fun with the other girls. But as soon as it was dusk she returned
home, and after having supper with her parents and her brother in the dark
outhouse, she went into the hut, healthy and free from care, and climbed onto
the oven, where half drowsing she listened to their lodgerâs conversation. As
soon as he went away she would throw herself down on her bed and sleep soundly
and quietly till morning. And so it went on day after day. She had not seen
LukÃ¡shka since the day of their betrothal, but calmly awaited the wedding. She
had got used to their lodger and felt his intent looks with pleasure.

Chapter XXX

Although there was no escape from the heat and the mosquitoes swarmed in the
cool shadow of the wagons, and her little brother tossing about beside her kept
pushing her, MaryÃ¡nka having drawn her kerchief over her head was just falling
asleep, when suddenly their neighbour Ãstenka came running towards her and,
diving under the wagon, lay down beside her.

âSleep, girls, sleep!â said Ãstenka, making herself comfortable under the
wagon. âWait a bit,â she exclaimed, âthis wonât do!â

She jumped up, plucked some green branches, and stuck them through the wheels
on both sides of the wagon and hung her
beshmet
over them.

âLet me in,â she shouted to the little boy as she again crept under the wagon.
âIs this the place for a Cossackâwith the girls? Go away!â

When alone under the wagon with her friend, Ãstenka suddenly put both her arms
round her, and clinging close to her began kissing her cheeks and neck.

âDarling, sweetheart,â she kept repeating, between bursts of shrill, clear
laughter.

âWhy, youâve learnt it from Grandad,â said MaryÃ¡nka, struggling. âStop it!â

And they both broke into such peals of laughter that MaryÃ¡nkaâs mother shouted
to them to be quiet.

âAre you jealous?â asked Ãstenka in a whisper.

âWhat humbug! Let me sleep. What have you come for?â

But Ãstenka kept on, âI say! But I wanted to tell you such a thing.â

MaryÃ¡nka raised herself on her elbow and arranged the kerchief which had
slipped off.

âWell, what is it?â

âI know something about your lodger!â

âThereâs nothing to know,â said MaryÃ¡nka.

âOh, you rogue of a girl!â said Ãstenka, nudging her with her elbow and
laughing. âWonât tell anything. Does he come to you?â

âHe does. What of that?â said MaryÃ¡nka with a sudden blush.

âNow Iâm a simple lass. I tell everybody. Why should I pretend?â said Ãstenka,
and her bright rosy face suddenly became pensive. âWhom do I hurt? I love him,
thatâs all about it.â

âGrandad, do you mean?â

âWell, yes!â

âAnd the sin?â

âAh, MaryÃ¡nka! When is one to have a good time if not while oneâs still free?
When I marry a Cossack I shall bear children and shall have cares. There now,
when you get married to LukÃ¡shka not even a thought of joy will enter your
head: children will come, and work!â

âWell? Some who are married live happily. It makes no difference!â MaryÃ¡nka
replied quietly.

âDo tell me just this once what has passed between you and LukÃ¡shka?â

âWhat has passed? A match was proposed. Father put it off for a year, but now
itâs been settled and theyâll marry us in autumn.â

âBut what did he say to you?â

MaryÃ¡nka smiled.

âWhat should he say? He said he loved me. He kept asking me to come to the
vineyards with him.â

âJust see what pitch! But you didnât go, did you? And what a dare-devil he has
become: the first among the braves. He makes merry out there in the army too!
The other day our KÃ­rka came home; he says: âWhat a horse LukÃ¡shkaâs got in
exchange!â But all the same I expect he frets after you. And what else did he
say?â

âMust you know everything?â said MaryÃ¡nka laughing. âOne night he came to my
window tipsy, and asked me to let him in.â

âAnd you didnât let him?â

âLet him, indeed! Once I have said a thing I keep to it firm as a rock,â
answered MaryÃ¡nka seriously.

âA fine fellow! If he wanted her, no girl would refuse him.â

âWell, let him go to the others,â replied MaryÃ¡nka proudly.

âYou donât pity him?â

âI do pity him, but Iâll have no nonsense. It is wrong.â

Ãstenka suddenly dropped her head on her friendâs breast, seized hold of her,
and shook with smothered laughter. âYou silly fool!â she exclaimed, quite out
of breath. âYou donât want to be happy,â and she began tickling MaryÃ¡nka.

âOh, leave off!â said MaryÃ¡nka, screaming and laughing. âYouâve crushed
LazÃºtka.â

âHark at those young devils! Quite frisky! Not tired yet!â came the old womanâs
sleepy voice from the wagon.

âDonât want happiness,â repeated Ãstenka in a whisper, insistently. âBut you
are lucky, that you are! How they love you! You are so crusty, and yet they
love you. Ah, if I were in your place Iâd soon turn the lodgerâs head! I
noticed him when you were at our house. He was ready to eat you with his eyes.
What things Grandad has given me! And yours they say is the richest of the
Russians. His orderly says they have serfs of their own.â

MaryÃ¡nka raised herself, and after thinking a moment, smiled.

âDo you know what he once told me: the lodger I mean?â she said, biting a bit
of grass. âHe said, âIâd like to be LukÃ¡shka the Cossack, or your brother
LazÃºtkaâ.â What do you think he meant?â

âOh, just chattering what came into his head,â answered Ãstenka. âWhat does
mine not say! Just as if he was possessed!â

MaryÃ¡nka dropped her hand on her folded
beshmet
, threw her arm over
Ãstenkaâs shoulder, and shut her eyes.

âHe wanted to come and work in the vineyard today: father invited him,â she
said, and after a short silence she fell asleep.

Chapter XXXI

The sun had come out from behind the pear-tree that had shaded the wagon, and
even through the branches that Ãstenka had fixed up it scorched the faces of
the sleeping girls. MaryÃ¡nka woke up and began arranging the kerchief on her
head. Looking about her, beyond the pear-tree she noticed their lodger, who
with his gun on his shoulder stood talking to her father. She nudged Ãstenka
and smilingly pointed him out to her.

âI went yesterday and didnât find a single one,â OlÃ©nin was saying as he looked
about uneasily, not seeing MaryÃ¡nka through the branches.

âAh, you should go out there in that direction, go right as by compasses, there
in a disused vineyard denominated as the Waste, hares are always to be found,â
said the cornet, having at once changed his manner of speech.

âA fine thing to go looking for hares in these busy times! You had better come
and help us, and do some work with the girls,â the old woman said merrily. âNow
then, girls, up with you!â she cried.

MaryÃ¡nka and Ãstenka under the cart were whispering and could hardly restrain
their laughter.

Since it had become known that OlÃ©nin had given a horse worth fifty rubles to
LukÃ¡shka, his hosts had become more amiable and the cornet in particular saw
with pleasure his daughterâs growing intimacy with OlÃ©nin.

âBut I donât know how to do the work,â replied OlÃ©nin, trying not to look
through the green branches under the wagon where he had now noticed MaryÃ¡nkaâs
blue smock and red kerchief.

âCome, Iâll give you some peaches,â said the old woman.

âItâs only according to the ancient Cossack hospitality. Itâs her old womanâs
silliness,â said the cornet, explaining and apparently correcting his wifeâs
words. âIn Russia, I expect, itâs not so much peaches as pineapple jam and
preserves you have been accustomed to eat at your pleasure.â

âSo you say hares are to be found in the disused vineyard?â asked OlÃ©nin. âI
will go there,â and throwing a hasty glance through the green branches he
raised his cap and disappeared between the regular rows of green vines.

The sun had already sunk behind the fence of the vineyards, and its broken rays
glittered through the translucent leaves when OlÃ©nin returned to his hostâs
vineyard. The wind was falling and a cool freshness was beginning to spread
around. By some instinct OlÃ©nin recognized from afar MaryÃ¡nkaâs blue smock
among the rows of vine, and, picking grapes on his way, he approached her. His
highly excited dog also now and then seized a low-hanging cluster of grapes in
his slobbering mouth. MaryÃ¡nka, her face flushed, her sleeves rolled up, and
her kerchief down below her chin, was rapidly cutting the heavy clusters and
laying them in a basket. Without letting go of the vine she had hold of, she
stopped to smile pleasantly at him and resumed her work. OlÃ©nin drew near and
threw his gun behind his back to have his hands free. âWhere are your people?
May God aid you! Are you alone?â he meant to say but did not say, and only
raised his cap in silence.

He was ill at ease alone with MaryÃ¡nka, but as if purposely to torment himself
he went up to her.

âYouâll be shooting the women with your gun like that,â said MaryÃ¡nka.

âNo, I shanât shoot them.â

They were both silent.

Then after a pause she said: âYou should help me.â

He took out his knife and began silently to cut off the clusters. He reached
from under the leaves low down a thick bunch weighing about three pounds, the
grapes of which grew so close that they flattened each other for want of space.
He showed it to MaryÃ¡nka.

âMust they all be cut? Isnât this one too green?â

âGive it here.â

Their hands touched. OlÃ©nin took her hand, and she looked at him smiling.

âAre you going to be married soon?â he asked.

She did not answer, but turned away with a stern look.

âDo you love LukÃ¡shka?â

âWhatâs that to you?â

âI envy him!â

âVery likely!â

âNo really. You are so beautiful!â

And he suddenly felt terribly ashamed of having said it, so commonplace did the
words seem to him. He flushed, lost control of himself, and seized both her
hands.

âWhatever I am, Iâm not for you. Why do you make fun of me?â replied MaryÃ¡nka,
but her look showed how certainly she knew he was not making fun.

âMaking fun? If you only knew how Iââ

The words sounded still more commonplace, they accorded still less with what he
felt, but yet he continued, âI donât know what I would not do for youââ

âLeave me alone, you pitch!â

But her face, her shining eyes, her swelling bosom, her shapely legs, said
something quite different. It seemed to him that she understood how petty were
all things he had said, but that she was superior to such considerations. It
seemed to him she had long known all he wished and was not able to tell her,
but wanted to hear how he would say it. âAnd how can she help knowing,â he
thought, âsince I only want to tell her all that she herself is? But she does
not wish to understand, does not wish to reply.â

âHullo!â suddenly came Ãstenkaâs high voice from behind the vine at no great
distance, followed by her shrill laugh. âCome and help me, DmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich. I
am all alone,â she cried, thrusting her round, naÃ¯ve little face through the
vines.

OlÃ©nin did not answer nor move from his place.

MaryÃ¡nka went on cutting and continually looked up at OlÃ©nin. He was about to
say something, but stopped, shrugged his shoulders and, having jerked up his
gun, walked out of the vineyard with rapid strides.

Chapter XXXII

He stopped once or twice, listening to the ringing laughter of MaryÃ¡nka and
Ãstenka who, having come together, were shouting something. OlÃ©nin spent the
whole evening hunting in the forest and returned home at dusk without having
killed anything. When crossing the road he noticed her open the door of the
outhouse, and her blue smock showed through it. He called to VanyÃºsha very loud
so as to let her know that he was back, and then sat down in the porch in his
usual place. His hosts now returned from the vineyard; they came out of the
outhouse and into their hut, but did not ask him in. MaryÃ¡nka went twice out of
the gate. Once in the twilight it seemed to him that she was looking at him. He
eagerly followed her every movement, but could not make up his mind to approach
her. When she disappeared into the hut he left the porch and began pacing up
and down the yard, but MaryÃ¡nka did not come out again. OlÃ©nin spent the whole
sleepless night out in the yard listening to every sound in his hostsâ hut. He
heard them talking early in the evening, heard them having their supper and
pulling out their cushions, and going to bed; he heard MaryÃ¡nka laughing at
something, and then heard everything growing gradually quiet.

The cornet and his wife talked a while in whispers, and someone was breathing.
OlÃ©nin re-entered his hut. VanyÃºsha lay asleep in his clothes. OlÃ©nin envied
him, and again went out to pace the yard, always expecting something, but no
one came, no one moved, and he only heard the regular breathing of three
people. He knew MaryÃ¡nkaâs breathing and listened to it and to the beating of
his own heart. In the village everything was quiet. The waning moon rose late,
and the deep-breathing cattle in the yard became more visible as they lay down
and slowly rose. OlÃ©nin angrily asked himself, âWhat is it I want?â but could
not tear himself away from the enchantment of the night. Suddenly he thought he
distinctly heard the floor creak and the sound of footsteps in his hostsâ hut.
He rushed to the door, but all was silent again except for the sound of regular
breathing, and in the yard the buffalo-cow, after a deep sigh, again moved,
rose on her foreknees and then on her feet, swished her tail, and something
splashed steadily on the dry clay ground; then she lay down again in the dim
moonlight. He asked himself: âWhat am I to do?â and definitely decided to go to
bed, but again he heard a sound, and in his imagination there arose the image
of MaryÃ¡nka coming out into this moonlit misty night, and again he rushed to
her window and again heard the sound of footsteps. Not till just before dawn
did he go up to her window and push at the shutter and then run to the door,
and this time he really heard MaryÃ¡nkaâs deep breathing and her footsteps. He
took hold of the latch and knocked. The floor hardly creaked under the bare
cautious footsteps which approached the door. The latch clicked, the door
creaked, and he noticed a faint smell of marjoram and pumpkin, and MaryÃ¡nkaâs
whole figure appeared in the doorway. He saw her only for an instant in the
moonlight. She slammed the door and, muttering something, ran lightly back
again. OlÃ©nin began rapping softly but nothing responded. He ran to the window
and listened. Suddenly he was startled by a shrill, squeaky manâs voice.

âFine!â exclaimed a rather small young Cossack in a white cap, coming across
the yard close to OlÃ©nin. âI saw ... fine!â

OlÃ©nin recognized NazÃ¡rka, and was silent, not knowing what to do or say.

âFine! Iâll go and tell them at the office, and Iâll tell her father! Thatâs a
fine cornetâs daughter! Oneâs not enough for her.â

âWhat do you want of me, what are you after?â uttered OlÃ©nin.

âNothing; only Iâll tell them at the office.â

NazÃ¡rka spoke very loud, and evidently did so intentionally, adding: âJust see
what a clever cadet!â

OlÃ©nin trembled and grew pale.

âCome here, here!â He seized the Cossack firmly by the arm and drew him towards
his hut.

âNothing happened, she did not let me in, and I too mean no harm. She is an
honest girlââ

âEh, discussââ

âYes, but all the same Iâll give you something now. Wait a bit!â

NazÃ¡rka said nothing. OlÃ©nin ran into his hut and brought out ten rubles, which
he gave to the Cossack.

âNothing happened, but still I was to blame, so I give this!âOnly for Godâs
sake donât let anyone know, for nothing happened...â

âI wish you joy,â said NazÃ¡rka laughing, and went away.

NazÃ¡rka had come to the village that night at LukÃ¡shkaâs bidding to find a
place to hide a stolen horse, and now, passing by on his way home, had heard
the sound of footsteps. When he returned next morning to his company he bragged
to his chum, and told him how cleverly he had got ten rubles. Next morning
OlÃ©nin met his hosts and they knew nothing about the events of the night. He
did not speak to MaryÃ¡nka, and she only laughed a little when she looked at
him. Next night he also passed without sleep, vainly wandering about the yard.
The day after he purposely spent shooting, and in the evening he went to see
BelÃ©tski to escape from his own thoughts. He was afraid of himself, and
promised himself not to go to his hostsâ hut any more.

That night he was roused by the sergeant-major. His company was ordered to
start at once on a raid. OlÃ©nin was glad this had happened, and thought he
would not again return to the village.

The raid lasted four days. The commander, who was a relative of OlÃ©ninâs,
wished to see him and offered to let him remain with the staff, but this OlÃ©nin
declined. He found that he could not live away from the village, and asked to
be allowed to return to it. For having taken part in the raid he received a
soldierâs cross, which he had formerly greatly desired. Now he was quite
indifferent about it, and even more indifferent about his promotion, the order
for which had still not arrived. Accompanied by VanyÃºsha he rode back to the
cordon without any accident several hours in advance of the rest of the
company. He spent the whole evening in his porch watching MaryÃ¡nka, and he
again walked about the yard, without aim or thought, all night.

Chapter XXXIII

It was late when he awoke the next day. His hosts were no longer in. He did not
go shooting, but now took up a book, and now went out into the porch, and now
again re-entered the hut and lay down on the bed. VanyÃºsha thought he was ill.

Towards evening OlÃ©nin got up, resolutely began writing, and wrote on till late
at night. He wrote a letter, but did not post it because he felt that no one
would have understood what he wanted to say, and besides it was not necessary
that anyone but himself should understand it.

This is what he wrote:

âI receive letters of condolence from Russia. They are afraid that I shall
perish, buried in these wilds. They say about me: âHe will become coarse; he
will be behind the times in everything; he will take to drink, and who knows
but that he may marry a Cossack girl.â It was not for nothing, they say, that
ErmÃ³lov declared: âAnyone serving in the Caucasus for ten years either becomes
a confirmed drunkard or marries a loose woman.â How terrible! Indeed it wonât
do for me to ruin myself when I might have the great happiness of even becoming
the Countess Bâââs husband, or a Court chamberlain, or a
MarÃ©chal de
noblesse
of my district. Oh, how repulsive and pitiable you all seem to me!
You do not know what happiness is and what life is! One must taste life once in
all its natural beauty, must see and understand what I see every day before
meâthose eternally unapproachable snowy peaks, and a majestic woman in that
primitive beauty in which the first woman must have come from her creatorâs
handsâand then it becomes clear who is ruining himself and who is living truly
or falselyâyou or I. If you only knew how despicable and pitiable you, in your
delusions, seem to me! When I picture to myselfâin place of my hut, my forests,
and my loveâthose drawing-rooms, those women with their pomatum-greased hair
eked out with false curls, those unnaturally grimacing lips, those hidden,
feeble, distorted limbs, and that chatter of obligatory drawing-room
conversation which has no right to the nameâI feel unendurably revolted. I then
see before me those obtuse faces, those rich eligible girls whose looks seem to
say: âItâs all right, you may come near though I am rich and eligibleââand that
arranging and rearranging of seats, that shameless match-making and that
eternal tittle-tattle and pretence; those rulesâwith whom to shake hands, to
whom only to nod, with whom to converse (and all this done deliberately with a
conviction of its inevitability), that continual ennui in the blood passing on
from generation to generation. Try to understand or believe just this one
thing: you need only see and comprehend what truth and beauty are, and all that
you now say and think and all your wishes for me and for yourselves will fly to
atoms!

âHappiness is being with nature, seeing her, and conversing with her. âHe
may even (God forbid) marry a common Cossack girl, and be quite lost sociallyâ
I can imagine them saying of me with sincere pity! Yet the one thing I desire
is to be quite âlostâ in your sense of the word. I wish to marry a Cossack
girl, and dare not because it would be a height of happiness of which I am
unworthy.

âThree months have passed since I first saw the Cossack girl, MaryÃ¡nka. The
views and prejudices of the world I had left were still fresh in me. I did not
then believe that I could love that woman. I delighted in her beauty just as I
delighted in the beauty of the mountains and the sky, nor could I help
delighting in her, for she is as beautiful as they. I found that the sight of
her beauty had become a necessity of my life and I began asking myself whether
I did not love her. But I could find nothing within myself at all like love as
I had imagined it to be. Mine was not the restlessness of loneliness and desire
for marriage, nor was it platonic, still less a carnal love such as I have
experienced. I needed only to see her, to hear her, to know that she was
nearâand if I was not happy, I was at peace.

âAfter an evening gathering at which I met her and touched her, I felt that
between that woman and myself there existed an indissoluble though
unacknowledged bond against which I could not struggle, yet I did struggle. I
asked myself: âIs it possible to love a woman who will never understand the
profoundest interests of my life? Is it possible to love a woman simply for her
beauty, to love the statue of a woman?â But I was already in love with her,
though I did not yet trust to my feelings.

âAfter that evening when I first spoke to her our relations changed. Before
that she had been to me an extraneous but majestic object of external nature:
but since then she has become a human being. I began to meet her, to talk to
her, and sometimes to go to work for her father and to spend whole evenings
with them, and in this intimate intercourse she remained still in my eyes just
as pure, inaccessible, and majestic. She always responded with equal calm,
pride, and cheerful equanimity. Sometimes she was friendly, but generally her
every look, every word, and every movement expressed equanimityânot
contemptuous, but crushing and bewitching. Every day with a feigned smile on my
lips I tried to play a part, and with torments of passion and desire in my
heart I spoke banteringly to her. She saw that I was dissembling, but looked
straight at me cheerfully and simply. This position became unbearable. I wished
not to deceive her but to tell her all I thought and felt. I was extremely
agitated. We were in the vineyard when I began to tell her of my love, in words
I am now ashamed to remember. I am ashamed because I ought not to have dared to
speak so to her because she stood far above such words and above the feeling
they were meant to express. I said no more, but from that day my position has
been intolerable. I did not wish to demean myself by continuing our former
flippant relations, and at the same time I felt that I had not yet reached the
level of straight and simple relations with her. I asked myself despairingly,
âWhat am I to do?â In foolish dreams I imagined her now as my mistress and now
as my wife, but rejected both ideas with disgust. To make her a wanton woman
would be dreadful. It would be murder. To turn her into a fine lady, the wife
of DmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich OlÃ©nin, like a Cossack woman here who is married to one of
our officers, would be still worse. Now could I turn Cossack like LukÃ¡shka, and
steal horses, get drunk on
chikhir
, sing rollicking songs, kill people,
and when drunk climb in at her window for the night without a thought of who
and what I am, it would be different: then we might understand one another and
I might be happy.

âI tried to throw myself into that kind of life but was still more conscious of
my own weakness and artificiality. I cannot forget myself and my complex,
distorted past, and my future appears to me still more hopeless. Every day I
have before me the distant snowy mountains and this majestic, happy woman. But
not for me is the only happiness possible in the world; I cannot have this
woman! What is most terrible and yet sweetest in my condition is that I feel
that I understand her but that she will never understand me; not because she is
inferior: on the contrary she ought not to understand me. She is happy, she is
like nature: consistent, calm, and self-contained; and I, a weak distorted
being, want her to understand my deformity and my torments! I have not slept at
night, but have aimlessly passed under her windows not rendering account to
myself of what was happening to me. On the 18th our company started on a raid,
and I spent three days away from the village. I was sad and apathetic, the
usual songs, cards, drinking-bouts, and talk of rewards in the regiment, were
more repulsive to me than usual. Yesterday I returned home and saw her, my hut.
Daddy ErÃ³shka, and the snowy mountains, from my porch, and was seized by such a
strong, new feeling of joy that I understood it all. I love this woman; I feel
real love for the first and only time in my life. I know what has befallen me.
I do not fear to be degraded by this feeling, I am not ashamed of my love, I am
proud of it. It is not my fault that I love. It has come about against my will.
I tried to escape from my love by self-renunciation, and tried to devise a joy
in the Cossack LukÃ¡shkaâs and MaryÃ¡nkaâs love, but thereby only stirred up my
own love and jealousy. This is not the ideal, the so-called exalted love which
I have known before; not that sort of attachment in which you admire your own
love and feel that the source of your emotion is within yourself and do
everything yourself. I have felt that too. It is still less a desire for
enjoyment: it is something different. Perhaps in her I love nature: the
personification of all that is beautiful in nature; but yet I am not acting by
my own will, but some elemental force loves through me; the whole of Godâs
world, all nature, presses this love into my soul and says, âLove her.â I love
her not with my mind or my imagination, but with my whole being. Loving her I
feel myself to be an integral part of all Godâs joyous world. I wrote before
about the new convictions to which my solitary life had brought me, but no one
knows with what labour they shaped themselves within me and with what joy I
realized them and saw a new way of life opening out before me; nothing was
dearer to me than those convictions... Well! ... love has come and neither they
nor any regrets for them remain! It is even difficult for me to believe that I
could prize such a one-sided, cold, and abstract state of mind. Beauty came and
scattered to the winds all that laborious inward toil, and no regret remains
for what has vanished! Self-renunciation is all nonsense and absurdity! That is
pride, a refuge from well-merited unhappiness, and salvation from the envy of
othersâ happiness: âLive for others, and do good!ââWhy? when in my soul there
is only love for myself and the desire to love her and to live her life with
her? Not for others, not for LukÃ¡shka, I now desire happiness. I do not now
love those others. Formerly I should have told myself that this is wrong. I
should have tormented myself with the questions: What will become of her, of
me, and of LukÃ¡shka? Now I donât care. I do not live my own life, there is
something stronger than me which directs me. I suffer; but formerly I was dead
and only now do I live. Today I will go to their house and tell her
everything.â

Chapter XXXIV

Late that evening, after writing this letter, OlÃ©nin went to his hostsâ hut.
The old woman was sitting on a bench behind the oven unwinding cocoons.
MaryÃ¡nka with her head uncovered sat sewing by the light of a candle. On seeing
OlÃ©nin she jumped up, took her kerchief and stepped to the oven.

âMaryÃ¡nka dear,â said her mother, âwonât you sit here with me a bit?â

âNo, Iâm bareheaded,â she replied, and sprang up on the oven.

OlÃ©nin could only see a knee, and one of her shapely legs hanging down from the
oven. He treated the old woman to tea. She treated her guest to clotted cream
which she sent MaryÃ¡nka to fetch. But having put a plateful on the table
MaryÃ¡nka again sprang on the oven from whence OlÃ©nin felt her eyes upon him.
They talked about household matters. Granny UlÃ­tka became animated and went
into raptures of hospitality. She brought OlÃ©nin preserved grapes and a grape
tart and some of her best wine, and pressed him to eat and drink with the rough
yet proud hospitality of country folk, only found among those who produce their
bread by the labour of their own hands.

The old woman, who had at first struck OlÃ©nin so much by her rudeness, now
often touched him by her simple tenderness towards her daughter.

âYes, we need not offend the Lord by grumbling! We have enough of everything,
thank God. We have pressed sufficient
chikhir
and have preserved and
shall sell three or four barrels of grapes and have enough left to drink. Donât
be in a hurry to leave us. We will make merry together at the wedding.â

âAnd when is the wedding to be?â asked OlÃ©nin, feeling his blood suddenly rush
to his face while his heart beat irregularly and painfully.

He heard a movement on the oven and the sound of seeds being cracked.

âWell, you know, it ought to be next week. We are quite ready,â replied the old
woman, as simply and quietly as though OlÃ©nin did not exist. âI have prepared
and have procured everything for MaryÃ¡nka. We will give her away properly. Only
thereâs one thing not quite right. Our LukÃ¡shka has been running rather wild.
He has been too much on the spree! Heâs up to tricks! The other day a Cossack
came here from his company and said he had been to NogÃ¡y.â

âHe must mind he does not get caught,â said OlÃ©nin.

âYes, thatâs what I tell him. âMind, LukÃ¡shka, donât you get into mischief.
Well, of course, a young fellow naturally wants to cut a dash. But thereâs a
time for everything. Well, youâve captured or stolen something and killed an

abrek!
Well, youâre a fine fellow! But now you should live quietly for a
bit, or else thereâll be trouble.ââ

âYes, I saw him a time or two in the division, he was always merry-making. He
has sold another horse,â said OlÃ©nin, and glanced towards the oven. A pair of
large, dark, and hostile eyes glittered as they gazed severely at him.

He became ashamed of what he had said. âWhat of it? He does no one any harm,â
suddenly remarked MaryÃ¡nka. âHe makes merry with his own money,â and lowering
her legs she jumped down from the oven and went out banging the door.

OlÃ©nin followed her with his eyes as long as she was in the hut, and then
looked at the door and waited, understanding nothing of what Granny UlÃ­tka was
telling him.

A few minutes later some visitors arrived: an old man, Granny UlÃ­tkaâs brother,
with Daddy ErÃ³shka, and following them came MaryÃ¡nka and Ãstenka.

âGood evening,â squeaked Ãstenka. âStill on holiday?â she added, turning to
OlÃ©nin.

âYes, still on holiday,â he replied, and felt, he did not know why, ashamed and
ill at ease.

He wished to go away but could not. It also seemed to him impossible to remain
silent. The old man helped him by asking for a drink, and they had a drink.
OlÃ©nin drank with ErÃ³shka, with the other Cossack, and again with ErÃ³shka, and
the more he drank the heavier was his heart. But the two old men grew merry.
The girls climbed onto the oven, where they sat whispering and looking at the
men, who drank till it was late. OlÃ©nin did not talk, but drank more than the
others. The Cossacks were shouting. The old woman would not let them have any
more
chikhir
, and at last turned them out. The girls laughed at Daddy
ErÃ³shka, and it was past ten when they all went out into the porch. The old men
invited themselves to finish their merry-making at OlÃ©ninâs. Ãstenka ran off
home and ErÃ³shka led the old Cossack to VanyÃºsha. The old woman went out to
tidy up the shed. MaryÃ¡nka remained alone in the hut. OlÃ©nin felt fresh and
joyous, as if he had only just woke up. He noticed everything, and having let
the old men pass ahead he turned back to the hut where MaryÃ¡nka was preparing
for bed. He went up to her and wished to say something, but his voice broke.
She moved away from him, sat down cross-legged on her bed in the corner, and
looked at him silently with wild and frightened eyes. She was evidently afraid
of him. OlÃ©nin felt this. He felt sorry and ashamed of himself, and at the same
time proud and pleased that he aroused even that feeling in her.

âMaryÃ¡nka!â he said. âWill you never take pity on me? I canât tell you how I
love you.â

She moved still farther away.

âJust hear how the wine is speaking! ... Youâll get nothing from me!â

âNo, it is not the wine. Donât marry LukÃ¡shka. I will marry you.â (âWhat am I
saying,â he thought as he uttered these words. âShall I be able to say the same
tomorrow?â âYes, I shall, I am sure I shall, and I will repeat them now,â
replied an inner voice.)

âWill you marry me?â

She looked at him seriously and her fear seemed to have passed.

âMaryÃ¡nka, I shall go out of my mind! I am not myself. I will do whatever you
command,â and madly tender words came from his lips of their own accord.

âNow then, what are you drivelling about?â she interrupted, suddenly seizing
the arm he was stretching towards her. She did not push his arm away but
pressed it firmly with her strong hard fingers. âDo gentlemen marry Cossack
girls? Go away!â

âBut will you? Everything...â

âAnd what shall we do with LukÃ¡shka?â said she, laughing.

He snatched away the arm she was holding and firmly embraced her young body,
but she sprang away like a fawn and ran barefoot into the porch: OlÃ©nin came to
his senses and was terrified at himself. He again felt himself inexpressibly
vile compared to her, yet not repenting for an instant of what he had said he
went home, and without even glancing at the old men who were drinking in his
room he lay down and fell asleep more soundly than he had done for a long time.

Chapter XXXV

The next day was a holiday. In the evening all the villagers, their holiday
clothes shining in the sunset, were out in the street. That season more wine
than usual had been produced, and the people were now free from their labours.
In a month the Cossacks were to start on a campaign and in many families
preparations were being made for weddings.

Most of the people were standing in the square in front of the Cossack
Government Office and near the two shops, in one of which cakes and pumpkin
seeds were sold, in the other kerchiefs and cotton prints. On the
earth-embankment of the office-building sat or stood the old men in sober grey,
or black coats without gold trimmings or any kind of ornament. They conversed
among themselves quietly in measured tones, about the harvest, about the young
folk, about village affairs, and about old times, looking with dignified
equanimity at the younger generation. Passing by them, the women and girls
stopped and bent their heads. The young Cossacks respectfully slackened their
pace and raised their caps, holding them for a while over their heads. The old
men then stopped speaking. Some of them watched the passers-by severely, others
kindly, and in their turn slowly took off their caps and put them on again.

The Cossack girls had not yet started dancing their
khorovÃ³ds
, but having
gathered in groups, in their bright coloured
beshmets
with white
kerchiefs on their heads pulled down to their eyes, they sat either on the
ground or on the earth-banks about the huts sheltered from the oblique rays of
the sun, and laughed and chattered in their ringing voices. Little boys and
girls playing in the square sent their balls high up into the clear sky, and
ran about squealing and shouting. The half-grown girls had started dancing
their
khorovÃ³ds
, and were timidly singing in their thin shrill voices.
Clerks, lads not in the service, or home for the holiday, bright-faced and
wearing smart white or new red Circassian gold-trimmed coats, went about arm in
arm in twos or threes from one group of women or girls to another, and stopped
to joke and chat with the Cossack girls. The Armenian shopkeeper, in a
gold-trimmed coat of fine blue cloth, stood at the open door through which
piles of folded bright-coloured kerchiefs were visible and, conscious of his
own importance and with the pride of an Oriental tradesman, waited for
customers. Two red-bearded, barefooted ChÃ©chens, who had come from beyond the
TÃ©rek to see the fÃªte, sat on their heels outside the house of a friend,
negligently smoking their little pipes and occasionally spitting, watching the
villagers and exchanging remarks with one another in their rapid guttural
speech. Occasionally a workaday-looking soldier in an old overcoat passed
across the square among the bright-clad girls. Here and there the songs of
tipsy Cossacks who were merry-making could already be heard. All the huts were
closed; the porches had been scrubbed clean the day before. Even the old women
were out in the street, which was everywhere sprinkled with pumpkin and melon
seed-shells. The air was warm and still, the sky deep and clear. Beyond the
roofs the dead-white mountain range, which seemed very near, was turning rosy
in the glow of the evening sun. Now and then from the other side of the river
came the distant roar of a cannon, but above the village, mingling with one
another, floated all sorts of merry holiday sounds.

OlÃ©nin had been pacing the yard all that morning hoping to see MaryÃ¡nka. But
she, having put on holiday clothes, went to Mass at the chapel and afterwards
sat with the other girls on an earth-embankment cracking seeds; sometimes
again, together with her companions, she ran home, and each time gave the
lodger a bright and kindly look. OlÃ©nin felt afraid to address her playfully or
in the presence of others. He wished to finish telling her what he had begun to
say the night before, and to get her to give him a definite answer. He waited
for another moment like that of yesterday evening, but the moment did not come,
and he felt that he could not remain any longer in this uncertainty. She went
out into the street again, and after waiting awhile he too went out and without
knowing where he was going he followed her. He passed by the corner where she
was sitting in her shining blue satin
beshmet
, and with an aching heart
he heard behind him the girls laughing.

BelÃ©tskiâs hut looked out onto the square. As OlÃ©nin was passing it he heard
BelÃ©tskiâs voice calling to him, âCome in,â and in he went.

After a short talk they both sat down by the window and were soon joined by
ErÃ³shka, who entered dressed in a new
beshmet
and sat down on the floor
beside them.

âThere, thatâs the aristocratic party,â said BelÃ©tski, pointing with his
cigarette to a brightly coloured group at the corner. âMine is there too. Do
you see her? in red. Thatâs a new
beshmet
. Why donât you start the

khorovÃ³d?
â he shouted, leaning out of the window. âWait a bit, and then
when it grows dark let us go too. Then we will invite them to Ãstenkaâs. We
must arrange a ball for them!â

âAnd I will come to Ãstenkaâs,â said OlÃ©nin in a decided tone. âWill MaryÃ¡nka
be there?â

âYes, sheâll be there. Do come!â said BelÃ©tski, without the least surprise.
âBut isnât it a pretty picture?â he added, pointing to the motley crowds.

âYes, very!â OlÃ©nin assented, trying to appear indifferent.

âHolidays of this kind,â he added, âalways make me wonder why all these people
should suddenly be contented and jolly. Today for instance, just because it
happens to be the fifteenth of the month, everything is festive. Eyes and faces
and voices and movements and garments, and the air and the sun, are all in a
holiday mood. And we no longer have any holidays!â

âYes,â said BelÃ©tski, who did not like such reflections.

âAnd why are you not drinking, old fellow?â he said, turning to ErÃ³shka.

ErÃ³shka winked at OlÃ©nin, pointing to BelÃ©tski. âEh, heâs a proud one that

kunak
of yours,â he said.

BelÃ©tski raised his glass.

â
Allah birdy!
â he said, emptying it. (
Allah birdy
, âGod has
given!ââthe usual greeting of Caucasians when drinking together.)

â
Sau bul
â (âYour healthâ), answered ErÃ³shka smiling, and emptied his glass.

âSpeaking of holidays!â he said, turning to OlÃ©nin as he rose and looked out of
the window, âWhat sort of holiday is that! You should have seen them make merry
in the old days! The women used to come out in their gold-trimmed

sarafÃ¡ns
. Two rows of gold coins hanging round their necks and
gold-cloth diadems on their heads, and when they passed they made a noise,
âflu, flu,â with their dresses. Every woman looked like a princess. Sometimes
theyâd come out, a whole herd of them, and begin singing songs so that the air
seemed to rumble, and they went on making merry all night. And the Cossacks
would roll out a barrel into the yards and sit down and drink till break of
day, or they would go hand-in-hand sweeping the village. Whoever they met they
seized and took along with them, and went from house to house. Sometimes they
used to make merry for three days on end. Father used to come homeâI still
remember itâquite red and swollen, without a cap, having lost everything: heâd
come and lie down. Mother knew what to do: she would bring him some fresh
caviar and a little
chikhir
to sober him up, and would herself run about
in the village looking for his cap. Then heâd sleep for two days! Thatâs the
sort of fellows they were then! But now what are they?â

âWell, and the girls in the
sarafÃ¡ns
, did they make merry all by
themselves?â asked BelÃ©tski.

âYes, they did! Sometimes Cossacks would come on foot or on horse and say,
âLetâs break up the
khorovÃ³ds
,â and theyâd go, but the girls would take
up cudgels. Carnival week, some young fellow would come galloping up, and
theyâd cudgel his horse and cudgel him too. But heâd break through, seize the
one he loved, and carry her off. And his sweetheart would love him to his
heartâs content! Yes, the girls in those days, they were regular queens!â

Chapter XXXVI

Just then two men rode out of the side street into the square. One of them was
NazÃ¡rka. The other, LukÃ¡shka, sat slightly sideways on his well-fed bay KabardÃ¡
horse which stepped lightly over the hard road jerking its beautiful head with
its fine glossy mane. The well-adjusted gun in its cover, the pistol at his
back, and the cloak rolled up behind his saddle showed that LukÃ¡shka had not
come from a peaceful place or from one near by. The smart way in which he sat a
little sideways on his horse, the careless motion with which he touched the
horse under its belly with his whip, and especially his half-closed black eyes,
glistening as he looked proudly around him, all expressed the conscious
strength and self-confidence of youth. âEver seen as fine a lad?â his eyes,
looking from side to side, seemed to say. The elegant horse with its silver
ornaments and trappings, the weapons, and the handsome Cossack himself
attracted the attention of everyone in the square. NazÃ¡rka, lean and short, was
much less well dressed. As he rode past the old men, LukÃ¡shka paused and raised
his curly white sheepskin cap above his closely cropped black head.

âWell, have you carried off many NogÃ¡y horses?â asked a lean old man with a
frowning, lowering look.

âHave you counted them, Grandad, that you ask?â replied LukÃ¡shka, turning away.

âThatâs all very well, but you need not take my lad along with you,â the old
man muttered with a still darker frown.

âJust see the old devil, he knows everything,â muttered LukÃ¡shka to himself,
and a worried expression came over his face; but then, noticing a corner where
a number of Cossack girls were standing, he turned his horse towards them.

âGood evening, girls!â he shouted in his powerful, resonant voice, suddenly
checking his horse. âYouâve grown old without me, you witches!â and he laughed.

âGood evening, LukÃ¡shka! Good evening, laddie!â the merry voices answered.
âHave you brought much money? Buy some sweets for the girls!... Have you come
for long? True enough, itâs long since we saw you....â

âNazÃ¡rka and I have just flown across to make a night of it,â replied LukÃ¡shka,
raising his whip and riding straight at the girls.

âWhy, MaryÃ¡nka has quite forgotten you,â said Ãstenka, nudging MaryÃ¡nka with
her elbow and breaking into a shrill laugh.

MaryÃ¡nka moved away from the horse and throwing back her head calmly looked at
the Cossack with her large sparkling eyes.

âTrue enough, you have not been home for a long time! Why are you trampling us
under your horse?â she remarked dryly, and turned away.

LukÃ¡shka had appeared particularly merry. His face shone with audacity and joy.
Obviously staggered by MaryÃ¡nkaâs cold reply he suddenly knitted his brow.

âStep up on my stirrup and Iâll carry you away to the mountains. Mammy!â he
suddenly exclaimed, and as if to disperse his dark thoughts he caracoled among
the girls. Stooping down towards MaryÃ¡nka, he said, âIâll kiss, oh, how Iâll
kiss you! ...â

MaryÃ¡nkaâs eyes met his and she suddenly blushed and stepped back.

âOh, bother you! youâll crush my feet,â she said, and bending her head looked
at her well-shaped feet in their tightly fitting light blue stockings with
clocks and her new red slippers trimmed with narrow silver braid.

LukÃ¡shka turned towards Ãstenka, and MaryÃ¡nka sat down next to a woman with a
baby in her arms. The baby stretched his plump little hands towards the girl
and seized a necklace string that hung down onto her blue
beshmet
.
MaryÃ¡nka bent towards the child and glanced at LukÃ¡shka from the corner of her
eyes. LukÃ¡shka just then was getting out from under his coat, from the pocket
of his black
beshmet
, a bundle of sweetmeats and seeds.

âThere, I give them to all of you,â he said, handing the bundle to Ãstenka and
smiling at MaryÃ¡nka.

A confused expression again appeared on the girlâs face. It was as though a
mist gathered over her beautiful eyes. She drew her kerchief down below her
lips, and leaning her head over the fair-skinned face of the baby that still
held her by her coin necklace she suddenly began to kiss it greedily. The baby
pressed his little hands against the girlâs high breasts, and opening his
toothless mouth screamed loudly.

âYouâre smothering the boy!â said the little oneâs mother, taking him away; and
she unfastened her
beshmet
to give him the breast. âYouâd better have a
chat with the young fellow.â

âIâll only go and put up my horse and then NazÃ¡rka and I will come back; weâll
make merry all night,â said LukÃ¡shka, touching his horse with his whip and
riding away from the girls.

Turning into a side street, he and NazÃ¡rka rode up to two huts that stood side
by side.

âHere we are all right, old fellow! Be quick and come soon!â called LukÃ¡shka to
his comrade, dismounting in front of one of the huts; then he carefully led his
horse in at the gate of the wattle fence of his own home.

âHow dâyou do, StÃ«pka?â he said to his dumb sister, who, smartly dressed like
the others, came in from the street to take his horse; and he made signs to her
to take the horse to the hay, but not to unsaddle it.

The dumb girl made her usual humming noise, smacked her lips as she pointed to
the horse and kissed it on the nose, as much as to say that she loved it and
that it was a fine horse.

âHow dâyou do, Mother? How is it that you have not gone out yet?â shouted
LukÃ¡shka, holding his gun in place as he mounted the steps of the porch.

His old mother opened the door.

âDear me! I never expected, never thought, youâd come,â said the old woman.
âWhy, KÃ­rka said you wouldnât be here.â

âGo and bring some
chikhir
, Mother. NazÃ¡rka is coming here and we will
celebrate the feast day.â

âDirectly, LukÃ¡shka, directly!â answered the old woman. âOur women are making
merry. I expect our dumb one has gone too.â

She took her keys and hurriedly went to the outhouse. NazÃ¡rka, after putting up
his horse and taking the gun off his shoulder, returned to LukÃ¡shkaâs house and
went in.

Chapter XXXVII

âYour health!â said LukÃ¡shka, taking from his motherâs hands a cup filled to
the brim with
chikhir
and carefully raising it to his bowed head.

âA bad business!â said NazÃ¡rka. âYou heard how Daddy BurlÃ¡k said, âHave you
stolen many horses?â He seems to know!â

âA regular wizard!â LukÃ¡shka replied shortly. âBut what of it!â he added,
tossing his head. âThey are across the river by now. Go and find them!â

âStill itâs a bad lookout.â

âWhatâs a bad lookout? Go and take some
chikhir
to him tomorrow and
nothing will come of it. Now letâs make merry. Drink!â shouted LukÃ¡shka, just
in the tone in which old ErÃ³shka uttered the word. âWeâll go out into the
street and make merry with the girls. You go and get some honey; or no, Iâll
send our dumb wench. Weâll make merry till morning.â

NazÃ¡rka smiled.

âAre we stopping here long?â he asked.

âTill weâve had a bit of fun. Run and get some vodka. Hereâs the money.â

NazÃ¡rka ran off obediently to get the vodka from YÃ¡mkaâs.

Daddy ErÃ³shka and ErgushÃ³v, like birds of prey, scenting where the merry-making
was going on, tumbled into the hut one after the other, both tipsy.

âBring us another half-pail,â shouted LukÃ¡shka to his mother, by way of reply
to their greeting.

âNow then, tell us where did you steal them, you devil?â shouted ErÃ³shka. âFine
fellow, Iâm fond of you!â

âFond indeed...â answered LukÃ¡shka laughing, âcarrying sweets from cadets to
lasses! Eh, you old...â

âThatâs not true, not true! ... Oh, Mark,â and the old man burst out laughing.
âAnd how that devil begged me. âGo,â he said, âand arrange it.â He offered me a
gun! But no. Iâd have managed it, but I feel for you. Now tell us where have
you been?â And the old man began speaking in Tartar.

LukÃ¡shka answered him promptly.

ErgushÃ³v, who did not know much Tartar, only occasionally put in a word in
Russian: âWhat I say is heâs driven away the horses. I know it for a fact,â he
chimed in.

âGirÃ©y and I went together.â (His speaking of GirÃ©y Khan as âGirÃ©yâ was, to the
Cossack mind, evidence of his boldness.) âJust beyond the river he kept
bragging that he knew the whole of the steppe and would lead the way straight,
but we rode on and the night was dark, and my GirÃ©y lost his way and began
wandering in a circle without getting anywhere: couldnât find the village, and
there we were. We must have gone too much to the right. I believe we wandered
about well-nigh till midnight. Then, thank goodness, we heard dogs howling.â

âFools!â said Daddy ErÃ³shka. âThere now, we too used to lose our way in the
steppe. (Who the devil can follow it?) But I used to ride up a hillock and
start howling like the wolves, like this!â He placed his hands before his
mouth, and howled like a pack of wolves, all on one note. âThe dogs would
answer at once ... Well, go onâso you found them?â

âWe soon led them away! NazÃ¡rka was nearly caught by some NogÃ¡y women, he was!â

âCaught indeed,â NazÃ¡rka, who had just come back, said in an injured tone.

âWe rode off again, and again GirÃ©y lost his way and almost landed us among the
sand-drifts. We thought we were just getting to the TÃ©rek but we were riding
away from it all the time!â

âYou should have steered by the stars,â said Daddy ErÃ³shka.

âThatâs what I say,â interjected ErgushÃ³v.

âYes, steer when all is black; I tried and tried all about... and at last I put
the bridle on one of the mares and let my own horse go freeâthinking heâll lead
us out, and what do you think! he just gave a snort or two with his nose to the
ground, galloped ahead, and led us straight to our village. Thank goodness! It
was getting quite light. We barely had time to hide them in the forest. NagÃ­m
came across the river and took them away.â

ErgushÃ³v shook his head. âItâs just what I said. Smart. Did you get much for
them?â

âItâs all here,â said LukÃ¡shka, slapping his pocket.

Just then his mother came into the room, and LukÃ¡shka did not finish what he
was saying.

âDrink!â he shouted.

âWe too, GÃ­rich and I, rode out late one night...â began ErÃ³shka.

âOh bother, weâll never hear the end of you!â said LukÃ¡shka. âI am going.â And
having emptied his cup and tightened the strap of his belt he went out.

Chapter XXXVIII

It was already dark when LukÃ¡shka went out into the street. The autumn night
was fresh and calm. The full golden moon floated up behind the tall dark
poplars that grew on one side of the square. From the chimneys of the outhouses
smoke rose and spread above the village, mingling with the mist. Here and there
lights shone through the windows, and the air was laden with the smell of

kisyak
, grape-pulp, and mist. The sounds of voices, laughter, songs, and
the cracking of seeds mingled just as they had done in the daytime, but were
now more distinct. Clusters of white kerchiefs and caps gleamed through the
darkness near the houses and by the fences.

In the square, before the shop door which was lit up and open, the black and
white figures of Cossack men and maids showed through the darkness, and one
heard from afar their loud songs and laughter and talk. The girls, hand in
hand, went round and round in a circle stepping lightly in the dusty square. A
skinny girl, the plainest of them all, set the tune:

âFrom beyond the wood, from the forest dark,

From the garden green and the shady park,

There came out one day two young lads so gay.

Young bachelors, hey! brave and smart were they!

And they walked and walked, then stood still, each man,

And they talked and soon to dispute began!

Then a maid came out; as she came along,

Said, âTo one of you I shall soon belong!â

âTwas the fair-faced lad got the maiden fair,

Yes, the fair-faced lad with the golden hair!

Her right hand so white in his own took he,

And he led her round for his mates to see!

And said, âHave you ever in all your life,

Met a lass as fair as my sweet little wife?ââ

The old women stood round listening to the songs. The little boys and girls ran
about chasing one another in the dark. The men stood by, catching at the girls
as the latter moved round, and sometimes breaking the ring and entering it. On
the dark side of the doorway stood BelÃ©tski and OlÃ©nin, in their Circassian
coats and sheepskin caps, and talked together in a style of speech unlike that
of the Cossacks, in low but distinct tones, conscious that they were attracting
attention.

Next to one another in the
khorovÃ³d
circle moved plump little Ãstenka in
her red
beshmet
and the stately MaryÃ¡nka in her new smock and

beshmet
. OlÃ©nin and BelÃ©tski were discussing how to snatch Ãstenka and
MaryÃ¡nka out of the ring. BelÃ©tski thought that OlÃ©nin wished only to amuse
himself, but OlÃ©nin was expecting his fate to be decided. He wanted at any cost
to see MaryÃ¡nka alone that very day and to tell her everything, and ask her
whether she could and would be his wife. Although that question had long been
answered in the negative in his own mind, he hoped he would be able to tell her
all he felt, and that she would understand him.

âWhy did you not tell me sooner?â said BelÃ©tski. âI would have got Ãstenka to
arrange it for you. You are such a queer fellow! ...â

âWhatâs to be done! ... Some day, very soon, Iâll tell you all about it. Only
now, for Heavenâs sake, arrange so that she should come to Ãstenkaâs.â

âAll right, thatâs easily done! Well, MaryÃ¡nka, will you belong to the
âfair-faced ladâ, and not to LukÃ¡shka?â said BelÃ©tski, speaking to MaryÃ¡nka
first for proprietyâs sake, but having received no reply he went up to Ãstenka
and begged her to bring MaryÃ¡nka home with her. He had hardly time to finish
what he was saying before the leader began another song and the girls started
pulling each other round in the ring by the hand.

They sang:

Past the garden, by the garden,

A young man came strolling down,

Up the street and through the town.

And the first time as he passed

He did wave his strong right hand.

As the second time he passed

Waved his hat with silken band.

But the third time as he went

He stood still: before her bent.

How is it that thou, my dear,

My reproaches dost not fear?

In the park donât come to walk

That we there might have a talk?

Come now, answer me, my dear,

Dost thou hold me in contempt?

Later on, thou knowest, dear,

Thouâlt get sober and repent.

Soon to woo thee I will come,

And when we shall married be

Thou wilt weep because of me!

Though I knew what to reply,

Yet I dared not him deny,

No, I dared not him deny!

So into the park went I,

In the park my lad to meet,

There my dear one I did greet.

Maiden dear, I bow to thee!

Take this handkerchief from me.

In thy white hand take it, see!

Say I am beloved by thee.

I donât know at all, I fear,

What I am to give thee, dear!

To my dear I think I will

Of a shawl a present makeâ

And five kisses for it take.

LukÃ¡shka and NazÃ¡rka broke into the ring and started walking about among the
girls. LukÃ¡shka joined in the singing, taking seconds in his clear voice as he
walked in the middle of the ring swinging his arms. âWell, come in, one of
you!â he said. The other girls pushed MaryÃ¡nka, but she would not enter the
ring. The sound of shrill laughter, slaps, kisses, and whispers mingled with
the singing.

As he went past OlÃ©nin, LukÃ¡shka gave a friendly nod.

âDmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich! Have you too come to have a look?â he said.

âYes,â answered OlÃ©nin dryly.

BelÃ©tski stooped and whispered something into Ãstenkaâs ear. She had not time
to reply till she came round again, when she said:

âAll right, weâll come.â

âAnd MaryÃ¡nka too?â

OlÃ©nin stooped towards MaryÃ¡nka. âYouâll come? Please do, if only for a minute.
I must speak to you.â

âIf the other girls come, I will.â

âWill you answer my question?â said he, bending towards her. âYou are in good
spirits today.â

She had already moved past him. He went after her.

âWill you answer?â

âAnswer what?â

âThe question I asked you the other day,â said OlÃ©nin, stooping to her ear.
âWill you marry me?â

MaryÃ¡nka thought for a moment.

âIâll tell you,â said she, âIâll tell you tonight.â

And through the darkness her eyes gleamed brightly and kindly at the young man.

He still followed her. He enjoyed stooping closer to her. But LukÃ¡shka, without
ceasing to sing, suddenly seized her firmly by the hand and pulled her from her
place in the ring of girls into the middle. OlÃ©nin had only time to say, âCome
to Ãstenkaâs,â and stepped back to his companion.

The song came to an end. LukÃ¡shka wiped his lips, MaryÃ¡nka did the same, and
they kissed. âNo, no, kisses five!â said LukÃ¡shka. Chatter, laughter, and
running about, succeeded to the rhythmic movements and sound. LukÃ¡shka, who
seemed to have drunk a great deal, began to distribute sweetmeats to the girls.

âI offer them to everyone!â he said with proud, comically pathetic
self-admiration. âBut anyone who goes after soldiers goes out of the ring!â he
suddenly added, with an angry glance at OlÃ©nin.

The girls grabbed his sweetmeats from him, and, laughing, struggled for them
among themselves. BelÃ©tski and OlÃ©nin stepped aside.

LukÃ¡shka, as if ashamed of his generosity, took off his cap and wiping his
forehead with his sleeve came up to MaryÃ¡nka and Ãstenka.

âAnswer me, my dear, dost thou hold me in contempt?â he said in the words of
the song they had just been singing, and turning to MaryÃ¡nka he angrily
repeated the words: âDost thou hold me in contempt? When we shall married be
thou wilt weep because of me!â he added, embracing Ãstenka and MaryÃ¡nka both
together.

Ãstenka tore herself away, and swinging her arm gave him such a blow on the
back that she hurt her hand.

âWell, are you going to have another turn?â he asked.

âThe other girls may if they like,â answered Ãstenka, âbut I am going home and
MaryÃ¡nka was coming to our house too.â

With his arm still round her, LukÃ¡shka led MaryÃ¡nka away from the crowd to the
darker corner of a house.

âDonât go, MaryÃ¡nka,â he said, âletâs have some fun for the last time. Go home
and I will come to you!â

âWhat am I to do at home? Holidays are meant for merrymaking. I am going to
Ãstenkaâs,â replied MaryÃ¡nka.

âIâll marry you all the same, you know!â

âAll right,â said MaryÃ¡nka, âwe shall see when the time comes.â

âSo you are going,â said LukÃ¡shka sternly, and, pressing her close, he kissed
her on the cheek.

âThere, leave off! Donât bother,â and MaryÃ¡nka, wrenching herself from his
arms, moved away.

âAh my girl, it will turn out badly,â said LukÃ¡shka reproachfully and stood
still, shaking his head. âThou wilt weep because of me...â and turning away
from her he shouted to the other girls:

âNow then! Play away!â

What he had said seemed to have frightened and vexed MaryÃ¡nka. She stopped,
âWhat will turn out badly?â

âWhy, that!â

âThat what?â

âWhy, that you keep company with a soldier-lodger and no longer care for me!â

âIâll care just as long as I choose. Youâre not my father, nor my mother. What
do you want? Iâll care for whom I like!â

âWell, all right...â said LukÃ¡shka, âbut remember!â He moved towards the shop.
âGirls!â he shouted, âwhy have you stopped? Go on dancing. NazÃ¡rka, fetch some
more
chikhir
.â

âWell, will they come?â asked OlÃ©nin, addressing BelÃ©tski.

âTheyâll come directly,â replied BelÃ©tski. âCome along, we must prepare the
ball.â

Chapter XXXIX

It was already late in the night when OlÃ©nin came out of BelÃ©tskiâs hut
following MaryÃ¡nka and Ãstenka. He saw in the dark street before him the gleam
of the girlâs white kerchief. The golden moon was descending towards the
steppe. A silvery mist hung over the village. All was still; there were no
lights anywhere and one heard only the receding footsteps of the young women.
OlÃ©ninâs heart beat fast. The fresh moist atmosphere cooled his burning face.
He glanced at the sky and turned to look at the hut he had just come out of:
the candle was already out. Then he again peered through the darkness at the
girlsâ retreating shadows. The white kerchief disappeared in the mist. He was
afraid to remain alone, he was so happy. He jumped down from the porch and ran
after the girls.

âBother you, someone may see...â said Ãstenka.

âNever mind!â

OlÃ©nin ran up to MaryÃ¡nka and embraced her.

MaryÃ¡nka did not resist.

âHavenât you kissed enough yet?â said Ãstenka. âMarry and then kiss, but now
youâd better wait.â

âGood-night, MaryÃ¡nka. Tomorrow I will come to see your father and tell him.
Donât you say anything.â

âWhy should I!â answered MaryÃ¡nka.

Both the girls started running. OlÃ©nin went on by himself thinking over all
that had happened. He had spent the whole evening alone with her in a corner by
the oven. Ãstenka had not left the hut for a single moment, but had romped
about with the other girls and with BelÃ©tski all the time. OlÃ©nin had talked in
whispers to MaryÃ¡nka.

âWill you marry me?â he had asked.

âYouâd deceive me and not have me,â she replied cheerfully and calmly.

âBut do you love me? Tell me for Godâs sake!â

âWhy shouldnât I love you? You donât squint,â answered MaryÃ¡nka, laughing and
with her hard hands squeezing his....

âWhat whi-ite, whi-i-ite, soft hands youâve gotâso like clotted cream,â she
said.

âI am in earnest. Tell me, will you marry me?â

âWhy not, if father gives me to you?â

âWell then remember, I shall go mad if you deceive me. Tomorrow I will tell
your mother and father. I shall come and propose.â

MaryÃ¡nka suddenly burst out laughing.

âWhatâs the matter?â

âIt seems so funny!â

âItâs true! I will buy a vineyard and a house and will enroll myself as a
Cossack.â

âMind you donât go after other women then. I am severe about that.â

OlÃ©nin joyfully repeated all these words to himself. The memory of them now
gave him pain and now such joy that it took away his breath. The pain was
because she had remained as calm as usual while talking to him. She did not
seem at all agitated by these new conditions. It was as if she did not trust
him and did not think of the future. It seemed to him that she only loved him
for the present moment, and that in her mind there was no future with him. He
was happy because her words sounded to him true, and she had consented to be
his. âYes,â thought he to himself, âwe shall only understand one another when
she is quite mine. For such love there are no words. It needs lifeâthe whole of
life. Tomorrow everything will be cleared up. I cannot live like this any
longer; tomorrow I will tell everything to her father, to BelÃ©tski, and to the
whole village.â

LukÃ¡shka, after two sleepless nights, had drunk so much at the fÃªte that for
the first time in his life his feet would not carry him, and he slept in
YÃ¡mkaâs house.

Chapter XL

The next day OlÃ©nin awoke earlier than usual, and immediately remembered what
lay before him, and he joyfully recalled her kisses, the pressure of her hard
hands, and her words, âWhat white hands you have!â He jumped up and wished to
go at once to his hostsâ hut to ask for their consent to his marriage with
MaryÃ¡nka. The sun had not yet risen, but it seemed that there was an unusual
bustle in the street and side-street: people were moving about on foot and on
horseback, and talking. He threw on his Circassian coat and hastened out into
the porch. His hosts were not yet up. Five Cossacks were riding past and
talking loudly together. In front rode LukÃ¡shka on his broad-backed KabardÃ¡
horse.

The Cossacks were all speaking and shouting so that it was impossible to make
out exactly what they were saying.

âRide to the Upper Post,â shouted one.

âSaddle and catch us up, be quick,â said another.

âItâs nearer through the other gate!â

âWhat are you talking about?â cried LukÃ¡shka. âWe must go through the middle
gates, of course.â

âSo we must, itâs nearer that way,â said one of the Cossacks who was covered
with dust and rode a perspiring horse. LukÃ¡shkaâs face was red and swollen
after the drinking of the previous night and his cap was pushed to the back of
his head. He was calling out with authority as though he were an officer.

âWhat is the matter? Where are you going?â asked OlÃ©nin, with difficulty
attracting the Cossacksâ attention.

âWe are off to catch
abreks
. Theyâre hiding among the sand-drifts. We
are just off, but there are not enough of us yet.â

And the Cossacks continued to shout, more and more of them joining as they rode
down the street. It occurred to OlÃ©nin that it would not look well for him to
stay behind; besides he thought he could soon come back. He dressed, loaded his
gun with bullets, jumped onto his horse which VanyÃºsha had saddled more or less
well, and overtook the Cossacks at the village gates. The Cossacks had
dismounted, and filling a wooden bowl with
chikhir
from a little cask
which they had brought with them, they passed the bowl round to one another and
drank to the success of their expedition. Among them was a smartly dressed
young cornet, who happened to be in the village and who took command of the
group of nine Cossacks who had joined for the expedition. All these Cossacks
were privates, and although the cornet assumed the airs of a commanding
officer, they only obeyed LukÃ¡shka. Of OlÃ©nin they took no notice at all, and
when they had all mounted and started, and OlÃ©nin rode up to the cornet and
began asking him what was taking place, the cornet, who was usually quite
friendly, treated him with marked condescension. It was with great difficulty
that OlÃ©nin managed to find out from him what was happening. Scouts who had
been sent out to search for
abreks
had come upon several hillsmen some
six miles from the village. These
abreks
had taken shelter in pits and
had fired at the scouts, declaring they would not surrender. A corporal who had
been scouting with two Cossacks had remained to watch the
abreks
, and
had sent one Cossack back to get help.

The sun was just rising. Three miles beyond the village the steppe spread out
and nothing was visible except the dry, monotonous, sandy, dismal plain covered
with the footmarks of cattle, and here and there with tufts of withered grass,
with low reeds in the flats, and rare, little-trodden footpaths, and the camps
of the nomad NogÃ¡y tribe just visible far away. The absence of shade and the
austere aspect of the place were striking. The sun always rises and sets red in
the steppe. When it is windy whole hills of sand are carried by the wind from
place to place.

When it is calm, as it was that morning, the silence, uninterrupted by any
movement or sound, is peculiarly striking. That morning in the steppe it was
quiet and dull, though the sun had already risen. It all seemed specially soft
and desolate. The air was hushed, the footfalls and the snorting of the horses
were the only sounds to be heard, and even they quickly died away.

The men rode almost silently. A Cossack always carries his weapons so that they
neither jingle nor rattle. Jingling weapons are a terrible disgrace to a
Cossack. Two other Cossacks from the village caught the party up and exchanged
a few words. LukÃ¡shkaâs horse either stumbled or caught its foot in some grass,
and became restiveâwhich is a sign of bad luck among the Cossacks, and at such
a time was of special importance. The others exchanged glances and turned away,
trying not to notice what had happened. Lukaskha pulled at the reins, frowned
sternly, set his teeth, and flourished his whip above his head. His good
KabardÃ¡ horse, prancing from one foot to another not knowing with which to
start, seemed to wish to fly upwards on wings. But LukÃ¡shka hit its well-fed
sides with his whip once, then again, and a third time, and the horse, showing
its teeth and spreading out its tail, snorted and reared and stepped on its
hind legs a few paces away from the others.

âAh, a good steed that!â said the cornet.

That he said
steed
instead of
horse
indicated special praise.

âA lion of a horse,â assented one of the others, an old Cossack.

The Cossacks rode forward silently, now at a footpace, then at a trot, and
these changes were the only incidents that interrupted for a moment the
stillness and solemnity of their movements.

Riding through the steppe for about six miles, they passed nothing but one
NogÃ¡y tent, placed on a cart and moving slowly along at a distance of about a
mile from them. A NogÃ¡y family was moving from one part of the steppe to
another. Afterwards they met two tattered NogÃ¡y women with high cheekbones, who
with baskets on their backs were gathering dung left by the cattle that
wandered over the steppe. The cornet, who did not know their language well,
tried to question them, but they did not understand him and, obviously
frightened, looked at one another.

LukÃ¡shka rode up to them both, stopped his horse, and promptly uttered the
usual greeting. The NogÃ¡y women were evidently relieved, and began speaking to
him quite freely as to a brother.

â
Ay-ay, kop abrek!
â they said plaintively, pointing in the direction in which
the Cossacks were going. OlÃ©nin understood that they were saying, âMany

abreks
.â

Never having seen an engagement of that kind, and having formed an idea of them
only from Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs tales, OlÃ©nin wished not to be left behind by the
Cossacks, but wanted to see it all. He admired the Cossacks, and was on the
watch, looking and listening and making his own observations. Though he had
brought his sword and a loaded gun with him, when he noticed that the Cossacks
avoided him he decided to take no part in the action, as in his opinion his
courage had already been sufficiently proved when he was with his detachment,
and also because he was very happy.

Suddenly a shot was heard in the distance.

The cornet became excited, and began giving orders to the Cossacks as to how
they should divide and from which side they should approach. But the Cossacks
did not appear to pay any attention to these orders, listening only to what
LukÃ¡shka said and looking to him alone. LukÃ¡shkaâs face and figure were
expressive of calm solemnity. He put his horse to a trot with which the others
were unable to keep pace, and screwing up his eyes kept looking ahead.

âThereâs a man on horseback,â he said, reining in his horse and keeping in line
with the others.

OlÃ©nin looked intently, but could not see anything. The Cossacks soon
distinguished two riders and quietly rode straight towards them.

âAre those the
abreks?
â asked OlÃ©nin.

The Cossacks did not answer his question, which appeared quite meaningless to
them. The
abreks
would have been fools to venture across the river on
horseback.

âThatâs friend RÃ³dka waving to us, I do believe,â said LukÃ¡shka, pointing to
the two mounted men who were now clearly visible. âLook, heâs coming to us.â

A few minutes later it became plain that the two horsemen were the Cossack
scouts. The corporal rode up to LukÃ¡shka.

Chapter XLI

âAre they far?â was all LukÃ¡shka said.

Just then they heard a sharp shot some thirty paces off. The corporal smiled
slightly.

âOur GÃºrka is having shots at them,â he said, nodding in the direction of the
shot.

Having gone a few paces farther they saw GÃºrka sitting behind a sand-hillock
and loading his gun. To while away the time he was exchanging shots with the

abreks
, who were behind another sand-heap. A bullet came whistling from
their side.

The cornet was pale and grew confused. LukÃ¡shka dismounted from his horse,
threw the reins to one of the other Cossacks, and went up to GÃºrka. OlÃ©nin also
dismounted and, bending down, followed LukÃ¡shka. They had hardly reached GÃºrka
when two bullets whistled above them.

LukÃ¡shka looked around laughing at OlÃ©nin and stooped a little.

âLook out or they will kill you, DmÃ­tri AndrÃ©ich,â he said. âYouâd better go
awayâyou have no business here.â But OlÃ©nin wanted absolutely to see the

abreks
.

From behind the mound he saw caps and muskets some two hundred paces off.
Suddenly a little cloud of smoke appeared from thence, and again a bullet
whistled past. The
abreks
were hiding in a marsh at the foot of the
hill. OlÃ©nin was much impressed by the place in which they sat. In reality it
was very much like the rest of the steppe, but because the
abreks
sat
there it seemed to detach itself from all the rest and to have become
distinguished. Indeed it appeared to OlÃ©nin that it was the very spot for

abreks
to occupy. LukÃ¡shka went back to his horse and OlÃ©nin followed
him.

âWe must get a hay-cart,â said LukÃ¡shka, âor they will be killing some of us.
There behind that mound is a NogÃ¡y cart with a load of hay.â

The cornet listened to him and the corporal agreed. The cart of hay was
fetched, and the Cossacks, hiding behind it, pushed it forward. OlÃ©nin rode up
a hillock from whence he could see everything. The hay-cart moved on and the
Cossacks crowded together behind it. The Cossacks advanced, but the ChÃ©chens,
of whom there were nine, sat with their knees in a row and did not fire.

All was quiet. Suddenly from the ChÃ©chens arose the sound of a mournful song,
something like Daddy ErÃ³shkaâs âAy day, dalalay.â The ChÃ©chens knew that they
could not escape, and to prevent themselves from being tempted to take to
flight they had strapped themselves together, knee to knee, had got their guns
ready, and were singing their death-song.

The Cossacks with their hay-cart drew closer and closer, and OlÃ©nin expected
the firing to begin at any moment, but the silence was only broken by the

abreks
â mournful song. Suddenly the song ceased; there was a sharp
report, a bullet struck the front of the cart, and ChÃ©chen curses and yells
broke the silence and shot followed on shot and one bullet after another struck
the cart. The Cossacks did not fire and were now only five paces distant.

Another moment passed and the Cossacks with a whoop rushed out on both sides
from behind the cartâLukÃ¡shka in front of them. OlÃ©nin heard only a few shots,
then shouting and moans. He thought he saw smoke and blood, and abandoning his
horse and quite beside himself he ran towards the Cossacks. Horror seemed to
blind him. He could not make out anything, but understood that all was over.
LukÃ¡shka, pale as death, was holding a wounded ChÃ©chen by the arms and
shouting, âDonât kill him. Iâll take him alive!â The ChÃ©chen was the red-haired
man who had fetched his brotherâs body away after LukÃ¡shka had killed him.
LukÃ¡shka was twisting his arms. Suddenly the ChÃ©chen wrenched himself free and
fired his pistol. LukÃ¡shka fell, and blood began to flow from his stomach. He
jumped up, but fell again, swearing in Russian and in Tartar. More and more
blood appeared on his clothes and under him. Some Cossacks approached him and
began loosening his girdle. One of them, NazÃ¡rka, before beginning to help,
fumbled for some time, unable to put his sword in its sheath: it would not go
the right way. The blade of the sword was blood-stained.

The ChÃ©chens with their red hair and clipped moustaches lay dead and hacked
about. Only the one we know of, who had fired at LukÃ¡shka, though wounded in
many places was still alive. Like a wounded hawk all covered with blood (blood
was flowing from a wound under his right eye), pale and gloomy, he looked about
him with wide-open excited eyes and clenched teeth as he crouched, dagger in
hand, still prepared to defend himself. The cornet went up to him as if
intending to pass by, and with a quick movement shot him in the ear. The
ChÃ©chen started up, but it was too late, and he fell.

The Cossacks, quite out of breath, dragged the bodies aside and took the
weapons from them. Each of the red-haired ChÃ©chens had been a man, and each one
had his own individual expression. LukÃ¡shka was carried to the cart. He
continued to swear in Russian and in Tartar.

âNo fear, Iâll strangle him with my hands.
Anna seni!
â he cried,
struggling. But he soon became quiet from weakness.

OlÃ©nin rode home. In the evening he was told that LukÃ¡shka was at deathâs door,
but that a Tartar from beyond the river had undertaken to cure him with herbs.

The bodies were brought to the village office. The women and the little boys
hastened to look at them.

It was growing dark when OlÃ©nin returned, and he could not collect himself
after what he had seen. But towards night memories of the evening before came
rushing to his mind. He looked out of the window, MaryÃ¡nka was passing to and
fro from the house to the cowshed, putting things straight. Her mother had gone
to the vineyard and her father to the office. OlÃ©nin could not wait till she
had quite finished her work, but went out to meet her. She was in the hut
standing with her back towards him. OlÃ©nin thought she felt shy.

âMaryÃ¡nka,â said he, âI say, MaryÃ¡nka! May I come in?â

She suddenly turned. There was a scarcely perceptible trace of tears in her
eyes and her face was beautiful in its sadness. She looked at him in silent
dignity.

OlÃ©nin again said:

âMaryÃ¡nka, I have comeââ

âLeave me alone!â she said. Her face did not change but the tears ran down her
cheeks.

âWhat are you crying for? What is it?â

âWhat?â she repeated in a rough voice. âCossacks have been killed, thatâs what
for.â

âLukÃ¡shka?â said OlÃ©nin.

âGo away! What do you want?â

âMaryÃ¡nka!â said OlÃ©nin, approaching her.

âYou will never get anything from me!â

âMaryÃ¡nka, donât speak like that,â OlÃ©nin entreated.

âGet away. Iâm sick of you!â shouted the girl, stamping her foot, and moved
threateningly towards him. And her face expressed such abhorrence, such
contempt, and such anger that OlÃ©nin suddenly understood that there was no hope
for him, and that his first impression of this womanâs inaccessibility had been
perfectly correct.

OlÃ©nin said nothing more, but ran out of the hut.

Chapter XLII

For two hours after returning home he lay on his bed motionless. Then he went
to his company commander and obtained leave to visit the staff. Without taking
leave of anyone, and sending VanyÃºsha to settle his accounts with his landlord,
he prepared to leave for the fort where his regiment was stationed. Daddy
ErÃ³shka was the only one to see him off. They had a drink, and then a second,
and then yet another. Again as on the night of his departure from Moscow, a
three-horsed conveyance stood waiting at the door. But OlÃ©nin did not confer
with himself as he had done then, and did not say to himself that all he had
thought and done here was ânot itâ. He did not promise himself a new life. He
loved MaryÃ¡nka more than ever, and knew that he could never be loved by her.

âWell, good-bye, my lad!â said Daddy ErÃ³shka. âWhen you go on an expedition, be
wise and listen to my wordsâthe words of an old man. When you are out on a raid
or the like (you know Iâm an old wolf and have seen things), and when they
begin firing, donât get into a crowd where there are many men. When you fellows
get frightened you always try to get close together with a lot of others. You
think it is merrier to be with others, but thatâs where it is worst of all!
They always aim at a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and
went alone, and Iâve never been wounded. Yet what things havenât I seen in my
day?â

âBut youâve got a bullet in your back,â remarked VanyÃºsha, who was clearing up
the room.

âThat was the Cossacks fooling about,â answered ErÃ³shka.

âCossacks? How was that?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âOh, just so. We were drinking. VÃ¡nka SÃ­tkin, one of the Cossacks, got merry,
and puff! he gave me one from his pistol just here.â

âYes, and did it hurt?â asked OlÃ©nin. âVanyÃºsha, will you soon be ready?â he
added.

âAh, whereâs the hurry! Let me tell you. When he banged into me, the bullet did
not break the bone but remained here. And I say: âYouâve killed me, brother.
Eh! What have you done to me? I wonât let you off! Youâll have to stand me a
pailful!ââ

âWell, but did it hurt?â OlÃ©nin asked again, scarcely listening to the tale.

âLet me finish. He stood a pailful, and we drank it, but the blood went on
flowing. The whole room was drenched and covered with blood. Grandad BurlÃ¡k, he
says, âThe lad will give up the ghost. Stand a bottle of the sweet sort, or we
shall have you taken up!â They bought more drink, and boozed and boozedââ

âYes, but did it hurt you much?â OlÃ©nin asked once more.

âHurt, indeed! Donât interrupt: I donât like it. Let me finish. We boozed and
boozed till morning, and I fell asleep on the top of the oven, drunk. When I
woke in the morning I could not unbend myself anyhowââ

âWas it very painful?â repeated OlÃ©nin, thinking that now he would at last get
an answer to his question.

âDid I tell you it was painful? I did not say it was painful, but I could not
bend and could not walk.â

âAnd then it healed up?â said OlÃ©nin, not even laughing, so heavy was his
heart.

âIt healed up, but the bullet is still there. Just feel it!â And lifting his
shirt he showed his powerful back, where just near the bone a bullet could be
felt and rolled about.

âFeel how it rolls,â he said, evidently amusing himself with the bullet as with
a toy. âThere now, it has rolled to the back.â

âAnd LukÃ¡shka, will he recover?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âHeaven only knows! Thereâs no doctor. Theyâve gone for one.â

âWhere will they get one? From GrÃ³znoe?â asked OlÃ©nin.

âNo, my lad. Were I the Tsar Iâd have hung all your Russian doctors long ago.
Cutting is all they know! Thereâs our Cossack BaklÃ¡shka, no longer a real man
now that theyâve cut off his leg! That shows theyâre fools. Whatâs BaklÃ¡shka
good for now? No, my lad, in the mountains there are real doctors. There was my
chum, VÃ³rchik, he was on an expedition and was wounded just here in the chest.
Well, your doctors gave him up, but one of theirs came from the mountains and
cured him! They understand herbs, my lad!â

âCome, stop talking rubbish,â said OlÃ©nin. âIâd better send a doctor from
head-quarters.â

âRubbish!â the old man said mockingly. âFool, fool! Rubbish. Youâll send a
doctor!âIf yours cured people, Cossacks and ChÃ©chens would go to you for
treatment, but as it is your officers and colonels send to the mountains for
doctors. Yours are all humbugs, all humbugs.â

OlÃ©nin did not answer. He agreed only too fully that all was humbug in the
world in which he had lived and to which he was now returning.

âHow is LukÃ¡shka? Youâve been to see him?â he asked.

âHe just lies as if he were dead. He does not eat nor drink. Vodka is the only
thing his soul accepts. But as long as he drinks vodka itâs well. Iâd be sorry
to lose the lad. A fine ladâa brave, like me. I too lay dying like that once.
The old women were already wailing. My head was burning. They had already laid
me out under the holy icons. So I lay there, and above me on the oven little
drummers, no bigger than this, beat the tattoo. I shout at them and they drum
all the harder.â (The old man laughed.) âThe women brought our church elder.
They were getting ready to bury me. They said, âHe defiled himself with worldly
unbelievers; he made merry with women; he ruined people; he did not fast, and
he played the
balalÃ¡yka
. Confess,â they said. So I began to confess.
âIâve sinned!â I said. Whatever the priest said, I always answered âIâve
sinned.â He began to ask me about the
balalÃ¡yka
. âWhere is the accursed
thing,â he says. âShow it me and smash it.â But I say, âIâve not got it.â Iâd
hidden it myself in a net in the outhouse. I knew they could not find it. So
they left me. Yet after all I recovered. When I went for my

balalÃ¡yka
âWhat was I saying?â he continued. âListen to me, and keep
farther away from the other men or youâll get killed foolishly. I feel for you,
truly: you are a drinkerâI love you! And fellows like you like riding up the
mounds. There was one who lived here who had come from Russia, he always would
ride up the mounds (he called the mounds so funnily, âhillocksâ). Whenever he
saw a mound, off heâd gallop. Once he galloped off that way and rode to the top
quite pleased, but a ChÃ©chen fired at him and killed him! Ah, how well they
shoot from their gun-rests, those ChÃ©chens! Some of them shoot even better than
I do. I donât like it when a fellow gets killed so foolishly! Sometimes I used
to look at your soldiers and wonder at them. Thereâs foolishness for you! They
go, the poor fellows, all in a clump, and even sew red collars to their coats!
How can they help being hit! One gets killed, they drag him away and another
takes his place! What foolishness!â the old man repeated, shaking his head.
âWhy not scatter, and go one by one? So you just go like that and they wonât
notice you. Thatâs what you must do.â

âWell, thank you! Good-bye, Daddy. God willing we may meet again,â said OlÃ©nin,
getting up and moving towards the passage.

The old man, who was sitting on the floor, did not rise.

âIs that the way one says âGood-byeâ? Fool, fool!â he began. âOh dear, what has
come to people? Weâve kept company, kept company for well-nigh a year, and now
âGood-bye!â and off he goes! Why, I love you, and how I pity you! You are so
forlorn, always alone, always alone. Youâre somehow so unsociable. At times I
canât sleep for thinking about you. I am so sorry for you. As the song has it:

It is very hard, dear brother,

In a foreign land to live.

So it is with you.â

âWell, good-bye,â said OlÃ©nin again.

The old man rose and held out his hand. OlÃ©nin pressed it and turned to go.

âGive us your mug, your mug!â

And the old man took OlÃ©nin by the head with both hands and kissed him three
times with wet moustaches and lips, and began to cry.

âI love you, good-bye!â

OlÃ©nin got into the cart.

âWell, is that how youâre going? You might give me something for a remembrance.
Give me a gun! What do you want two for?â said the old man, sobbing quite
sincerely.

OlÃ©nin got out a musket and gave it to him.

âWhat a lot youâve given the old fellow,â murmured VanyÃºsha, âheâll never have
enough! A regular old beggar. They are all such irregular people,â he remarked,
as he wrapped himself in his overcoat and took his seat on the box.

âHold your tongue, swine!â exclaimed the old man, laughing. âWhat a stingy
fellow!â

MaryÃ¡nka came out of the cowshed, glanced indifferently at the cart, bowed and
went towards the hut.

â
La fille!
â said VanyÃºsha, with a wink, and burst out into a silly

âDrive on!â shouted OlÃ©nin, angrily.

âGood-bye, my lad! Good-bye. I wonât forget you!â shouted ErÃ³shka.

OlÃ©nin turned round. Daddy ErÃ³shka was talking to MaryÃ¡nka, evidently about his
own affairs, and neither the old man nor the girl looked at OlÃ©nin.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE.

This History of the doings of a Field Company of Australian
Engineers, this little book about a little unit in the Great War,
has been written of the Company, by the Company, for the
Company.

It lays no claim to interest the outsider, but does hope to
provide a framework on which the old member of the unit can
build up memories of his days in the field with the A.I.F. Memories
both grave and gay; mention of a dugout at so-and-so may
recall that the job cost the life of a mate; the name of a village
may raise a smile at the recollection of some good jest so likely
to be conceived when high-spirited men are gathered together.
The framework is admittedly bare, and the tale might have been
made much longer, but it is necessary to restrict the cost of
printing in order that the intention may be realised, of distributing
at the expense of regimental funds one copy to every man
whose name appears on the muster roll. The unit records show
the address of the next-of-kin in Australia of every man, and to
this address a copy is to be posted. The same considerations of
expense prevent the inclusion of maps, but it is hoped that almost
every home in Australia will possess a map of the war zone in
France, to which reference can be made.

HISTORY OF THE
11th
FIELD COMPANY

AUSTRALIAN ENGINEERS.

CHAPTER
I.

EARLY DAYS.

1.
Australia, England, and France.

The Company was formed in Australia, Headquarters and

Nos.
1 and 2 sections being raised in the Fourth Military District,
and two sections in the First Military District. Selection of
personnel commenced in the beginning of March, 1916, but
Officers had previously been selected and trained at the Engineer
Officersâ Training School, Sydney. The O.C. (Captain R. J.
Donaldson), 2nd in command (
Lieut.
O. B. Williams), and a
number of N.C.O.âs and men came from the 12th Field Company
A.E., C.M.F., at Broken Hill; 2nd-
Lieut.
J. M. Norton from the
11th Field
Coy.
, A.E., C.M.F. (Adelaide); while 2nd-
Lieut.
S.
W. Matters came from South Australia, and 2nd-Lieuts. R. W.
Lahey and H. St. A. Murray, from Queensland.

The quotas were collected and trained separately, that from
South Australia at Mitcham Camp, near Adelaide, and the
Queensland sections at Enoggera, near Brisbane, until 29th April,
1916, when the Company concentrated at Mitcham. Work was
then carried on with the full Company, at the same time stores
and equipment were slowly collected. Horses were issued from
the remount depÃ´t, not for overseas service but for training purposes,
but proved so wild as to give the drivers more practice in
colt-breaking and riding buck jumpers than in the routine of
military horse mastership and drill.

The technical stores of a Field Company are very extensive,
but by ransacking Adelaide warehouses to fill the gaps in the
available army supplies, Ordnance succeeded in almost completing
the equipment. Two tool carts came from 12th Field Company,
C.M.F., at Broken Hill (afterwards re-numbered the 11th),
and one from a Queensland Field
Coy.
The pontoons were made
at Cockatoo Docks in New South Wales, but the Weldon trestles,
bridging wagons, and water cart were not ready in time. The
Sappers were issued with green leather infantry equipment, but

Pg 8

this was afterwards changed in England for web. No rifles were
issued until the unit reached England.

Embarkation took place at Outer Harbour (Adelaide) on
31st May, 1916, on H.M.A.T. A 29, s.s. âSuevic,â in company
with the 11th Field Ambulance (
Lieut.
-Col. Downey).

After a rough trip round the Lleuwin the âSuevicâ arrived
at Fremantle on 6th June, 1916, and embarked the 44th Battalion
(
Lieut.
-Col. Mansbridge, D.S.O., who became C.O. troops).

Crossing the Indian Ocean the vessel sprung a small leak
which necessitated calling at Durban for the services of a diver.
The stay was only twenty-four hours (21st June, 1916), but the
troops had a route march through the town.

Cape Town was reached on 24th June, 1916, and left on 27th.
As was expected the yellow flag was flown and no leave was
granted, but the troops had a route march and a sports meeting.

The next port of call was St. Vincent, reached on the 11th
July, 1916. No one was allowed on shore. The run from here
was through the submarine zone, and was attended with the
usual discomforts. The pontoons of the Company first saw
service being installed on the boat deck as emergency lifeboats.

Finally, after a long voyage, during which there was a considerable
amount of sickness and the death of one member of
the unit, disembarkation took place on July 21st, 1916, at
Plymouth. The unit entrained to Amesbury and marched to
Camp 20, Lark Hill, Salisbury Plains, joining up with the
3rd

Australian Division, then slowly concentrating. The Company
was the first of the Divisional Engineers to arrive, and at once
came under the orders of
Lieut.
-Col. H. O. Clogstoun, R.E.,
C.R.E., of the division.

Before commencing training, the members of the unit
received four daysâ disembarkation leave, which was keenly
enjoyed after the confinement and discomfort of the troopship.
Work had barely started at Lark Hill before orders were received
to proceed to Brightlingsea, in Essex, for pontoon training, in
the Engineer depÃ´t there. No camp being available, all ranks
were billeted on the townspeople, and were the first Australians
to visit the place. Some surprise was expressed at the lightness
of complexion and English speech of the visitors, and both the
military authorities and the townspeople were agreeably surprised
to find that their lives and property were not appreciably jeopardised
by the wild Colonial soldiery.

The visit, originally intended to last only until efficiency had
been reached in pontooning, was afterwards extended to include
a full course of R.E. training, and some work on the East Coast
defences, and it was not until two months had elapsed that the
Company rejoined the Division at Lark Hill.

The unit took part in two sports meetings at Brightlingsea.
In the first it was beaten by a Highland Field Company, R.E.,

Pg 9

stationed in the town, and in the second carried off a silver cup
in competition with the local Naval Forces and with the 10th
Field Company, which had arrived for training.

After the return to the division at Lark Hill, training in field
works in conjunction with infantry was undertaken; the trench
system at Bustard will always be remembered by the original
members of the unit. A specially interesting exercise was a
route march, under tactical conditions, lasting five days, from
Lark Hill, through Chitterne, Westbury, Devizes, Pusey, and
back to camp.

Another interesting experience was a fifteen-mile route march
of the whole division with full transport. On another occasion,
officers and senior N.C.O.âs took part in a divisional tactical
exercise, which was memorable chiefly for the coldness of the
wind, which preluded a fall of snow—the first many members
of the Company had seen.

Equipment was completed in every respect at Lark Hill, and
horses and mules âtaken on strength.â On the 24th November,
1916, after three months in England, the unit left for France
with the
3rd
Division, going by train to Southampton, and
embarking there on the B.I., s.s. âNirvana,â which reached Le
Havre next morning. In pouring rain the company marched to
the wretched Docks âRestâ Camp and distributed itself among
sodden tents, thoroughly wet and uncomfortable. The field
rations were first encountered in this camp, and the Sappers
often laughed afterwards at memories of their eager search for
pork in the first tins of pork and beans. The march to the railway
station on the evening of the 26th was interrupted by numerous
long and exasperating delays; the entraining arrangements were
bad, and the journey by train very cold, and so much longer
than was anticipated, that food supplies left much to be desired.

It was not until noon on the 28th that Bailleul was reached.
From there the unit proceeded at once to billets at Bleu near
Vieux Berquin, the transport by route march, and the Sappers
in grey-painted disreputable London âbuses.

The exposure and discomfort involved in these first adventures
in France—which contrasted so strongly with the expeditious
and altogether excellent arrangements on the other side
of the Channel—resulted in a good deal of illhealth in the unit,
and when on the 30th a move was made to Steenwerck, where
Divisional Headquarters had been established, a number of men
were suffering from bronchitis and similar troubles.

On the
3rd
December, Company Headquarters and
Nos.
3
and 4 sections moved into ArmentiÃ¨res, and billeted in the tram
sheds at LâAttargette, but
Nos.
1 and 2 remained with the transport
in the Steenwerck area, and were kept busy on hutments
and stables for the division for some little time longer.

Pg 10

2.
ArmentiÃ¨res.

When the
3rd
Australian Division first went into the line
east of ArmentiÃ¨res, the 9th Brigade took over the right or
LâEpinette sector astride the Lille railway, while the 10th Brigade
was on the left or Houplines sector. The 11th Brigade was in
reserve, and with it the 11th Field Company, which took over
from the New Zealand Engineers of âFranks Forceâ the care of
the Lys River bridges and also various jobs for the artillery covering
the divisional front.

The billets in the town were a great improvement on the
dilapidated, damp, and entirely filthy hutments taken over by
the division around Steenwerck. The mud around the stables and
horse standings in the area was quite appalling, and the transport
had no relief until the famous frost of the winter â16-17 descended
on the land and made all clean and dry for a time.

The tramway sheds at LâAttargette, on the northern outskirts
of the town, contained a number of cars, which were fitted up by
the men of 3 and 4 sections as cubicles. Headquarters was
established in the tramway offices, and when
Nos.
1 and 2 sections
joined up some two or three weeks later they found quite good
quarters in the neighbouring Rue de Flandres.

All the existing bridges over the river Lys around ArmentiÃ¨res
and Houplines had been prepared for demolition, but
charges, fittings, and magazines all required a great deal of work.

A number of emergency floating bridges—both pontoon and
barrel pier—also required attention and repairs. To facilitate
bridge inspection
No.
4 section built a rowing boat. Another
little job was the construction from salvaged material of a spring
cart, which accompanied the unit in all its subsequent wanderings,
and was always known as the Souvenir Cart.

Work for the artillery consisted in the construction of O.P.âs
and of gunpits among the ruins of Houplines and the outskirts of
the town.
Lieut.
R. W. Lahey was wounded in the head by
shrapnel while on this work and evacuated, but returned to the
unit shortly afterwards.

The 11th Brigade relieved the 9th Brigade on the 24th
December, and at the same time the 11th Field Company took
over from the 9th, after spending several days in acquiring knowledge
of the trenches.
Nos.
1 and 2 sections had previously
moved to ArmentiÃ¨res. Very vigorous work on trench improvements
was at once commenced and an extraordinary amount
accomplished. In spite of the unfavourable weather large
numbers of dugouts for the accommodation of the garrisons were
built, new communication trenches dug, barbed wire put up,
and the drainage of the trench system greatly improved. Material
was used in vast quantities—sandbags literally by the million,
âAâ frames, revetting material, duckboards, steel trench shelters,
corrugated iron. All this had to be carted to the forward dumps,

Pg 11

âTissage Dump,â at Houplines, and âFochaber,â near Chapelle
dâArmentiÃ¨res, and night after night, for nearly three months,
every available vehicle of the Company transport made at least
one journey, without incurring a single casualty to man or beast.

The first member of the unit to lose his life in action was
Sapper Dahl, of
No.
3 section, killed by a shell in the support
line on Christmas Eve.

Christmas Day was spent the same as any other day of the
period, hard at work in the line. Shortly afterwards the frosty
weather commenced, which was to make this winter the coldest
known for many years. The Lys river froze over so completely
that it could be crossed by troops in fours and by horses and
wagons; the soil was frozen as hard as iron to such a depth as to
almost preclude any digging; and the very breath congealed upon
the faces of those who wore moustaches. Still the work went
on, albeit more slowly, and the weather at least gave
No.
2, the
drainage section, some respite from their labours.

The clothing issued by Ordnance helped all ranks to withstand
the unaccustomed rigours of such a climate. Warm underclothing,
extra socks, worsted gloves, and fingerless gloves of
sheepskin were all appreciated, but the most useful âissueâ was
a sleeveless jerkin of leather, lined with flannel or something of
the sort and worn over the tunic. This garment was extremely
popular, as it kept the body warm, shed rain or snow, and did
not interfere with the use of the arms.

The active service rations, too, were much better than the
unit had been accustomed to in England. The only serious shortage
was that of fuel, but of course in a shell-torn country-side
there were ways and means of improving the supply.

At this time ArmentiÃ¨res sheltered quite a large civilian
population; Estaminets, cafÃ©s, and shops were numerous; and it
was very strange to see the business of the town carried on so
calmly within easy range of the enemyâs guns. It was quite the
usual thing to have a cup of afternoon tea or a glass of beer in
a cafÃ© on return from the line, or to buy the daily papers (including
an occasional âLa Vie Parisienneâ) at the little shop at the
Five Corners.

The proceedings in the trenches themselves were characterised
by a certain amount of regularity. The hour of our daily
artillery and trench mortar âstrafeâ was advertised beforehand
to all concerned, except (we hoped) the Boche, and the garrison
and working parties were largely cleared in time from the front
line and tucked away in some spot sheltered from the enemy
retaliation. The numerous raids by both sides were the chief
cause of casualties, and the occasional intense Minenwerfer
barrages put down by the enemy did a lot of damage to our
trenches, besides causing loss of life. The âtrenchesâ were
really in most places breastworks built up above the level of

Pg 12

the flat and ill-drained country, and were very susceptible to
damage from shell fire, and required much labour to repair.

The whole system of defence works in the Brigade area was
carefully surveyed by the Company Surveyors, and a remarkable
map produced, to a scale of 1 to 2,500. While engaged on this
work one of the surveyors was arrested by some suspicious
infantrymen and his section sergeant had some trouble in persuading
them that they had not caught a spy at last.

Spy hunting was very popular, as it was firmly believed that
whoever caught a real one would receive a sum of money and
be granted a fortnightâs leave!

3.
Messines Preparations.

The Company left ArmentiÃ¨res (which was, however, still
held by the
3rd
Division) on March 14th, when it crossed the
river and commenced working in the Le Touquet sector, the
defence of which was taken over at the same time by the 11th
Brigade. The whole company, including transport, concentrated
in Stuff Camp, Pont de Nieppe, which was taken over from the
New Zealand Engineers.

The Le Touquet sector was chiefly distinguished by drainage
difficulties, and time did not permit of much improvement being
effected, as on the 5th April the area including PlÅgsteert Wood
and St. Ives Hill was taken over and work started on preparation
for the attack on Messines Ridge—the so-called âMagnum Opus.â
The 105th Field
Coy.
, R.E., took charge of the Le Touquet area
on the 7th, leaving the 11th
Coy.
free to devote all its time to
Messines preparations.

These included a big programme of trench improvements
and extensions and Battalion Headquarters for the various
attacking battalions, well forward in our existing trenches. The
Battalion Headquarters were made of concrete, chiefly in the
form of blocks and steel girders and rails. The block construction
was not very successful.

As the 9th and 10th were to be the attacking Brigades, and
the 9th & 10th Companies to be associated with them, these two
Field Companies took over all these works from the 11th Field
Company about 26th April, leaving the 11th free to devote itself
to such work as the preparation of approach routes up to and
through PlÅgsteert Wood, signboards and fixed maps throughout
the area, and further accommodation for various headquarters
and command posts. Two sections—1 and 4—were taken up with
artillery work—preparing the positions for the field artillery to
be used in the attack; acres of camouflage screen were erected
over battery positions, scores of splinter-proof shelters made for
the gun crews, gun pits dug out and protected, and tram lines
laid. A very strong dugout for use as a Divisional Command
Post was made in the cellars of the lodge on the road from Hyde

Pg 13

Park Corner to Messines, and a great deal of work was done fixing
up the âCatacombs.â This was a very large dugout in Hill 63,
dug some time before by the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company.
It was big enough to hold some 1,400 men, but had been allowed
to become rather dilapidated. It was cleaned out and improved
in various ways so as to accommodate a Brigade Headquarters,
Battalion Headquarters, and a battalion complete, together with
a few stray detachments.

The âfixed mapsâ already mentioned consisted of small
maps, done in waterproof ink on linen and varnished on to boards,
erected in correct orientation at trench intersections, road and
track junctions, and all such places throughout the divisional area.
They proved of great use, particularly to the numerous strangers
which the approaching battle brought into the area. Another
job of the Company Surveyors was a relief map or model of the
battle area. This was carved out of wood to a scale of 1.2500
horizontal and 1.400 vertical, and shewed everything known of
the enemyâs lines in great detail. It was used throughout the
battle by the 11th A.I. Brigade in their headquarters in the
Catacombs, and was subsequently sent to Australia.

Dumps of Engineer stores for use during and after the battle
were gradually built up in various forward positions, particularly
in the north-east part of PlÅgsteert Wood. One of these dumps
in the wood was shelled one day and a sapper of the company,
a tough old veteran of the South African Campaign, was hit in
the leg by a splinter. He started to hobble down the duckboards
towards an aid post, but after proceeding a hundred yards or so
his indignation overcame him, and returning to the dump, he
demanded his rifle in a voice choked with anger, saying, âIâll
make the —— pay for this!â It was with some difficulty that
the old warrior was smoothed down and started afresh for the
aid post.

Lieut.
W. H. Thomas was in charge of the dumps during
both the preparations and the battle itself, and he and his party
of sappers and attached infantry had a bad time from gas, which
was used in shells very largely by the enemy at this time,
PlÅgsteert Wood, in particular, being drenched with it immediately
before and during the attack.

For his work during the period,
Lieut.
Thomas subsequently
received the Military Cross, but was evacuated suffering from
gas shortly after the action.

The increasing rain of shells of all calibre which was poured
on the enemy defences in preparation for the battle, provoked
heavy shelling in reply, particularly counter battery work, and
while Messines village could be noticed visibly dwindling under
the fire of our heavies, many farmhouses on our side of the line,
which had hitherto escaped, were battered to pieces. PlÅgsteert
Wood, with its clean duckboard tracks and rustic cabins, was no

Pg 14

longer a suitable spot to study the phenomena of spring. The scent
of the violet became lost in the odour of lachrymatory gas, and
the note of the cuckoo, while still to be heard, alternated with
the whistle and the crash of shells. Pont de Nieppe and its
vicinity were shelled on two or three occasions, and on June 6th,
the day before the battle, the company lost four men killed and
three wounded in Stuff Camp itself.

Some little time before this the enemy had fired a few shells
at the bridge itself, the Pont de Nieppe, on the main road into
ArmentiÃ¨res, and had succeeded in putting one shell through
what appeared to be the crown of the arch. In reality, the arch
had no proper crown, the central 23 feet or so of the span being
bridged across by girders connected with brick jack arches. From
underneath these girders looked like, and had always been taken
for, steel, but the shell, which broke three of them, disclosed the
interesting fact that they were only of cast iron. While just
strong enough to take 3-ton motor lorries, there was certainly
not sufficient margin of safety for heavier loads. The damage
was repaired and the bridge incidentally strengthened by a party
of sappers from the company, who stripped the damaged portion
and replaced the broken cast iron beams with steel girders.
These had to be slowly and painfully shaped by hand to fit exactly
to the cast iron seating at each end.

Part of the medical arrangements were carried out by the
11th Company, who built an R.A.P. near Hyde Park Corner and
some extensions to other posts and dressing stations.

Early in June the elaborate preparations were at last complete,
and Z day was fixed for the 7th of the month. The
3rd

Australian Division had reached the eve of its first large scale
offensive.

CHAPTER
II.

MESSINES, YPRES, AND AFTER.

1.
The Battle of Messines.

The 11th Field Company was reserve company in the first
stage of the attack on Messines Ridge, and very early in the
morning of the 7th of June, 1917, marched from Pont de Nieppe
to Weka Lines, in the little village of Romarin, on the road to
PlÅgsteert village. With the company moved a party of attached
infantry from the 9th Brigade, which had reported to Stuff Camp
some days previously. The morning was still and warm and
there was a good deal of gas about the battery areas, so that part
of the march was done in gas masks, and until the sun rose all
ranks solemnly sat around the camp wearing them.

The attack opened at dawn, but the company saw little of
the actual progress of events until the 9th, when the unit moved
into Bunhill Row, in PlÅgsteert Wood, and relieved the 10th Field
Company, A.E. The company bivouac was shelled and gassed
heavily all the first night, casualties being three killed and four
wounded. Work was started immediately in the battle area
north of the River Douve, and every effort was made to improve
the communications through the âCrater Fieldsâ in order to
facilitate the advance of the 11th A.I.
Bde.
, which had relieved
the 10th A.I.
Bde.
in this area, and experienced hard fighting in
advancing to the âGreen Line,â and afterwards holding it.
Enemy shelling was heavy, but the unit was fortunate enough
to escape with very light casualties. During one heavy burst
of shelling, two sections of the company sheltered in the same
trench as a company of infantry; the infantry suffered 23 casualties,
while the sappers escaped unhurt.

A special feature of the arrangements for the attack was the
organisation of a divisional pack train for the transport of
ammunition, food, water, and R.E. stores to the newly-captured
areas. The company contributed a considerable number of
drivers and mules under
Lieut.
J. M. Norton, to this train.

Pack mules were very successfully used independently by
the company a little later for transport to forward jobs. Driver
A. A. Paget received the M.M. for good work with the pack train,
while 2nd Corpl. C. C. Jones and Lance-Corpl. W. W. Evans were
similarly rewarded for devotion to duty with the sappers.

Pg 16

On 12th June the company moved to La Boudrelle, south of
Steenwerck, a most delightful place after the battle area, but on
the 15th started work on the so-called Black Line, south of the
River Douve, in the vicinity of Grey Farm. On the 20th this
work was handed over to the New Zealand Engineers, and the
company marched on the 21st to Neuve Eglise (camp at Stampkotmolen).

On the
23rd
, the Messines sector was taken over from the
25th Division and the company started work with the 11th A.I.
Brigade, which was holding the forward system on the whole
divisional front from the River Douve to the Blaupoortbeek. A
very strenuous time ensued until July 11th, the infantry of the
Brigade carrying out a vigorous policy involving pushing the lines
forward and an enormous amount of digging, under bad weather
conditions, and consistently heavy enemy artillery fire. The
sappers, in addition to marking out much of the new trench
system and working in the trenches themselves, sank several
wells, repaired concrete dugouts, and improvised new shelters,
erected signboards, and made reconnaissances and maps. Ferme
de la Croix and Pine Avenue, Steignast Farm and Gapaard, will
always be remembered in connection with this period, âthe 19
days.â

After relief by the 9th Field Company, the company had a
few days training at Neuve Eglise, and then marched to La
Boudrelle for pontooning on the Lys. While at La Boudrelle a
very successful sports meeting was held. The unit then returned
to Neuve Eglise and took part in the Windmill battle of July
31st. The preparations for this will be remembered as a rush
job at the eleventh hour. It was about this time that night
bombing by enemy aircraft first became troublesome.

La Boudrelle was visited for the third time on the 15th, the
division being in support, and work was started roofing in the big
ammunition dump at La Creche, but before the task could be
completed, the unit moved with the division to 2nd Army Training
Area, south-west of St. Omer.

Divisional Headquarters was established at Fauquembergues,
and the 11th Field Company in the little village of
RecquebrÅucq on the River Aa.

2.
A Share in the
3rd
Battle of Ypres.

The visit to the training area was for the purpose of resting,
training, and re-fitting, in preparation for more strenuous days
to come; and lasted until September 25th. This was a very
delightful period, the accommodation for all ranks being good,
the country people very kindly, and the weather favourable.
Opportunities for training were also good, and the unit was in a
very good state when it started marching northward with the
division on September 25th, to take part in the Third Battle of
Ypres.

Pg 17

Before leaving the training area the company attended two
noteworthy parades, one on the 19th September, when the Divisional
Engineers assembled with full transport, and carried out
evolutions under the C.R.E., and another on the 22nd, when
the whole of the
3rd
Division, less artillery and transport, was
inspected by the Commander-in-Chief, F.-M. Sir Douglas Haig.

The march northwards with the 11th A.I. Brigade Group
was viÃ¢ Blaringhem, Eecke and Poperinghe, to Ypres, which was
reached on the 30th September. The company took over from
the 529th Field Company, R.E. (
3rd
British Division) and billeted
in cellars and shelters among the ruins just south of the prison.
The horse lines were at Brandhoek, with, later, an advanced camp
east of Ypres.

The night of the harvest moon at Poperinghe will always be
remembered for a remarkable display of bombing by enemy
aeroplanes. Uncomfortable as the situation was for troops
crowded in tents, some amusement was to be derived from the
efforts of certain machine guns, which, chattering hysterically
whenever a Boche âplane was caught in the beam of a searchlight,
threw streams of tracer bullets at a target some thousands of
yards out of range. No doubt it relieved the gunnersâ feelings.

The great British offensive in the Ypres salient, to which the
capture of the Messines ridge had been a prelude, had opened
on July 31st, when the
3rd
Australian Division captured âThe
Windmillâ on the extreme south flank of the battle. After some
pauses and delays, it was now, in the late autumn of 1917, in full
swing. A constant succession of heavy, but comparatively shallow
pushes, it might almost be called the Battle of the Roads, so
much did the impetus of the attack depend on the use of the
highways converging on the ruined town, and so enormous and
impressive was the congestion of road traffic. The great road
from Poperinghe to Ypres was covered day and night with streams
of everything on wheels or feet which went to make or help an
army, all dribbling in clouds of dust and profanity through the
bottle-neck at Vlamertinghe. On the enemy side of Ypres the
road best known to the
3rd
Division was that which led to Zonnebeke.
Here the congestion of traffic was complicated by the
insistent attentions of the enemy artillery, which periodically
pitted the route with shell holes and left the roadside littered
with dead horses and broken vehicles, and sometimes with more
dreadful wreckage.

Besides the limbers taking ammunition to the nearer guns,
ration limbers and wagons laden with Engineer stores, the forward
road was thronged with pack animals, which in hundreds
carried ammunition to the less accessible batteries. On the
outward journey they were led by dogged men on foot; returning
light with the men in the saddle, the cavalcade stood not upon
the order of its going, and no matter the rank of the pedestrian,

Pg 18

he unhesitatingly gave it the road. Particularly after the rain
came was the road past Mill Cot to Kink Dump, Devils Crossing,
and Zonnebeke, a place of evil memory.

For three weeks the company, working from Ypres, was
continuously employed in the battle area in the divisional sector
north of the Zonnebeke Railway. The
3rd
Australian Division
delivered a very successful attack on October 4th, when the
Broodseinde Ridge was captured. When it was relieved by the
66th Division, the company remained in the area working with
this division until after its attack of October 9th. The
3rd

Division then returned to the line and advanced again on October
12th.

Early in the month the weather broke and torrents of rain
converted the shell-torn earth into a dreadful quagmire. Tracks
across the wilderness of mud and shell holes had to be reconnoitred,
marked out and duckboarded wherever possible; roads
patched up to carry the guns. The tracks were all marked by
distinctive letters or names; two well-remembered ones were
Jack and Jill. Strange materials were used for road making;
the dead body of a mule or two might be seen tumbled into a
shell hole and covered with the smashed up remains of some
vehicle. Piles of shells were known to be used in emergency to
hurriedly fill a hole in some urgently required roadway. Causeways
were built for mules and men across the bog which marked
the original course of the Zonnebeke stream, and many concrete
dugouts repaired and made habitable. On all these arduous tasks
the company was engaged and suffered a steady drain of
casualties.

Under these conditions the possession of ample comforts
funds, supplied chiefly by friends in Australia, contributed considerably
to the comfort and efficiency of the unit, as it rendered
possible the supply of hot drinks and food at all hours to the
different parties, and of emergency chocolate rations to parties on
exposed work.

Worthy of special note during this period was the work done
by
Lieut.
J. M. Norton and a small party of surveyors in laying
down an elaborate system of jumping-off tapes for the attack
of October 4th, and a similar task carried out by
Lieut.
S. W.
Matters previous to the attack of October 9th. On the 4th,
Lieut.

H. St. A. Murray and a party of sappers and attached infantry
(the 11th A.T. Brigade had supplied a permanent working party
of three officers and 100 other ranks who lived and worked with
the company) pushed forward on the top of the Broodseinde
Ridge immediately behind the attacking infantry, and dug and
wired a number of strong points. The transport, both pack and
wheeled, carried out very difficult and dangerous tasks under
Captain O. B. Williams and
Lieut.
W. H. Thomas, M.C., and
the work of the surveyors was also particularly arduous and

Pg 19

valuable.
Lieut.
H. St. A. Murray received the Military Cross,
2nd Corpl. C. P. Atkins the Meritorious Service Medal, and 2nd
Corpl. A. M. Stewart, 2nd Corpl. J. J. Mace, Lance-Corpl. W.
G. Toft, Driver A. H. Furniss, and Sapper F. G. Bugden, the
Military Medal.

3.
Revisiting Old Haunts.

On being relieved in Ypres by the 12th Canadian Field Company
Engineers, the company moved on the 22nd of October back
to RecquebrÅucq (dismounted by train, transport by road), and
rested and re-fitted until 12th November, 1917, when the division
once more went into the line, in Flanders, re-visiting one of its
old haunts in the Le Touquet—Pont Rouge and Warneton sectors,
taking over from the 8th British Division.

The 11th Field Company A.E. was placed in reserve, took
over a camp near Wulverghem (28 T.10.a.5, 9), and commenced
work on pipe burying, artillery positions, drainage, and the like.
Regular winter warfare conditions commenced, and much useful
work was effected.

While the company was in Wulverghem Camp (which by the
way, the sappers scornfully christened âGutza Camp,â from its
forlorn appearance, but which proved not so uncomfortable)
several daylight bombing raids by enemy aeroplanes in force took
place, and on one occasion the company suffered the loss of Corpl.
Gray, killed, and C.-S.-M. Brander seriously wounded.

After a month in the line, the division was relieved by the
2nd Australian Division, and went into Corps reserve, with headquarters
at Meteren, and the 11th Field Company, A.E., moved
into Mahutonga Camp, on Waterloo Road, near Neuve Eglise.
A programme of training was commenced, but most of the available
strength was soon absorbed on various back areas works, and
finally the division somewhat unexpectedly took over the ArmentiÃ¨res
sector from the 38th (Welsh) Division. This unit went into
the line with the 11th A.I. Brigade on the right, and billeted in
the big jute factory near the emergency bridge over the Lys, on
the outskirts of ArmentiÃ¨res.

As usual, there was no lack of work for the sappers. The
trench system required a great deal of development, particularly
with a view to a step by step defence in depth, and a number of
dugout jobs were taken over from the 38th Division. Lys river
bridges again came under the companyâs care, but on a stretch
of the river a little south of the crossings familiar during the
previous winter. Charges had to be overhauled, leads repaired
and tested, magazines rebuilt.

The billets were comfortable, but, as usual, throughout the
cold weather, the fuel supply was a âburningâ problem. In the
jute factory it was not incapable of solution, as alongside the
boiler house there were a large number of coal heaps. These

Pg 20

were watched over by the factory caretaker and liberally placarded
with notices, âNot to be touched,â but if each sapper in a section
moving from cookhouse to billets casually picked up a lump of
coal, the section stove need never go cold.

A holiday from the line work was granted on Christmas Day,
and full advantage was taken of it for seasonable feasting. The
officers and sergeants, who attended first their section dinners,
and afterwards the meals in their own messes, had rather a trying
day.

The town of ArmentiÃ¨res was much changed since the previous
visit. With the exception of a few caretakers, all the
inhabitants had gone, and dreadful tales were told of their
experiences when the Boche shelled the place heavily with high
explosive and gas about the time of the Messines Battle.

The stay in this sector was quite short, the 57th Division
(British) relieving the
3rd
Australian Division on
3rd
January,
1918, the 11th Field Company, A.E., returning to Mahutonga
Camp.

The next move was into the Le Touquet—Pont Rouge sector
with the 11th A.I. Brigade, the 11th Field Co., A.E., taking over
from the 5th Field
Coy.
, A.E., 2nd Australian Division, on 31st
January, 1918.

With the help of a permanent working party from the 11th
A.I.
Bde.
, great progress was made in improving the drainage and
the whole system of defences of the area. The Company lived
very comfortably in the familiar Weka Lines at Romarin, with
the transport in the same camp. The wagons had a busy time
on this sector and delivered large amounts of material to the
dumps at Motor Car Corner and Le Gheer. The old German
system of trenches west of the river, which had sheltered the
enemy during the Companyâs tenancy of this sector the previous
spring, were now occupied by us and were very little damaged,
having been quietly evacuated by the Boche after Messines. It
was very interesting to study his methods, and the concrete dugouts
in particular were a monument to his industry. In less
then 3,000 yards of line, in the front and support trenches alone—i.e.,
in a strip of country not more then 300 yards deep—there
were found over 70 concrete dugouts and shelters. Many were
small, but the smallest involved a great deal of labour in this
exposed and water-logged region.

The
3rd
Australian Division was now due for its turn in the
training area and was relieved by the 2nd Australian Division on
March
3rd
.

The 5th Field Company took over Weka Lines and the sector
from the 11th, which moved by train and road for dismounted
personnel and transport respectively, to Bainghem-le-Comte,
about 14 miles from Boulogne.

CHAPTER
III.

THE DEFENCE OF AMIENS.

âEvery position should be strengthened as far as time
admits with the object of reducing the number of men required
to hold it, and of thereby adding to the strength of the general
reserve.â

Field Service Regulations.

1.
The Move.

The month of March, 1918, found the
3rd
Australian Division
enjoying a well-earned rest in billets between St. Omer and
Boulogne. Every division considers its every rest well earned,
but after the long winter in the line on the Belgian border with
even its turn in reserve broken by an excursion to the old trenches
south of ArmentiÃ¨res, the
3rd
had settled down with a particularly
comfortable feeling of conscious rectitude.

The 11th Field Company had reached its obscure little village
of Bainghem-le-Comte on March 6th, and by the middle of the
month was comfortable, judging comfort by the standard of
soldiers in the field, to whom a rude bunk of saplings in a reasonably
weatherproof barn, with a tin can stove, represent the best
which can be hoped for. Spring came early; on southward hillsides
the sun shone warm at noon, and not even a bomb disturbed
either work or play.

Then came the German offensive, of which the first hint was
the ugly throbbing of distant heavy gunfire. At short notice the
division commenced to move, and the dismounted portion of the
company entrained on the 22nd at Lottingen and Desvres, while
the transport under
Lieut.
Rutledge took to the road.

In the strenuous pilgrimage of the next few days, the first
stage was towards the north; detraining at Caestre (north of
Hazebrouck) the company marched to Eecke (night of 22nd-
23rd
).
Then on the 24th the direction was reversed, and by
march and motor âbus it moved to Wardrecques, east of St. Omer.
Meanwhile the transport had moved to Esquerdes, and thence to
Renescure, and on the 24th rejoined the company, and the whole
proceeded to a thorough overhaul of all stores and equipment,
and the rigorous discarding of all non-essentials.

The news from the battle area in the south came through in
brief outline in rare newspapers and much more vividly by word

Pg 22

of mouth, in startling rumours; but all of it was serious. Nevertheless
the general feeling was one of relief, almost of elation;
the long-talked enemy blow had fallen and we were to help the
counter-stroke which all were convinced must sooner or later be
delivered. The war-like activity in all this familiar region behind
the Flanders front was sufficiently exhilarating in itself. In
addition to the
3rd
Australian, the New Zealand and the 4th
Australian Divisions were on the move. Battalions marched and
counter-marched across the country with bands playing in the thin
sunshine, and the pavÃ© roads literally swayed under the torrent
of motor lorries and âbuses. Such animation in the war country
is always accompanied by one or other of the twin banes of the
foot soldier, mud or dust; on this occasion cold clouds of the latter
added to the joys of âfull marching order with blankets.â

Very early in the cold and frosty morning of the 26th the
company moved again, all tuned up in readiness for that open
warfare which we were expected to experience. As throughout
the whole move it came under the orders of the 11th Brigade
Group, and was commanded by
Capt.
O. B. Williams, the O.C.,
Major R. J. Donaldson being acting C.R.E.

After something more than the usual delays, entrainment
took place at Arques, including transport, about three p.m.
Detrainment was at Doullens, and took place at 12.30 next morning,
after several hours in the train waiting just outside the
station, while Boche planes energetically bombed the neighbourhood.
From Doullens the company marched at once some six
miles to Thievres, where the sappers were picked up by motor
âbuses and taken to Franvillers, between Amiens and Albert, debussing
at 7 a.m. The long wait at Arques, and again at Doullens,
the toilsome march to Thievres, and the bitterly cold âbus ride
(for the morning of March 27th deserves to be remembered for
its searching wind alone), all combined with the absence of hot
food and drink to make the journey one of the most arduous in
the history of the unit.

But the scenes on the road that bleak March morning were
enough to stir the thinnest blood. The pitiful flight of a civilian
population before an advancing enemy has often been described;
it is enough to say that to all ranks first came a full understanding
of war and a common anger against the enemy. Also there
came no little pride of country, so extreme was the relief with
which the people welcomed the arrival of âles Australiens.â

A halt at Franvillers allowed of the preparation of welcome
food, and even more welcome hot drink. Meanwhile, the transport,
after a cold and foodless all night march, arrived and established
itself in a little wood west of the village. Early in the afternoon
Company Headquarters and 1, 3, and 4 sections moved on again
a short distance to Heilly, on the river Ancre, and chose billets
among the deserted houses.

Pg 23

The
3rd
Australian Division had now arrived in the Somme
country and there was much satisfaction in the knowledge. Just
as in Australia no miner can claim to have travelled unless he has
been to Moonta, so no good Australian knew anything of war
until he had been âon the Somme.â The sapperâs eye saw other
causes for satisfaction; the steep dry banks invited the dugout
builder, and the streams wanting bridges, and the bridges wanting
demolition charges, spoke of real engineering work to be done.

The Officers of the Company at this time were as follows:—Major
R. J. Donaldson was in command, but for a few days more
(until March 31st) was acting C.R.E. vice
Lieut.
-Col. T. R.
Williams, D.S.O., on leave.
Capt.
O. B. Williams was second
in command.
Capt.
G. L. A. Thirkell had charge of
No.
1 section,
Lt. S. W. Matters
No.
2, Lt. W. H. Thomas, M.C.,
No.
3, while
Lt. R. W. Lahey was painfully hurrying from leave in the South
of France to resume command of
No.
4. Lt. R. G. Rutledge
was in charge of the transport. The company was at full strength
and still had nearly one half of its original members. G. Brodie
was C.S.M., H. G. Whitrow (who held the position throughout
the whole history of the unit) C.Q.M.S. (somewhat irreverently
known as the Quarter-Bloke); and W. Russel, mounted Sergeant.

2.
Between the Somme and Ancre.

On its arrival in front of Amiens, on the 27th March, 1918,
the
3rd
Australian Division was ordered to hold a line running
from Sailly-le-Sec on the Somme to Mericourt lâAbbÃ© on the
Ancre, to prevent the enemy advancing along the high ridge
which lies between the two rivers and runs down to the town of
Corbie at their confluence. This ridge commands a wide view
to the westward, the cathedral at Amiens being clearly visible.
The situation was obscure, but the proximity of the enemy was
indicated by his intermittent shelling of the road from Franvillers
to Heilly with high velocity guns. Straight from their fatiguing
journey the troops took up their positions, the 11th A.I. Brigade
on the right of the main Bray road; and early in the evening
working parties of the 11th Field Company moved out from Heilly
and commenced trench digging.

The task ahead was enormous. A new defensive system had
to be established, and there were no R.E. dumps of tools and
material, very few maps available, very little information of any
kind. Reconnaissance for tools and material, of bridges and
streams and water supply, was thus of the highest importance,
and was put in hand early. Other work, more important than
trench digging, soon developed for the sappers. The map will
show how important in this sector were the river-crossings, and
accommodation for various commands was urgently required.

The bridges in Corbie, La Neuville, and Bonnay had been
roughly prepared for demolition, chiefly by the
173rd
Tunnelling

Pg 24

Coy.
, R.E., and the 1st Field Squadron, R.E., but a great deal
of work was called for, both to ensure certainty and completion
of destruction in case of necessity, and reasonable safety under
normal conditions. This work was put in hand,
No.
2 section
first moving to Bonnay and starting it, the remainder of the
company also proceeding there for convenience of control on the
evening of the 29th. On the 30th,
No.
3 section moved to Corbie
and took over the Corbie, La Neuville group of bridges. It was
on this day that the enemy attacked our line from the direction
of Sailly Laurette, but was beaten off with heavy loss. While
the attack was on
Capt.
O. B. Williams with a small party was
engaged in an examination of the steel bridge over the Somme at
Bouzencourt, near Sailly-le-Sec. The vicinity of the bridge came
under heavy shell fire, and as the party approached it one shell
hit and detonated a demolition charge which was on the bridge,
blowing down the towers of the lifting span, but not destroying
the bridge. For his work in connection with this reconnaissance
Corpl. Johns received the Military Medal.

Under the conditions of modern warfare, reasonably secure
accommodation for the Headquarters of Brigades and Battalions
is of great importance, and in particular these centres required
to be able to maintain their signal connections and carry on their
work at night without exposed lights to attract enemy aircraft.
In the chalk country deep dugouts provide the best accommodation,
and the company was soon busy on a number of these, in
âShrapnel Gully,â in the banks south of Marrett Wood, at 11th
Brigade Headquarters, in the wood near the gravel pits north of
Corbie, and in a number of other spots. At first the lack of
suitable material, and to some extent the inexperience of the men
at this work, were handicaps, but they were neutralised by sheer
hard work.

Before the programme could be more than started, another
aspect of the bridge question demanded attention. The available
crossings over the Ancre were few and well known, and would
certainly be heavily shelled in the event of a Boche attack. To
ensure the supply of ammunition to the guns east of the river,
emergency crossings were obviously needed, and were reconnoitred
and put in hand. A crossing north of Bonnay, with two
trestle bridges over the main streams of the Ancre, a number of
culverts, and a long length of rough corduroy, was started by the
11th Field Company on April
3rd
and finished on the 5th.

On the evening of the 5th a sudden demand was made for
a crossing south of Bonnay. All ordinary working parties were
already employed, but a hasty gathering up was made of all batmen,
cooks, a few spare drivers, the O.C.âs groom, and so on, and
with this party, Lt. Matters threw a three-bay pontoon bridge and
a two-bay Weldon trestle bridge across the two main streams, in
pitch darkness. The bridges were in use by midnight, and the

Pg 25

men concerned were more than a little proud to be the first to put
the companyâs bridging gear to real use.

Meanwhile the enemy had pressed forward on the south side
of the Somme, and was reported to be very close to the steel
bridge at Bouzencourt already mentioned. It was decided that
the bridge should be destroyed and this was done early in the
morning of the 6th by a party from
No.
1 section, under
Capt.

Thirkell and Sergt. Oliver, assisted by C.S.M. Brodie. The main
span of the bridge was cut and dropped into the canal. Sergt.
Oliver received the Military Medal.

Sketches of this bridge and of the bridges over the Ancre,
of panoramas from O.P.âs, and other features of interest, were
made by
Spr.
Vasco, of the unit, well known as a caricaturist,
and were used to illustrate the war diary. Unfortunately,
Spr.

Vasco died of disease in England before the end of the summer.

The war at this stage was not without its compensations.
After the plains of Flanders the broad views from the downs were
refreshing, and it was interesting to be able so frequently to see
your enemy in the open. Billeting in the deserted villages was
good, and the abandoned live stock of the country-side added
variety to the menu.
No.
3 section kept a poultry farm at their
billet in Corbie and paid tribute to Company Headquarters in
the produce thereof. They were also in the possession of a cow
tended by âBlueyâ Graham, the section Q.M. More than one
revolution occurred in
No.
3 after that time, and several Q.M.âs
were deposed, but Graham can still claim to be the only section
Q.M. who ever kept a vache. Unfortunately, while leading it
along the road by a string one day he met a member of the French
Missionâ¦.

On the 8th April
No.
1 section moved into a rough bivouac
in a chalk quarry overlooking the Somme, in order to be nearer
their work. The 2nd Australian Tunnelling
Coy.
took charge of
the various bridges on the 18th, thus releasing
Nos.
2 and 3
sections, and next day
No.
2 joined
No.
1 in their riverside quarry.
With more men available, the dugout industry increased apace.

Meanwhile the difficulty of supplying the industry with
timber had become acute. Salvage operations in Corbie and
neighbouring villages had yielded small supplies, and corps
managed to send a little from time to time, but the demand
increased much faster than the supply. Two or three Queensland
bushmen from
No.
4 section were early set to work with pitsaws
in one of the woods, and helped appreciably, but the problem was
not solved until a steam saw milling plant was âsouveniredâ
from Corbie, repaired, and erected on the banks of the Ancre near
Bonnay.

This developed into quite a prosperous, if entirely unofficial
concern, and large quantities of sawn timber were produced from
the plantations along the river.

Pg 26

On the 24th the enemy delivered his attack on Villers-Brettoneux,
and the
3rd
Divisional sector was heavily shelled. Company
Headquarters and 3 and 4 sections were shelled out of
Bonnay, losing several horses, but otherwise escaping without
serious loss, but 1 and 2 sections in their quarry position were
less fortunate, both
Lieut.
Matters and
Lieut.
Melbourne (who
had just taken over
No.
1 section) being wounded rather badly,
and several men gassed. Driver J. H. Cannell subsequently
received the Military Medal for rescuing a badly wounded man
in Bonnay under very trying circumstances.

After this experience an open-air life seemed preferable to
the somewhat damaged billets in Bonnay, so a camp was established
in an open valley just west of Heilly. The first site chosen
was rather unfortunate, as within a day or two a battery of 8in.
hows. planted themselves alongside, and a move of three or four
hundred yards along the valley had to be made to avoid these
noisy neighbours.

A new Brigade Headquarters being called for in Heilly, it
was decided to burrow into a huge old retaining wall which ran
round part of the Chateau grounds. The sappers were not without
hope of finding buried treasure—preferably in the shape of a
well-stocked and forgotten wine cellar—behind this mysterious
old wall, but all they found was loose and treacherous filling,
making the work slow and arduous.

The work of the section cooks deserves to be mentioned,
particularly under the conditions which prevailed on this sector,
when each section was split into parties working various shifts
on dugouts and other work, coming and going and expecting
meals at all hours of the day and night.
No.
2 section will always
remember the hot roast meal prepared for them in the quarry on
the 24th April by Sapper Castle, literally cooked between bursts
of shelling and the cook most of the time in a gas mask.

The unit was issued with its first Lewis gun on this sector,
for defence against low-flying aircraft, and shortly afterwards
had an object lesson in the efficacy of the weapon when the
famous German airman Von Richtofen was shot down by a Lewis
gun belonging to an Australian Field Artillery Battery. His
bright red triplane crashed quite close to a party of sappers of
the company.

On the 1st of May the 9th Field Company, coincident with
the relief of the 11th Brigade by the 9th Brigade, took over the
work in forward areas; the plans prepared by the company surveyors
of the old French trenches partly occupied by our troops,
and of the extensive new works dug by them, were handed over.
Work was continued at the saw mill, at the âHole in the wallâ
above-mentioned, and a good deal of work was done in various
Headquartersâ dugouts in the extraordinary series of trenches
which had been dug under corps supervision between the Ancre

Pg 27

and the Hallue. A good deal of the novelty of the situation had
now worn off, the supply of adventitious aids to the rationing
had failed, and a regular trench warfare routine had been established
when the
3rd
Division was relieved by the 2nd and the
11th Field
Coy.
by the 7th, on May the 10th. The
3rd
Division
passed into close reserve, and the 11th Field Company moved to
Pont Noyelles on the Hallue, and took over various Corps jobs
from the 6th Field Company.

3.
Pont Noyelles.

The few days rest in the valley of the Hallue will be memorable
to members of the company chiefly by reason of the glorious
weather and the beauty of the country-side in its garb of late
spring. Even thus early in what was destined to be a hot and dry
summer, the sun shone warm enough to make the deep lagoons
along the river attractive to bathers. The quarters taken over were
all crowded practically under one roof right on the main cross roads
in Pont Noyelles, and as the Boche bombing planes were rather
active, the greater part of the company was shifted out of the
village into two tented camps by the riverside. Work was not
very exacting, and consisted of improvements to the bridge crossings
over the Hallue and the development of the trench system
designed as a bridge head defence in front of Pont Noyelles and
Querrieu. The 86th Labour Company, R.E., supplied parties
for these works, supervised by the 11th Field Company.

It has frequently been remarked, throughout the history of
the unit, that release from strenuous line work was generally
followed by an increase of sickness. No doubt the rest following
heavy and absorbing work brought about re-action, physical as
well as mental.

This occasion was no exception to the rule, as an outbreak
of influenza, or some such disease, led to the evacuation to
hospital of a considerable number of men, a total of 34 being
lost to the unit in this way in five days ending May 15th.
No.
1
section suffered particularly severely, and a number of original
members of the unit, men rather advanced in years, after surviving
two winters, were invalided out of the service as the result
of this outbreak.

While the Division was out of the line it was inspected by
the Commander-in-Chief, F.-M. Sir Douglas Haig, a Brigade
group at the time, and the dismounted portion of the 11th Field
Company took part in the 11th Brigade parade. Very short
notice was received, and right up to the morning of the inspection
there had been no opportunity for even a proper section parade,
since leaving the rest area in March. Nevertheless, the Company,
rising to the situation, carried out the necessary movements,
including a march past, with precision and success. The
transport were not on this parade, but were carefully inspected

Pg 28

about the same time by the A.A. and Q.M.G.,
3rd
Division, and
the C.R.E.

Pont Noyelles was left on May 21st, when the
3rd
Division
relieved the 4th Australian Division in the Villers Brettoneux
sector. The 4th Field Company A.E. took over the Corps works
in the Hallue valley, and the 13th Field Company A.E. was
relieved in the line. Company Headquarters was established
in a railway cutting just north of the Bois lâAbbÃ©, near Villers
Brettoneux, together with 2, 3, and 4 sections. The remainder
of
No.
1 section went to Blangy-Tronville, together with some of
the surveyors, for whom there was no accommodation suitable
for map work in the cutting, while the horse lines were established
at Lamotte, a little further along the river.

4.
Summer at Villers Brettoneux.

The line held by the
3rd
Division at Villers Brettoneux,
which junctioned with the French on the right opposite Monument
Wood, was so close to the town that the support line actually
ran through one corner near the railway station. The possession
of the town with its command of the Somme valley was of great
importance; the enemy had captured it once, only to be turned
out again; and signs were not wanting that he intended to attack
again, and soon. These considerations enjoined a more than
ordinary alertness on the defence, and a vigorous artillery
programme of counter preparation.

The 11th Field Company had a direct interest in the artillery
programme, because a fine pair of 8in. âhows.â lived just outside
their railway cutting, and were very active. Such neighbours
naturally âdrew crabsâ (as the saying was, i.e., attracted enemy
fire), but fortunately no great harm was done during the companyâs
tenancy.

The camp in the railway cutting was, as a matter of fact,
soon made reasonably safe against shell fire by burrowing into
the solid chalk. Gas was a more insidious danger; gas shelling
was frequent, and sometimes extraordinarily heavy, as on the
night of the 25-26th, when Villers Brettoneux, the Bois lâAbbÃ©,
and the valley between were literally drenched with mustard gas
from many thousands of shells. Fortunately the immediate
vicinity of the camp escaped the worst of it, and the vigilance of
doubled gas guards prevented casualties in the camp itself.

Although a number of shells, both high explosive and gas,
fell at different times right in the cutting, the most serious
damage resulted from a mysterious something which screamed
into the camp one night, broke all the crockery in the officersâ
mess kitchen, and set the shelter on fire. The gas sentry standing
near by was seriously perturbed by this new engine of war,
but it turned out to be merely a mis-directed message rocket.

Pg 29

The chief work of the sappers on this sector was again
accommodation in the form of deep dugouts in the chalk, but
general trench improvements, the new support line through the
town, tank blocks, tunnels under the main roads to Warfusee,
and the inner defences of âVillers Brett,â all made demands on
sapper labour. The 11th Field Company throughout worked in
the right brigade area, astride the main road, where the line was
held first by the 11th Brigade, and afterwards by the 10th, then
by the 11th once more. The weather throughout was âfine and
warm,â so warm as to make shirt sleeves quite sufficient, and
tin hats almost intolerable.

Arrangements for the regular supply of materials by Corps
had now allowed of standardisation of dugout design, and a great
number of roomy shelters were rapidly excavated. Before the
division moved out there were over 120 deep dugouts in its sector,
many of them large enough to accommodate two or more platoons.
The inclines or stairway entrances, at least two to each dugout,
were timbered with standard timber slabs; the chambers were
supported by 9ft. standard 5in. by 3in. rolled steel joists, about
18in. apart, held up by pit props. Bunks were fitted throughout,
and elaborate gas-proof doorways. In addition to the Field Companies,
portions of the Pioneers, and two English and one (the
2nd) Australian Tunnelling Coys. were at different times employed
on the works. As regards the 11th Field Company, sappers
worked three shifts of seven hours at the face, and were generally
assisted by infantry parties in getting rid of the spoil.

The pit props required for the chambers mostly came from
the Bois lâAbbÃ©, and in the same wood a small party of sappers
from the company, with a few infantry, ran a very useful industry,
manufacturing large numbers of hurdles and brush wood mats,
the latter being chiefly used for hiding the chalk spoil heaps from
aerial observation.

The support line through Villers Brettoneux was a difficult
job and
No.
3 section expended a considerable amount of labour
pushing down walls with Wallaby jacks, in order to clear a field
of fire. The same section also constructed a novel tank block
on the railway near the station, as the enemy had already used
tanks in this area, and it was feared he might send one down
the big railway cutting.

The inner defences of the town itself consisted of a series
of so-called âkeeps,â or defended posts, among the buildings,
wired round, loop-holed, and with strengthened cellars in which
the garrisons lived. Part of the time the garrisons consisted of
detachments of Pioneers, who carried out their own works, but
when infantry was in occupation, sappers from the company
shored up cellars, loop-holed walls, fitted gas-proof doorways, and
strung barbed wire among the shattered buildings of the ruined
town.

Pg 30

While on this sector the company had an officer (
Lieut.

Raynsford) and four sergeants of the 6th U.S. Engineers attached
for instruction.

Noteworthy dugout jobs of the company were the double
Battalion Headquarters at the Monastery, in the Bois lâAbbÃ©;
extensions to the headquarters in the quarry on the western outskirts
of Villers Bretonneux; a Company Headquarters near the
gas works, and extension to Brigade Headquarters on the railway
line. Two very large dugouts, begun by the 4th Division, were
completed in the notorious Gas valley, between the Bois lâAbbÃ©
and the town; a dugout was completed near the main road in
the wood for a Trench Mortar Battery, and a couple of jobs were
started east of the town.

Tunnels under the main highway which runs from Villers
Brettoneux to Warfusee Abancourt, where the various trench
lines intersected it, were commenced with some interest, as the
road was said to be of Roman origin, and it was thought that
remains might perhaps be disclosed illustrative of the methods
of the great road builders. Nothing of interest was discovered,
the road consisting of quite a thin shell of ordinary macadam
resting on loam.

This was the only period when the
3rd
Division held the line
alongside the French. The relations between the two were at
all times very cordial. The Australian exchanged cigarettes for
a share of the Frenchmanâs âpinardâ (issue wine), while the
poilu was not slow to appreciate the âbucksheeâ (free) cocoa of
the Y.M.C.A., or âimkaâ as he pronounced it. The railway
cutting inhabited by the 11th Field Company was an international
post in itself, as in addition to the company it was used by the
headquarters of a French battery, and the cookhouse of the British
8in. hows. detachment already mentioned. What helped to
endear the French soldier to the Australian was a fellow feeling
arising from his noticeable readiness to appropriate to his own
uses, in cheerful contravention of rules and regulations, such
trifles as railway sleepers and rails, also anything which he could
find to his liking in Villers Brettoneux. International posts in
the line were a favourite subject for official photographers; international
foraging parties in the ruined town might have provided
much more interesting unofficial pictures, if only private cameras
had been allowed.

The Company Transport, working from Lamotte, had a busy
time on this sector. All supplies, including water, had, of course,
to be taken to the railway cutting, but in addition, the transport
of engineer material from the motor lorry dump to the various
dugouts kept teams going constantly in the pontoon and G.S.
wagons.

Although the Corps supply of timber was good, it was never
sufficient for requirements, and three or four sappers were kept

Pg 31

working pit saws on a big pile of logs on the canal bank near the
horse lines.

The Villers Brettoneux sector was taken over by the 2nd
Australian Division on June 27th and the 11th Field Company
handed over to the 7th Field Company and marched back to
Rivery, a suburb of Amiens.

5.
Rivery.

The town of Amiens, an important railway junction, the possession
of which was accepted as a token of our successful resistance
to the enemy attempts to separate the British and French Armies,
was in June, 1918, almost completely deserted by its civilian
population. An almost nightly target for heavy bombing, it was
also consistently shelled with long range guns, the huge shells
from which rushed down the river valley making noises
even more menacing than those of ordinary shells, and
crashed into the unfortunate city. The neighbourhood of Rivery,
where the 11th Field Company took over billets and works from
the 5th Field Company, was entirely deserted. The billets were
quite good, and lay alongside one of the lagoons or âbillabongs,â
which are such a feature of the Somme in this region.

The weather was glorious, and opportunities for river bathing
much appreciated. All through June the Somme canal had
been bathed in by swarms of Australians enjoying short periods
of rest from the line, but the 11th Field Company had lived continuously
in the railway cutting far from the river, and had been
forced to postpone such pleasure until the divisional relief.

As usual, the sappers passed directly from line work to Corps
or back area work, but this time it was chiefly guarding bridges
and road mines around Camon, Longueau, and Cagny, and improvements
to the demolition charges. Many of the bridge guards
had excellent quarters among pleasant riverside gardens, where
a little fruit was still to be gathered from the bushes, to the
improvement of the ration scale.

All through the 1918 campaign of the
3rd
Division on the
Somme, the soldier was much more isolated from the amenities
of civil life than had been his lot, except for comparatively short
and violent periods of battle, in Flanders. There numerous
estaminets close enough behind the line to be within easy reach
of reserve troops supplied, as welcome addition and variety to
the Army ration, eggs, chipped potatoes, even fresh meat; as
witness the well-known sign in old Bailleul, Steak and Shipseggs.
Such opportunities were almost entirely wanting in the Somme
area, and as will appear it was not until very near the end of
hostilities that the men of the
3rd
Division had a chance to experience
the civilising influence of even a glass of thin French beer
in a cafÃ©, with a joke or two exchanged with Madame, and,
perhaps, a little love-making with Madamoiselle.

Pg 32

Under these circumstances members of the 11th Field Company
will always have a kindly feeling for the efforts of Sapper
Monk, the canteen steward, in foraging on their behalf. In his
dusty mess cart, drawn by that incorrigible wind sucker,
âJews Harp,â he penetrated (it can be safely admitted now) into
many towns and villages where his presence was entirely contrary
to various routine orders; but he brought back the beer to the
thirsty troops.

If the gardens of Rivery provided but small supplies of fruit
and vegetables, they were very rich in bright flowers, and most
of the menâs billets were gay with them. The âdiggersâ tastes
are not confined, as some would say, to leave and beer, and
souvenirs.

The capture of Hamel took place while the company was at
Rivery. This brilliant little operation was carried out by the
4th Australian Division, assisted by a brigade of the 2nd Division
and the 11th Brigade of the
3rd
Division. Some American
troops also took part, and also tanks. A party from the 11th
Field Company, under
Lieut.
E. H. Rhodes, laid out the jumping-off
tapes for the 11th Brigade in âNo Manâs Land,â and
another party carried out various small dugout jobs in connection
with the operations. The necessary âprevious reconnaissanceâ
was rather arduous, carried out from such a distant base as
Rivery, and in a spell of exceptionally hot weather, but âthe
lineâ was not without interest. A roadside quarry in the front
trench gave a splendid view of the sector over which the 11th
Brigade had to attack, and of the âNo Manâs Landâ in which
the tapes had to be laid the night before the battle.

Gently undulating cornfields were clothed thick with wheat,
in heavy ear, but still green and interspersed with the scarlet
poppies and blue cornflowers, which made a brave show in all this
country throughout the summer. Beyond lay the Somme,
marked by a dense band of trees, and beyond again the chalk hills
first held by the
3rd
Division in March. For a while before the
battle, artillery activity on both sides was small, and the country-side
seemed to brood under a blazing sun in mysterious unnatural
lifelessness. The opposing forces were indicated only by the
straggling lines of red earth which marked the trenches through
the crops; barbed wire and shell holes were alike hidden by the
thick growth. That all was not well with the world was hinted
by the holes clearly visible in the roof of Corbieâs fine church,
and by the scarred and battered and entirely sinister ruins of
Hamel appearing through equally scarred and battered trees.
Beyond Hamel lay the ridge which dominated much of our
position, and which our infantry and tanks seized on the 4th of
July.

While this battle was pending, the company was called on to
supply various parties for odd jobs, involving the distribution of

Pg 33

the unit into a multitude of details in the manner characteristic
of Field Companies. One party built a small motor-transport
bridge in Corbie, another erected some experimental camouflage
over a bridge over the canal near Lamotte, while improvements
to the hutments at Corps Headquarters at Bertangles, gave
employment to a number of carpenters.

In accordance with the usual cycle of reliefs, the
3rd
Division
relieved the 4th in the line astride the Somme (including
the newly-captured Hamel). On July 11th and 12th, the 11th
Field Company on this occasion relieved the 12th, and became
reserve company, with headquarters in shelters along the railway
embankment near La Neuville, and horse lines at Bussy. The
12th Field Company took over the Rivery billets and works.

6.
Corbie.

The work of the reserve Field Company of the Division holding
the line where it crossed the Somme valley, between Sailly
Le Sec and Sailly Laurette, was spread up and down the Somme,
from Bouzencourt to below Daours; and from just below Bonnay
on the river Ancre to its confluence with the Somme at La
Neuville. On first undertaking it, the 11th Field Company had
its headquarters in a camp alongside the railway embankment
near La Neuville, a position which it shared with the headquarters
of the 10th Field Company, then in line on the right of
the divisional front.
No.
1 section was up the river at Vaire,

No.
2, with section headquarters in the familiar gas works, was
in Corbie,
No.
3 at La Neuville itself, and
No.
4 at Daours. All
were employed on various tasks in connection with bridges, but
as some of the work was merely guarding, and as sappers were
urgently required for other work, a party of some 50 odd infantry
were attached to the company from the 11th Brigade.
No.
2
section, reinforced with infantry, with section headquarters
remaining in the gas works, took over from
No.
1, and
No.
4
similarly added
No.
3âs tasks to its own.

Most of the original bridges in the care of the two sections,
as well as the temporary steel or wooden structures erected by
the Army to provide alternative crossings, had been fitted with
an excellent system of demolition charges in sealed tins by the
12th Field Company A.E., but further work of the kind remained
to be done, and there were electric circuits to test, leads to bury,
and numerous improvements to be carried out. Altogether there
were about eight bridges prepared for demolition near Daours,
the same number near La Neuville, and ten at Corbie. In
addition there was a number of barrel pier foot bridges across the
Somme, chiefly between Bouzencourt and Corbie, calling for a
good deal of maintenance, some dummy bridges, a couple of
stand-by pontoon bridges, and the night bridge at âCircular
Quay,â near Vaire. This was a pontoon bridge to take field

Pg 34

artillery, put in position every night at dark, and dismantled and
hidden at dawn. A detachment of sappers lived in the cellars
of Vaire to do this, and generally had the assistance of a party
from a regiment of U.S. Engineers, who for the sake of the experience,
marched every night from some place in the rear, helped
build the bridge, departed in the morning, after persuading the
11th Corporal in charge to teach them a few knots and splices,
and were replaced by a new party next night. The bridge was
very largely used each night by both infantry transport and gun
limbers.

Shortly after the company took over, one of the bridges at
Daours was hit by a shell which blew out the abutment from
under one girder. The girder was jacked up and the abutment
repaired in brick.

The living conditions on these bridge jobs were quite good.
The Corbie billets had a good billiard table, La Neuville possessed
an excellent piano, and there were plenty of opportunities for
swimming. Had the Boche attacked on this front, the position
of the bridge guards would have been very unenviable, but
fortunately he did not do so, and the company sustained no
serious casualties on this work.

The sappers relieved off bridges by the employment of
attached infantry were immediately occupied with other tasks.

No.
3 section worked at a water point—engine and pump and
tanks and standpipes—at a spring on the road from La Neuville
to Daours; helped the 11th Brigade to improve the dugouts in
their reserve positions, and made some experiments in the art
of building shelters in chalk banks, with the idea of developing
the best method of housing the corps for the winter.
No.
1
provided a party, under
Lieut.
Valentine, which was attached
to Artillery Group Headquarters to supervise work on gun
positions, chiefly more dugouts; the remainder of the section
extracted the charges from a number of road mines near Fouilloy,
and on July 18th started preliminary work for a proposed pile
bridge across the Somme canal, west of Vaire. This last was
quite an ambitious project. Piles were cut and shod, a long
stretch of corduroy road laid down, and a monkey was improvised
by âborrowingâ a 9.2 shell from a battery, extracting, not
without difficulty, the solid T.N.T. bursting charge, and filling
the cavity with lead. All was in readiness for driving the first
pile when orders came to suspend operations.

These orders were the first hint of the approaching offensive,
and were followed by instructions received on August 2nd to
send the attached infantry home, after partly dismantling the
demolition arrangements, and to concentrate most of the sappers,
leaving a few men to patrol the groups of bridges. Detonators
and primers were removed from the circuits and stored separately;
the leads and fuzes of fixed charges were concealed.

Pg 35

It is quite possible that a proposal for an attack with limited
objectives, and on a small scale, would not have been very
popular with the troops, tired as they undoubtedly were after
nearly five monthsâ strenuous warfare; but the plans for the
proposed battle, as outlined in the first days of August, fired the
imagination. This was to be a âstuntâ worth doing. To follow
the first attack at once with a second, and so to penetrate some
five or six miles within the enemy lines; thus to capture most
of his guns; and to play around in his back areas with light
tanks and armoured cars and cavalry; such schemes as these must
help to win the war.

The first definite battle instructions marked the end of the
great programme of works carried out to stem the German
advance; thenceforward our labours were to fulfil the requirements
of our counter-stroke; and the preparations for the first
blow may best be included in the tale of the attack itself. The
last bridge had been mined, the last deep dugout dug.

CHAPTER
IV.

THE GREAT OFFENSIVE.

1.
The 8th of August, 1918.

A narrative of the experiences of a small unit in the Great
War most properly should include only those facts and aspects of
the struggle, which the unit learnt in the field from its own
observation and adventures. A keen student of the newspapers
in London, or even in Melbourne, will have a more complete knowledge
of the progress of events, and a more comprehensive view
of the general situation than the soldier in the field, whose view is
curtailed by the âFog of War,â and who, besides, is too absorbed
in the problems of his own immediate sector to have the leisure of
the arm-chair strategist.

For the members of the formation to be engaged, the eve of
the battle of Amiens was, however, one of the exceptional cases
where even a hint of coming events illuminates the whole military
position.

It was obvious that the enemy had lost the initiative in the
failure of his attempt to force the Marne, and that the violent
battles on the French and American sectors in July marked its
definite passage to the Allies.

August the 8th was to be the first real occasion of its use by
us and the first ambitious attack by the British Army for 1918.
There were few in the
3rd
Division who did not realise this, scanty
as was the information possessed by any but very senior officers
as to the concentration of troops, tanks, and guns, and more particularly
as to the elaborate precautions taken to disguise such
preparations as the move of the Canadian troops to the Somme
area.

The task of the
3rd
Division was to initiate the attack on a
front of some two miles immediately South of the Somme, and to
penetrate about 2Â½ miles. Through it would then pass the 4th
Australian Division covered by mobile artillery. A similar programme
was to be carried out by the 2nd and 5th Australian Divisions
on the Villers-Brettonneux sector to the South; south of
them were the Canadians, and then the French. The 1st Australian
Division arrived from the north on the eve of the battle, and
was Corps Reserve in the early stages. The British Division holding

Pg 37

the line north of the Somme was to swing forward its flank
along the river. No preliminary bombardment of the enemy
positions was to take place, and the commencement of operations
was to be in effect a surprise attack delivered under a heavy barrage.

This was the first occasion in which the five Australian Divisions
were engaged together in an offensive action.

The preparations as far as Engineers were concerned were not
elaborate. Various dugouts required for headquarters and medical
posts had to be hurried to completion, but no trench work was
required, as the approach routes to the assembly position for the
attacking troops were overland. Four tracks were cleared and
carefully marked by the 11th Field Company, two starting near
Fouilloy, and two near Hamelet, and, as already mentioned, the
bridge demolition arrangements were partly dismantled. Owing
to the depth of the proposed attack it was not considered advisable
to form Engineer dumps in the existing trench system; instead,
a system of dumps on wheels was devised. The Pontoon wagons
of the three Field Companies were collected and loaded with a
variety of stores, including a number of simple shelters for erection
under suitable chalk banks, and delivery points were selected in
the territory to be captured. The 11th Field
Coy.
made 50 bank
shelters and 500 signboards.

Much depended on the early repair of all roads leading forward
into the enemy territory. This work was undertaken by
Corps, who withdrew two Field Companies and the Pioneer Battalion
from the
3rd
Division for this purpose, leaving the 11th the
only Company under Divisional command. Two companies of the
2nd Australian Pioneers were lent to the Division for the operation,
and under these circumstances the Field Company was necessarily
widely distributed.
No.
1 section was allotted to the 9th Brigade,
which was to attack on the right, and
No.
2 to the 11th Brigade
on the left;
No.
3 was in reserve (as was the 10th Brigade, which
held the whole divisional front before the battle), and
No.
4 had
the special task of looking for sources of water supply.

Very heavy rain fell two or three days before the attack, and
threatened to interfere with the work of the tanks, but the 7th
was fine and warm, and the chalky soil dried very quickly. The
rain was really very helpful, as it served to hide the gathering
forces from enemy aviators. By the 7th all was ready; long rows
of tanks sheltered under hedges, guns of all calibres lurked in
every suitable position, and men and horses rested quietly within
the shade of groves of trees.

The evening before Z day saw Company Headquarters and
1, 2, and 4 sections established at a dugout and bivouac near
Hamelet, but during the night the various parties moved forward
to a trench near Hamel. Just at âZero hourâ (4.20 a.m.) a thick
mist arose, and it was through this natural screen that the attack

Pg 38

pushed forward, and that the various parties of Sappers groped
their way to their various tasks soon after.

The results of the dayâs fighting are too well known to need
mention, but the cheapness of the victory may be gauged by the
losses of the Company—which were—none at all. The dumps on
wheels moved forward under
Lieut.
Matters to their appointed
destinations early in the morning;
Nos.
1 and 2 sections built
shelters for various headquarters in the new captured divisional
area, and
No.
4 located several old wells and started putting them
in order, and also constructed, out of salvaged materials, a most
useful horse-watering point at Gailly Lock on the Somme. A
number of Germans surrendered to the sappers, but as they were
considered to be âsecond hand,â they were carefully searched for
pistols and such-like souvenirs and turned adrift to find their own
way to the rear. One subaltern of the Company was approached in
mist by a Boche who was tugging violently at something in
his pocket. Thinking it was a pistol, the officer drew his revolver,
but the Germanâs hand came forth with nothing more menacing
than a tin of bully beef, which he handed out as a peace offering.
It was a great day for souvenirs, and the sappers collected quite
an arsenal of German automatic pistols, daggers, and such-like
coveted articles.

2.
Up the Valley of the Somme.

The breaking of the German line on the 8th August
marked the end of the old âsit downâ trench warfare, and to no one
did this represent a bigger change than to the sappers. Instead
of settling down for a month or more at a time in a camp
or bivouac, with a regular programme of work, a system for the
supply of engineer stores, and no sign or hope of an end to the
proceedings, the Company now commenced to experience conditions
approximating to those of open warfare, with troubles and
discomforts all compensated for by victory, and at least a hope of
peace to come. That Company Headquarters was established in
twenty different places in the ensuing two months gives only a
partial indication of the migrations of the sappers, as sections
developed a habit of moving independently, each complete with its
own transport, and the Company was rarely united.

Work naturally changed; bridges, water supply, roads and
signboards became most important; trenches and wire were rarely
thought of; dugouts were searched for booby traps, cleaned and
repaired, instead of new ones being started. During the period of
most rapid advance the Division gained little advantage from some
of the Sappersâ labour, but such people as the heavy artillery and
transport units following behind were not inappreciative, particularly
of signboards and water supply arrangements. On the 9th
of August Company Headquarters and 3 and 4 Sections moved to
a bivouac near Bois de Hamel, and on the 10th to a large dug-out

Pg 39

and bivouac near Bouzencourt—a camp generally known as
âPip 4 Ackâ from its map location, where the horse lines were
also established. In the meanwhile
Nos.
1 and 2 sections had
been living and working in the newly captured area, complete with
section transport, and late in the evening of the 10th they were
ordered to accompany the 10th Brigade in a night operation along
the main road which runs east through Lamotte-en-Santerre. The
operation did not develop, and the sappers were not required, so
the two sections went into bivouac in a deep valley just south of
the main road and north of Harbonnieres. They suffered no
casualties at this stage, but are not likely to forget the bombing
along the road on the night of the 10th/11th.

On the 11th the remainder of the Company moved to a valley
South of Morcourt on the Somme and relieved the 12th Field
Coy.
,
but were in turn relieved by the
93rd
Company, R.E. the following
night, and returned to P.4.a. Short as the time was in this
area
No.
3 section built a new
Battn.
Headquarters and an R.A.P.;

No.
4 section investigated and improved a considerable number of
wells.

Both the vicinity of the
Coy.
camp near Morcourt, and the
valley near Harbonnieres occupied by 1 and 2 sections, had been
largely used by the Germans for battery positions and living
accommodation, and it was very interesting to study their
methods so soon after their very hurried departure. They had
done very little work near their front line, but the numerous dugouts
started in their gun zone, and excavated stables in course of
construction, seemed to indicate an intention to organise an
elaborate system of defences. The impression thus formed was
confirmed afterwards by the enormous amounts of engineer materials
in their main dumps.

Sappers were pleased to find that the German dugouts, and
much of his other work, were inferior to our own, both in design
and execution. All sorts of interesting souvenirs were discovered
while exploring the dugouts and camps, a number being dispatched
to the Australian War Museum. Similarly, a large number of
maps were collected and forwarded to the General Staff. Horses
enjoyed extra rations of Boche fodder, and some of the men drew
clean underclothing and new boots from a Boche Quartermasterâs
store—in the absence of the Quartermaster. A number of wagons
were collected and loaded with Engineer materials, thus forming a
âDump on German wheels,â in readiness for another advance,
but were handed over to the
93rd
Field Company.

On the night of the 12th/13th, some wandering tanks took
shelter in the gully occupied by 1 and 2 sections, and were apparently
marked down by a Boche plane, which showered bombs
on the camp. Driver W. Thomas, who was noted for his pride in
his two horses, and who used to remark frequently that wherever
his team went, he went also, was saying good-night to his charges

Pg 40

when a bomb fell alongside and killed the man and both his
horses.

The whole Company concentrated at P.4.a on the 13th, and
refitted, bathed, and dug bomb pits for the horses until the 19th,
when work was started fixng up accommodation for Divisional
Headquarters in the well-remembered Shrapnel Gully near Sailly-le-Sec.
On the 20th the Division went into the line North of the
Somme, and
Coy.
Headquarters and
Nos.
2 and 3 sections moved
to Mallard Wood,
N.W.
of Chipilly. The Division attacked at
dawn on the 22nd, forming a flank for operations to the North; on
the
23rd
it captured La Neuville near Bray, and on the 24th Bray
itself fell to the 10th Brigade.

On the 25th the 9th and 11th Brigades captured the high
ridge of Ceylon Wood east of Bray, and thenceforward the advance
progressed so rapidly, in spite of enemy resistance, that by the end
of the month the Division had captured Suzanne, Curlu, and
ClÃ©ry, and had reached the Bouchavesnes—Mt. St. Quentin road,
some ten miles East of Bray, and 15 miles east of the line of
August 8th.

During the early stages of this advance the roads had sustained
a good deal of damage from shell fire, and a portion of the
Company was employed filling in shell holes and removing fallen
trees and dead horses. In order to relieve the main roads, cross-country
tracks were much used. They were in good condition,
thanks to the dryness of the summer, but required marking with
numerous signboards. Throughout the whole period water supply
was of the highest importance. Wells had to be located, tested,
often cleared of rubbish and fitted with new windlasses. Fortunately
the Boche had not troubled to destroy wells, but had
devoted all his energies to blowing up railway lines. As evidence
of his enthusiasm for this work it may be mentioned that the Company
removed misfired or unexploded charges to the number of
some hundred from a comparatively short length of line near Hem.
Horse watering was of course done from the Somme, but horse
troughing had to be erected, as a number of horses were drowned
while attempting to water from the treacherous swamps and
lagoons along the river. Dugouts, whether of German origin, as
those around Bray, or built originally by the French, as were a
number near Suzanne and Hem, had all to be carefully searched
for mines and booby traps before being used by various Headquarters,
and generally required repairs. An interesting task was
making an inventory of the various German dumps captured.
There were several very large ones round Bray, containing enormous
quantities of mining and other timber, steel girders, barbed
wire and pickets, corrugated iron and malthoid, and all sorts of
interesting odds and ends. One dump, for instance, in addition to
much timber, had hundreds of sets of door hinges and fastenings
and window fittings, which would seem to indicate that the

Pg 41

German contemplated a big hutting programme in this area.
There was a large dump near the railway at Hem Wood, and this
the Company was camped alongside at the end of the month.

Two dumps contained small workshops for the manufacture
of anti-tank mines, and a long train laden with timber, malthoid,
iron and paper sandbags lay in the Bray station yard—with every
axle-box destroyed with explosives.

Intermediate
Coy. Hdqrs.
camps since leaving Mallard Wood
had been along a bank near Bray; in some German huts in Ceylon
Wood; and along a bank facing the Somme at Hem.

At the Bray camp site, just before the unit moved in, the
C.S.M., G. Brodie (D.C.M.), was wounded by a shell and died
soon after.

In the advance the division crossed, between Suzanne and
Curlu, the original front line of 1916, and passed on to the area
devastated by the fighting of that year. The desolation of this
region of shell-holes, dead woods, and villages represented by a
few broken bricks has often been described; suffice it is to say that
all ranks were pleased that progress across it was rapid.

On Sept.
3rd
the Divisional front was cut out by the 2nd Australian
Division and the 74th Division joining across it, and the
Company started improving accommodation for the 11th Brigade
in the area around Curlu. As there seemed some possibility of a
short stay in this dismal locality, the 11th Brigade Concert Party—the
âBlue Gumsâ—was brought up, and the Company improvised
a concert hall, with stage and seats for 450, out of the ruins
of some huts at Curlu. Work was also continued on water supply
arrangements. The area had been too far behind the Boche line
for him to make much use of it during the summer, and he had
done nothing to improve and little to maintain the old wells sunk
in 1916, which proved scarcely able to cope with the demands of
the concentration of men and animals now living in the vicinity.
Fortunately the 74th Division, which here overlapped the
3rd
, had
only recently come from Palestine, and being thus familiar with
the problem, helped a great deal to improve the conditions.

But the Eastern sky indicated with increasing clearness that
the warlike stream would soon move forward. The strong position
about Peronne had been breached by the 2nd Australian
Divisionâs capture of Mt. St. Quentin, and the glow of many fires
by night, and huge columns of smoke by day, showed that the
enemy was burning everything possible in the country behind him,
preparatory to a retreat to the Hindenburg line. So no one was
very surprised when on Sept. 5th orders were received to move
once more.

3.
Up the Valley of the Cologne.

The Cologne is a small stream which, rising in the high ground
which separates the headwaters of the Escaut or Scheldt from the
Somme, runs in a westerly direction and joins the latter river at

Pg 42

Peronne. It flows through a broad open valley, and is quite a small
stream, but with a wide, marshy bed in many places. In the
summer of 1918 it had no surface water above Tincourt.

For the pursuit of the enemy beyond Peronne the 11th
Brigade Group, with the addition of the
3rd
Pioneers as an extra
Infantry Battalion, and some British Horse Artillery, was organised
as an advance guard, and moved forward after very short
notice on the afternoon of the 5th. The 11th Field Company
attached
No.
2 section (Lt. Rhodes) to the 42nd Battalion in the
vanguard,
No.
1 section, with its own transport and
No.
2 transport
to the 41st Battalion (main body).
No.
3 section, with
Coy.

Headquarters, moved with the 11th Brigade H. Qrs., and
No.
4
was allotted to the special task of repairing a bridge at Peronne.
The move was slow and difficult owing to the congestion on the
roads, and if ever the enemy bombing âplanes missed an opportunity
they did so that night. Company Headquarters established
itself in a trench on the Northern slopes of Mt. St. Quentin, and it
says a great deal for the âBump of localityâ of the unit generally
that touch was maintained throughout, and not one of the numerous
detachments into which the Company was split got lost or
mislaid in the darkness, in strange country rendered most difficult
to traverse by old trenches and barbed wire.

It would be tedious to trace the movements of the various
sections and detachments during the next few days, when the
11th Brigade pushed rapidly forward on the heels of the enemy,
and captured Buire, Tincourt, and Roisel.
No.
2, split into detachments,
searched fruitlessly for booby traps and patched up
accommodation for Battalion Headquarters.
No.
3 did the same
for Brigade, and also repaired an important bridge near Mt. St.
Quentin and opened up a well or two.
No.
1, after some smaller
jobs, started work on repairing the river crossing at Courcelles Mill
leading to Cartigny, and was joined by
No.
4, whose bridge at
Peronne had been found not necessary, and who did quite a lot of
walking in the meantime. By noon on the 7th two bridges across
the branches of the Cologne stream, each strong enough to take
17-ton axle loads, had been completed. The transport which had
started from near Curlu succeeded in keeping in the race, and in
delivering supplies to the sections. Company Headquarters
moved to Three Tubs Wood, N.E. of Doingt, on the 6th, and on
the 8th to the outskirts of Boucly, across the river from Tincourt.
The Boche had been driven too rapidly from the neighbourhood of
Peronne and Doingt to have time to carry out demolitions; not only
were the bridges at Doingt untouched, but there were many useful
hutments in the vicinity. Further up the Cologne valley, however,
all the extensive hutments built by us about 1917 had been
burnt, and every bridge was destroyed between Doingt and Tincourt.
A small bath house near Brusle had been deemed worth
a charge of explosives.

Pg 43

In Buire an enamelled bath in an officersâ bathroom had been
thoroughly perforated with an axe, as had the large copper used
in conjunction with it. A number of small pumps were eagerly
rushed by the water supply sappers, but each had had an essential
lug or something of the sort broken off with a hammer. The
camp which the Company occupied near Boucly had not been
destroyed, possibly because the shelters were steel, the German
equivalent of our âLarge Englishâ or Elephant shelters. The
park in which this camp was situated was full of an extraordinary
assortment of German vehicles, many in good order. There were
wagons light, heavy, and extremely heavy; field cookers and field
bakery ovens, ambulances, patent telescopic observation towers
on wheels, and other curiosities.

The Company annexed from this collection a useful light
wagon and a brand-new cooker.

The villages in this area had all been systematically destroyed
by the Boche in his retreat of 1917, and had never been rebuilt.
It was quite easy to see that many of the houses had been burnt
out, and not destroyed by shell-fire. In some places all the trees
along the road side had been cut half through with axes, evidently
at the same period, and had subsequently had the gashes filled
with cement and strapped with iron. Most of them seemed to be
flourishing.

On the South side of the valley there were mine craters at
most road junctions. On the evening of the 7th, when
No.
3 section
moved to Boucly, its attention was drawn by a certain battalion
to a suspected mine on the road near Brusle. It was useless
explaining that the section with its transport had just marched
right over the place; the Battalion H. Qrs. was insistent, so the
section officer and a couple of his men went back to investigate.
The Boche had evidently intended planting some anti-tank mines,
and had dug holes across the road for them, but had been disturbed
or had changed his mind. There was nothing in the holes
but loose stones. Very early the next morning the O.C. of the
Company, on his way to visit
No.
3, saw the holes, and, not knowing
of the previous nightâs incident, got off his horse and investigated.
He had just finished raking the stones back when a Pioneer
Company Commander, whose men were filling in some craters a
little further back, panted up on a bicycle, saying he had heard
there was a mine about somewhere, and he was responsible for
roads, so he also investigated. Later in the morning the O.C. met
two subalterns of another Field Company, who asked if he had
heard anything of a road mine near Brusle, because they had
special orders from the C.R.E. to examine it thoroughly and
report. They were directed to the spot, and when last seen were
carefully removing the stones from the holes.

While the caution shewn in this was perhaps excessive, that
care was necessary was evidenced by the delay action mine which

Pg 44

blew up where the main road crossed the railway at Roisel, long
after the division had left the area.

The Causeway which crossed the valley from Buire to Brusle
had 5 gaps blown in it, and of these three were bridged by the Company
with strong footbridges. While the narrow gauge lines were
intact, the broad gauge railways had been thoroughly destroyed.
In one place there was a long length of track newly laid with heavy
rails branded Krupp 1917, and every rail had been broken in two
or three places with explosives. There was some satisfaction in
seeing the enemyâs own material treated in this way. A number
of deep wells on the South side of the valley had been blown in,
and a start had been made trying to repair one or two when the
Company was relieved by the 1st Field
Coy.
A.E.

This was on the 10th. Divisional Headquarters remained at
Doingt and work was started immediately repairing hutments in
the vicinity to accommodate the division. The Company made
itself a small camp to Courcelles Mill, and Headquarters moved
there on the 13th, and remained in this same place for a fortnight.
The enemy bombing from aeroplanes was very vicious in
the beginning of the period, but a number of his planes, caught in
our searchlights, were shot down in flames by our night flying
machines, with coloured lights shooting in all directions from the
burning Verey ammunition, greatly to the delight of the watching
crowds.

Quite an elaborate theatre for the âBlue Gumsâ was arranged
by
No.
4 section in Doingt, in an old hut, and the Company took
part in sports held by the 11th Brigade Group; with such amusement
added to an occasional aeroplane shooting display, time
passed quickly until orders to dump packs and surplus stores
heralded another move.

4.
The Hindenburg Line.

On the 27th of September the
3rd
Division left the Doingt
area and moved once more towards the line, to take its part in
another great attack. The 11th Field Company, with the 11th
Brigade Group, marched some 8 miles on the night of the
27th/28th to a bivouac about a mile West of Templeux-le-Guerard
at the head of the Cologne valley, while the transport settled at
Longavesnes.

This region at the time was held in force by the 27th U.S.
Division, with the 30th U.S. Division on its right. The general
position may be roughly described as follows:—

The enemy, endeavouring to stand on the line of early 1918—really
an outpost line to the main Hindenburg Line—had been
violently hurled back from it by an attack by the 1st and 4th
Australian Divisions, but was holding strongly to the Hindenburg
Line proper. Indeed, he had succeeded in recovering portion of
the outpost ridge, in the face of the American troops holding the

Pg 45

sector, and it was evident that he intended to offer a desperate
resistance. The Hindenburg Line east of Peronne, followed
generally the line of the St. Quentin Canal, but opposite the
sector held by the two American Divisions the canal ran into
a tunnel for some four miles from Bellicourt to Le Catelet, and
the line really constituted a very strongly defended bridge head
across this gap in the obstacle formed by the canal. To make
use of this natural bridge offered the best chance of quickly
penetrating the Hindenburg system with a large force of all arms,
but it was obvious that the enemy would be prepared for such an
attempt, and that the whole organisation, carefully thought out
during his previous occupation of this country, would be designed
to frustrate it.

The general plan of attack somewhat resembled that of
August 8th. The two American Divisions were to attack at dawn
under an intense barrage, and penetrate to the green line, over a
mile east of the canal, while the 5th Australian Division on the
right, and the
3rd
on the left, were to follow through and exploit
success to the âRed Line,â some three miles further.

The weather changed on the 28th, and became very cold.
This was really a blessing in disguise, as the supply of water to
such large concentrations of horses and men in this high, streamless,
country, where the wells and bores were so deep that only
those with power installations yielded a useful flow, was a difficult
problem.

Fleets of motor tanks supplied drinking water, but horses
had to travel long distances to watering points, and wait hours
in long queues, four deep, and extending literally miles along the
roads.

The early development of all sources of supply in any area
captured was thus of great importance, and
No.
2 section was
told off to this task in the zone allotted to the 11th Field Company,
with instructions to pay particular attention to the canal tunnel,
where springs were reported to exist.
No.
1 section was allotted
to roads,
No.
3 to clearing cross-country tracks for the artillery,
and
No.
4 was split up over the 11th Brigade and its battalions,
to search dugouts and look after accommodation generally.

The attack developed at dawn on Sept. 29th, but was not
immediately successful. Apparently the American assault troops
broke through the German line under cover of the barrage, but
neglected to âmop up.â The consequence was that large numbers
of Germans, as soon as the barrage and the closely following
attacking wave had passed, emerged from their numerous dugouts,
and manned machine guns and anti-tank defences. The
3rd

Division, moving forward in readiness, came under heavy artillery
and machine gun fire before it reached the old outpost line, and
was in effect faced with the task of attacking the complete Hindenburg
defences without the help of artillery, which could not

Pg 46

be used on account of the uncertainty as to the position of the
Americans. Under these circumstances, progress was naturally
slow. Fortunately the attack had been more successful on the
right divisional front, and the 44th Battalion on the extreme
right of the
3rd
Australian Division had succeeded in getting a
footing in the Hindenburg line proper, and making a flank to the
north. The sappers attached to the Battalion Headquarters
became involved in various tasks somewhat different to those for
which they had been allotted; an attempt to make the best use of
a stray tank led to some exciting incidents, which only ended when
the Boche, with a field gun at point blank range, put the tank
out of action.

No.
3 section succeeded in clearing a short length of artillery
track, but generally speaking, very little of the sapper programme
was accomplished, and the sections spent the night in the trenches
three-quarters of a mile south-east of Ronnsoy.

On the 30th the
3rd
Division continued the attack, and on the
1st of October succeeded in taking Bony, a small village right in
the main Hindenburg line and almost over the canal tunnel, chiefly
by means of persistent bombing along the network of trenches.
After this good progress was made. The sappers meanwhile had
discovered an extensive old British minefield, part of which had
been noticed by
No.
3 section on the 29th, when several of our
tanks were put out of action by it. Large numbers of mines were
removed and de-detonated from the field, which, curiously enough,
was marked by danger notices both in English and in German.
On the 1st a party of
No.
1 section made an investigation of the
whole of the canal tunnel, working from the Southern or Bellicourt
end. On the 2nd dugouts in the main Hindenburg line
were searched and cleared; a number of notice boards erected,
and an O.P. constructed East of Bony; while the investigation
of the tunnel was continued, through a number of the various
entrances made by the Germans along its length.

The tunnel, which is some four miles in length and 25 feet
in diameter, was dug in the time of Napoleon, and was found to
be in good order, and equipped with pumps (but without engines)
and piping to deliver water to the surface at a number of air
shafts. The water was tested, and found to be drinkable after
treatment, with the usual small quantity of chloride of lime, but
before the Company could do anything towards making it available,
the
3rd
Division was relieved on Oct.
3rd
by the 50th British
Division, and the
Coy.
evacuated the bivouac which it had occupied
at Toine Wood, close to the trenches in which the sections
sheltered on the night of the 29th. The Company Transport had
moved east of Templeux-le-Guerard on the 30th.

Exploration of the famous Hindenburg system had been full
of interest, not only because of the tunnel, with its German-made
stairway entrances, its concrete entrance defences, and its long

Pg 47

line of barges used for the living accommodation by the Boche
during his previous tenancy, but now damp and dilapidated; but
also on account of the fame attaching to the trench system itself.
To some extent this was disappointing; the trenches, although
very wide, were not well made, and the dugouts were numerous,
but not elaborate. The barbed wire, however, was astonishing in
its extent and density.

The casualties in this, destined to be the last action in which
the unit took part, were 11 wounded (including gas), of which one
subsequently died. For good work on the morning of the 29th
Sappers Chapman and Gallwey received the Military Medal.

On the evening of the
3rd
the whole Company bivouacked in
a pleasant, peaceful wood near Liercourt, and on the 5th entrained
at Peronne, less transport, which proceeded by road and joined
the unit in billets in the little village of La Leu, near Airaines, in
the lower Somme valley. On October 9th the Company moved to
Forceville, South of Abbeville, and was training and refitting in
this peaceful area when the armistice was signed.

As this is a war narrative it will not be necessary to describe
the change from military training to civil education; the drifting
away of members for early repatriation or non-military employment
in England; or the departure of demobilisation quotas and
the winding up of the Company; but a fitting termination may be
made by referring to the third and last Christmas spent in France.
The unit at the time was at BernaprÃ©, a few miles S.W. of Forceville,
where it had moved on Dec. 10th. Each section had a rough
and ready messroom, lavishly decorated with holly and mistletoe
for the occasion, and each was the scene of great feasting and jollification,
quite free at last from the black shadow of war, and
doubly pleasurable because of the conviction that the next Christmas
dinner would be in Australia. Geese and ducks in large numbers
and other good things to eat, together with liquids appropriate
to the season, were purchased from funds supplied by
friends in Australia.

The energetic efforts of the unitâs supporters, chiefly in South
Australia and in Queensland, resulted altogether in the sum of
Â£378, which was added by instalments to the Companyâs funds.
The possession of this money rendered possible Christmas feasts,
sports gatherings, and other distractions, and, above all, a regular
system of subsidies to section messes, which helped greatly to
improve the standard of living. This opportunity is gladly taken
of expressing the Companyâs sincere and grateful appreciation for
the labour of its friends.

EXPLANATORY NOTE.

A FIELD COMPANY, AUSTRALIAN ENGINEERS.

A Field Company, Australian Engineers, is almost exactly the
same as the corresponding unit of the Royal Engineers. There
are three Field Companies to a Division, grouped under the command
of the C.R.E. (Commanding Royal Engineers), who accompanies
Divisional Headquarters.

Each Field Company is normally commanded by a Major,
with a Captain as Second in Command, and includes 5 Subalterns,
9 Warrant Officers and Sergeants, 14 Corporals and Second Corporals,
46 mounted rank and file (mostly drivers), and 139 sappers.
As this last total has to supply all unit details, such as cooks, etc.,
it will be seen that the âman powerâ of a Field Company is comparatively
small even when at full strength. There are 75 horses
(some of which may be replaced by mules) on the establishment,
and also 29 bicycles.

The unit is organised into a Headquarters and 4 equal sections.
Each section, commanded by a subaltern, has a special
double tool cart (4 horses), containing a large assortment of engineer
tools and stores of all kinds, a G.S. limbered wagon (two
horses), and a pack animal. A considerable quantity of explosives
is carried by each section, also a lift and force pump and hose.

Company Headquarters has a G.S. wagon for technical stores
(four horses), a water cart (two horses), a mess cart (one horse),
and three bridging wagons (six horses each). Two of these carry
a pontoon each, together with superstructure, and the third carries
two Weldon trestles and superstructure. Altogether enough
material is carried for five spans of 15 feet each of bridge to carry
Field Artillery.

Sappers are armed with rifle and bayonets, drivers with rifle
only. Towards the end of the war each Company was issued with
five Lewis guns.

Printed by Meggy, Thompson, & Creasey,

98 High Street, Chelmsford.

Transcriber Note:

Except as noted below, dialect, obsolete and alternative spellings were left
unchanged. Inconsistent hyphenation was not changed. Obvious printing
errors, such as backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters,
were corrected. Final stops missing at the end of sentences and
abbreviations were added.

The following were changed:

— Removed duplicate âofâ from ââ¦ little village of RecquebrÅucq â¦â

— In Appendix IX, Other Ranks: changed âWaymf W.â to âWay, F.W.â; and
âTâransfâdâ to âTransfâdâ;

— The tables in Appendix IX. were split in
parts so that the data would display more readily on handheld
devices.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

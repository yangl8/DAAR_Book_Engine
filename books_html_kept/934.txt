THE
DARNED MOUNSEER

I
shipped
,
d’ye see, in a Revenue sloop,

And, off Cape Finisteere,

A merchantman we see,

A Frenchman, going free,

So we made for the bold
Mounseer,

D’ye see?

We made for the bold Mounseer!

But she proved to be a Frigate—and she up with her
ports,

And fires with a thirty-two!

It come uncommon near,

But we answered with a cheer,

Which paralysed the Parley-voo,

D’ye see?

Which paralysed the Parley-voo!

Then our Captain he up and he says, says he,

“That chap we need not
fear,—

We can take her, if we like,

She is sartin for to strike,

For she’s only a darned
Mounseer,

D’ye see?

She’s only a darned
Mounseer!

But to fight a French fal-lal—it’s like hittin’
of a gal—

It’s a lubberly thing for to
do;

For we, with all our faults,

Why, we’re sturdy British salts,

While she’s but a
Parley-voo,

D’ye see?

A miserable Parley-voo!”

So we up with our helm, and we scuds before the
breeze,

As we gives a compassionating
cheer;

Froggee answers with a shout

As he sees us go about,

Which was grateful of the poor
Mounseer,

D’ye see?

Which was grateful of the poor
Mounseer!

And I’ll wager in their joy they kissed each other’s
cheek

(Which is what them furriners
do),

And they blessed their lucky stars

We were hardy British tars

Who had pity on a poor
Parley-voo,

D’ye see?

Who had pity on a poor
Parley-voo!

p. 13
THE
ENGLISHMAN

He
is an
Englishman!

For he himself has said it,

And it’s greatly to his credit,

That he is an Englishman!

For he might have been a Roosian,

A French, or Turk, or Proosian,

Or perhaps Itali-an!

But in spite of all temptations,

To belong to other nations,

He remains an Englishman!

Hurrah!

For the true-born Englishman!

p. 16
THE
DISAGREEABLE MAN

If
you give me your
attention, I will tell you what I am:

I’m a genuine philanthropist—all other kinds are
sham.

Each little fault of temper and each social defect

In my erring fellow-creatures, I endeavour to correct.

To all their little weaknesses I open people’s eyes,

And little plans to snub the self-sufficient I devise;

I love my fellow-creatures—I do all the good I
can—

Yet everybody says I’m such a disagreeable man!

And I can’t think why!

To compliments inflated I’ve a withering
reply,

And vanity I always do my best to mortify;

A charitable action I can skilfully dissect;

And interested motives I’m delighted to detect.

I know everybody’s income and what everybody earns,

And I carefully compare it with the income-tax returns;

But to benefit humanity, however much I plan,

Yet everybody says I’m such a disagreeable man!

And I can’t think why!

I’m sure I’m no ascetic; I’m
as pleasant as can be;

You’ll always find me ready with a crushing repartee;

I’ve an irritating chuckle, I’ve a celebrated
sneer,

I’ve an entertaining snigger, I’ve a fascinating
leer;

To everybody’s prejudice I know a thing or two;

I can tell a woman’s age in half a minute—and I
do—

But although I try to make myself as pleasant as I can,

Yet everybody says I’m such a disagreeable man!

And I can’t think why!

p. 22
THE
COMING BY-AND-BY

Sad
is that
woman’s lot who, year by year,

Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear;

As Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,

Impatiently begins to “dim her eyes”!—

Herself compelled, in life’s uncertain gloamings,

To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved
“combings”—

Reduced, with rouge, lipsalve, and pearly grey,

To “make up” for lost time, as best she may!

Silvered is the raven
hair,

Spreading is the parting
straight,

Mottled the complexion fair,

Halting is the youthful gait,

Hollow is the laughter free,

Spectacled the limpid eye,

Little will be left of me,

In the coming by-and-by!

Fading is the taper waist—

Shapeless grows the shapely limb,

And although securely laced,

Spreading is the figure trim!

Stouter than I used to be,

Still more corpulent grow I—

There will be too much of me

In the coming by-and-by!

p. 26
THE
HIGHLY RESPECTABLE GONDOLIER

I
stole
the Prince,
and I brought him here,

And left him, gaily prattling

With a highly respectable Gondolier,

Who promised the Royal babe to rear,

And teach him the trade of a timoneer

With his own beloved bratling.

Both
of the babes were strong and stout,

And, considering all things, clever.

Of that there is no manner of doubt—

No probable, possible shadow of doubt—

No possible doubt whatever.

Time sped, and when at the end of a year

I sought that infant cherished,

That highly respectable Gondolier

Was lying a corpse on his humble bier—

I dropped a Grand Inquisitor’s tear—

That Gondolier had perished!

A
taste for drink, combined with gout,

Had doubled him up for ever.

Of
that
there is no manner of doubt—

No probable, possible shadow of doubt—

No possible doubt whatever.

But owing, I’m much disposed to fear,

To his terrible taste for tippling,

That highly respectable Gondolier

Could never declare with a mind sincere

Which of the two was his offspring dear,

And which the Royal stripling!

Which
was which he could never make out,

Despite his best endeavour.

Of
that
there is no manner of doubt—

No probable, possible shadow of doubt—

No possible doubt whatever.

The children followed his old career—

(This statement can’t be parried)

Of a highly respectable Gondolier:

Well, one of the two (who will soon be here)—

But
which
of the two is not quite clear—

Is the Royal Prince you married!

Search
in and out and round about

And you’ll discover never

A tale so free from every doubt—

All probable, possible shadow of doubt—

All possible doubt whatever!

p. 32
THE
FAIRY QUEEN’S SONG

Oh
, foolish fay,

Think you because

Man’s brave array

My bosom thaws

I’d disobey

Our fairy laws?

Because I fly

In realms above,

In tendency

To fall in love

Resemble I

The amorous dove?

Oh,
amorous dove!

Type of Ovidius Naso!

This heart of mine

Is soft as thine,

Although I dare not say so!

On fire that glows

With heat intense

I turn the hose

Of Common Sense,

And out it goes

At small expense!

We must maintain

Our fairy law;

That is the main

On which to draw—

In that we gain

A Captain Shaw.

Oh,
Captain Shaw!

Type of true love kept under!

Could thy Brigade

With cold cascade

Quench my great love, I wonder!

p. 38
IS
LIFE A BOON

Is
life a boon?

If so, it must befall

That Death, whene’er he
call,

Must call too soon.

Though fourscore years he give

Yet one would pray to live

Another moon!

What kind of plaint have I,

Who perish in July?

I might have had to die

Perchance in June!

Is life a thorn?

Then count it not a whit!

Man is well done with it;

Soon as he’s born

He should all means essay

To put the plague away;

And I, war-worn,

Poor captured fugitive,

My life most gladly give—

I might have had to live

Another morn!

p. 42
THE
MODERN MAJOR-GENERAL

I
am
the very
pattern of a modern Major-Gineral,

I’ve information vegetable, animal, and mineral;

I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights
historical,

From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;

I’m very well acquainted, too, with matters
mathematical,

I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical;

About binomial theorem I’m teeming with a lot o’
news,

With interesting facts about the square of the hypotenuse,

I’m very good at integral and differential calculus,

I know the scientific names of beings animalculous.

In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,

I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.

I know our mythic history—
King Arthur’s
and
Sir Caradoc’s
,

I answer hard acrostics, I’ve a pretty taste for
paradox;

I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of
Heliogabalus
,

In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous.

I tell undoubted
Raphaels
from
Gerard Dows
and
Zoffanies
,

I know the croaking chorus from the “Frogs” of
Aristophanes
;

Then I can hum a fugue, of which I’ve heard the
music’s din afore,

And whistle all the airs from that confounded nonsense
“Pinafore.”

Then I can write a washing-bill in Babylonic cuneiform,

And tell you every detail of
Caractacus’s
uniform.

In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,

I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.

In fact, when I know what is meant by
“mamelon” and “ravelin,”

When I can tell at sight a Chassepôt rifle from a
javelin,

When such affairs as
sorties
and surprises I’m more
wary at,

And when I know precisely what is meant by Commissariat,

When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern
gunnery,

When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery,

In short, when I’ve a smattering of elementary strategy,

You’ll say a better Major-Gener
al
has never

sat
a gee—

For my military knowledge, though I’m plucky and
adventury,

Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century.

But still in learning vegetable, animal, and mineral,

I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral!

p. 49
THE
HEAVY DRAGOON

If
you want a
receipt for that popular mystery,

Known to the world as a Heavy Dragoon,

Take all the remarkable people in history,

Rattle them off to a popular tune!

The pluck of
Lord Nelson
on board of
the
Victory
—

Genius of
Bismarck

devising a plan;

The humour of
Fielding
(which sounds
contradictory)—

Coolness of
Paget
about
to trepan—

The grace of
Mozart
, that unparalleled
musico—

Wit of
Macaulay
, who
wrote of
Queen Anne
—

The pathos of
Paddy
, as rendered by

Boucicault
—

Style of the
Bishop of Sodor and
Man
—

The dash of a D’
Orsay
, divested
of quackery—

Narrative powers of
Dickens
and
Thackeray
—

Victor Emmanuel
—peak-haunting

Peveril
—

Thomas Aquinas
, and
Doctor Sacheverell
—

Tupper
and
Tennyson
—
Daniel
Defoe
—

Anthony Trollope
and

Mister Guizot
!

Take of these elements all that is fusible,

Melt ’em all down in a pipkin or crucible,

Set ’em to simmer and take off the scum,

And a Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!

If you want a receipt for this soldierlike
paragon,

Get at the wealth of the
Czar
(if you can)—

The family pride of a Spaniard from Arragon—

Force of
Mephisto

pronouncing a ban—

A smack of
Lord Waterford
, reckless
and rollicky—

Swagger of
Roderick
,
heading his clan—

The keen penetration of
Paddington
Pollaky
—

Grace of an Odalisque on a divan—

The genius strategic of
Cæsar
or

Hannibal
—

Skill of
Lord Wolseley
in thrashing a
cannibal—

Flavour of
Hamlet
—the
Stranger
, a touch of him—

Little of
Manfred
(but not very much
of him)—

Beadle of Burlington—
Richardson’s
show—

Mr. Micawber
and
Madame Tussaud
!

Take of these elements all that is fusible—

Melt ’em all down in a pipkin or crucible—

Set ’em to simmer and take off the scum,

And a Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!

p. 56
PROPER
PRIDE

The
Sun, whose
rays

Are all ablaze

With ever-living glory,

Will not deny

His majesty—

He scorns to tell a story:

He won’t exclaim,

“I blush for shame,

So kindly be indulgent,”

But, fierce and bold,

In fiery gold,

He glories all effulgent!

I
mean to rule the earth,

As he the sky—

We really know
our worth,

The Sun and I!

Observe his flame,

That placid dame,

The Moon’s Celestial Highness;

There’s not a trace

Upon her face

Of diffidence or shyness:

She borrows light

That, through the night,

Mankind may all acclaim her!

And, truth to tell,

She lights up well,

So I, for one, don’t blame her!

Ah,
pray make no mistake,

We are not shy;

We’re very
wide awake,

The Moon and I!

p. 63
THE
POLICEMAN’S LOT

When
a felon’s
not engaged in his employment,

Or maturing his felonious little plans,

His capacity for innocent enjoyment

Is just as great as any honest man’s.

Our feelings we with difficulty smother

When constabulary duty’s to be done:

Ah, take one consideration with another,

A policeman’s lot is not a happy one!

When the enterprising burglar isn’t
burgling,

When the cut-throat isn’t occupied in
crime,

He loves to hear the little brook a-gurgling,

And listen to the merry village chime.

When the coster’s finished jumping on his mother,

He loves to lie a-basking in the sun:

Ah, take one consideration with another,

The policeman’s lot is not a happy one!

p. 69
THE
BAFFLED GRUMBLER

Whene’er
I poke

Sarcastic joke

Replete with
malice spiteful,

The people vile

Politely smile

And vote me quite delightful!

Now, when a wight

Sits up all night

Ill-natured jokes devising,

And all his wiles

Are met with smiles,

It’s hard, there’s no disguising!

Oh, don’t the days seem lank and long

When all goes right and nothing goes wrong,

And isn’t your life extremely flat

With nothing whatever to grumble at!

When German
bands,

From music stands

Play Wagner
imper
fect
ly—

I bid them go—

They don’t say no,

But off they trot directly!

The organ boys

They stop their noise

With readiness surprising,

And grinning herds

Of hurdy-gurds

Retire apologising!

Oh, don’t the days seem lank and long

When all goes right and nothing goes wrong,

And isn’t your life extremely flat

With nothing whatever to grumble at!

I’ve
offered gold,

In sums untold,

To all
who’d contradict me—

I’ve said I’d pay

A pound a day

To any one who kicked me—

I’ve bribed with toys

Great vulgar boys

To utter something spiteful,

But, bless you, no!

They
will
be so

Confoundedly politeful!

In short, these aggravating lads,

They tickle my tastes, they feed my fads,

They give me this and they give me that,

And I’ve nothing whatever to grumble at!

p. 74
THE
HOUSE OF PEERS

When
Britain really
ruled the waves—

(In good Queen Bess’s time)

The House of Peers made no pretence

To intellectual eminence,

Or scholarship sublime;

Yet Britain won her proudest bays

In good Queen Bess’s glorious days!

When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,

As every child can tell,

The House of Peers, throughout the war,

Did nothing in particular,

And did it very well;

Yet Britain set the world ablaze

In good King George’s glorious days!

And while the House of Peers withholds

Its legislative hand,

And noble statesmen do not itch

To interfere with matters which

They do not understand,

As bright will shine Great Britain’s rays,

As in King George’s glorious days!

p. 81
A
MERRY MADRIGAL

Brightly
dawns our
wedding day;

Joyous hour, we
give thee greeting!

Whither, whither
art thou fleeting?

Fickle moment, prithee stay!

What though
mortal joys be hollow?

Pleasures come,
if sorrows follow.

Though the tocsin sound, ere long,

Ding dong!  Ding dong!

Yet until the
shadows fall

Over one and
over all,

Sing a merry
madrigal—

Fal la!

Let us dry the ready tear;

Though the hours
are surely creeping,

Little need for
woeful weeping

Till the sad sundown is near.

All must sip the
cup of sorrow,

I to-day and
thou to-morrow:

This the close of every song—

Ding dong!  Ding dong!

What though
solemn shadows fall,

Sooner, later,
over all?

Sing a merry
madrigal—

Fal la!

p. 84
THE
DUKE AND THE DUCHESS

The Duke
.

Small titles and orders

For Mayors and Recorders

I get—and they’re
highly delighted.

M.P.s baronetted,

Sham Colonels gazetted,

And second-rate Aldermen
knighted.

Foundation-stone laying

I find very paying,

It adds a large sum to my
makings.

At charity dinners

The best of speech-spinners,

I get ten per cent on the
takings!

The Duchess
.

I present any lady

Whose conduct is shady

Or smacking of doubtful
propriety;

When Virtue would quash her

I take and whitewash her

And launch her in first-rate
society.

I recommend acres

Of clumsy dressmakers—

Their fit and their finishing
touches;

A sum in addition

They pay for permission

To say that they make for the
Duchess!

The Duke
.

Those pressing prevailers,

The ready-made tailors,

Quote me as their great
double-barrel;

I allow them to do so,

Though
Robinson Crusoe

Would jib at their wearing
apparel!

I sit, by selection,

Upon the direction

Of several Companies bubble;

As soon as they’re floated

I’m freely bank-noted—

I’m pretty well paid for my
trouble!

The Duchess
.

At middle-class party

I play at
écarté
—

And I’m by no means a
beginner;

To one of my station

The remuneration—

Five guineas a night and my
dinner.

I write letters blatant

On medicines patent—

And use any other you
mustn’t;

And vow my complexion

Derives its perfection

From somebody’s
soap—which it doesn’t.

The Duke
.

We’re ready as witness

To any one’s fitness

To fill any place or
preferment;

We’re often in waiting

At junket
fêting
,

And sometimes attend an
interment.

In short, if you’d kindle

The spark of a swindle,

Lure simpletons into your
clutches,

Or hoodwink a debtor,

You cannot do better

Than trot out a Duke or a
Duchess!

p. 92
EHEU
FUGACES—!

The
air is charged
with amatory numbers—

Soft madrigals, and dreamy lovers’ lays.

Peace, peace, old heart!  Why waken from its slumbers

The aching memory of the old, old days?

Time was when Love and I were well
acquainted;

Time was when we walked ever hand in hand;

A saintly youth, with worldly thought untainted,

None better loved than I in all the land!

Time was, when maidens of the noblest station,

Forsaking even military men,

Would gaze upon me, rapt in adoration—

Ah me, I was a fair young curate then!

Had I a headache? sighed the maids
assembled;

Had I a cold? welled forth the silent tear;

Did I look pale? then half a parish trembled;

And when I coughed all thought the end was near!

I had no care—no jealous doubts hung o’er
me—

For I was loved beyond all other men.

Fled gilded dukes and belted earls before me—

Ah me, I was a pale young curate then!

p.
99
THEY’LL NONE OF ’EM BE MISSED

As
some day it may
happen that a victim must be found,

I’ve got a little list—I’ve got a
little list

Of social offenders who might well be underground,

And who never would be missed—who never would
be missed!

There’s the pestilential nuisances who write for
autographs—

All people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs—

All children who are up in dates, and floor you with ’em
flat—

All persons who in shaking hands, shake hands with you like

that
—

And all third persons who on spoiling

tête-à-têtes
insist—

They’d none of ’em be
missed—they’d none of ’em be missed!

There’s the nigger serenader, and the
others of his race,

And the piano organist—I’ve got him on
the list!

And the people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face,

They never would be missed—they never would be
missed!

Then the idiot who praises, with enthusiastic tone,

All centuries but this, and every country but his own;

And the lady from the provinces, who dresses like a guy,

And who “doesn’t think she waltzes, but would rather
like to try”;

And that
fin-de-siècle
anomaly, the scorching
motorist—

I don’t think he’d be
missed—I’m
sure
he’d not be missed!

And that
Nisi Prius
nuisance, who just
now is rather rife,

The Judicial humorist—I’ve got

him
on the list!

All funny fellows, comic men, and clowns of private
life—

They’d none of ’em be
missed—they’d none of ’em be missed!

And apologetic statesmen of the compromising kind,

Such as—What-d’ye-call-him—Thing’em-Bob,
and likewise—Never-mind,

And ’St—’st—’st—and
What’s-his-name, and also—You-know-who—

(The task of filling up the blanks I’d rather leave to

you
!)

But it really doesn’t matter whom you put upon the list,

For they’d none of ’em be
missed—they’d none of ’em be missed!

p. 106
GIRL
GRADUATES

They
intend to send
a wire

To the moon;

And they’ll set the Thames on fire

Very soon;

Then they learn to make silk purses

With their rigs

From the ears of
Lady Circe’s

Piggy-wigs.

And weasels at their slumbers

They’ll trepan;

To get sunbeams from cu
cum
bers

They’ve a plan.

They’ve a firmly rooted notion

They can cross the Polar Ocean,

And they’ll find Perpetual Motion

If they can!

These are
the phenomena

That every pretty domina

Hopes that we
shall see

At this
Universitee!

As for fashion, they forswear it,

So they say,

And the circle—they will square it

Some fine day;

Then the little pigs they’re teaching

For to fly;

And the niggers they’ll be bleaching

By-and-by!

Each newly joined aspirant

To the clan

Must repudiate the tyrant

Known as Man;

They mock at him and flout him,

For they do not care about him,

And they’re “going to do without him”

If they can!

These are
the phenomena

That every pretty domina

Hopes that we
shall see

At this

BRAID THE RAVEN HAIR

Braid
the raven
hair,

Weave the supple tress,

Deck the maiden fair

In her loveliness;

Paint the pretty face,

Dye the coral lip,

Emphasise the grace

Of her ladyship!

Art and nature, thus allied,

Go to make a pretty bride!

Sit with downcast eye,

Let it brim with dew;

Try if you can cry,

We will do so, too.

When you’re summoned, start

Like a frightened roe;

Flutter, little heart,

Colour, come and go!

Modesty at marriage tide

Well becomes a pretty bride!

THE
WORKING MONARCH

Rising
early in the
morning,

We proceed to light the fire,

Then our Majesty adorning

In its work-a-day attire,

We embark without delay

On the duties of the day.

First, we polish off some batches

Of political despatches,

And foreign politicians
circumvent;

Then, if business isn’t heavy,

We may hold a Royal
levée
,

Or ratify some Acts of
Parliament:

Then we probably review the household troops—

With the usual “Shalloo humps” and “Shalloo
hoops!”

Or receive with ceremonial and state

An interesting Eastern Potentate.

After that we generally

Go and dress our private

valet
—

(It’s a rather nervous duty—he a
touchy little man)—

Write some letters literary

For our private
secretary—

(He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.)

Then, in view of cravings
inner,

We go down and order dinner;

Or we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate—

Spend an hour in titivating

All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;

Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.

Oh, philosophers may sing

Of the troubles of a King,

Yet the duties are delightful, and
the privileges great;

But the privilege and pleasure

That we treasure beyond measure

Is to run on little errands for
the Ministers of State!

After luncheon (making merry

On a bun and glass of sherry),

If we’ve nothing in
particular to do,

We may make a Proclamation,

Or receive a Deputation—

Then we possibly create a Peer or
two.

Then we help a fellow-creature on his path

With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath:

Or we dress and toddle off in semi-State

To a festival, a function, or a
fête
.

Then we go and stand as sentry

At the Palace (private entry),

Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and fro,

While the warrior on duty

Goes in search of beer and
beauty

(And it generally happens that he hasn’t far to go).

He relieves us, if he’s
able,

Just in time to lay the table.

Then we dine and serve the coffee; and at
half-past twelve or one,

With a pleasure that’s
emphatic;

Then we seek our little attic

With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done.

Oh, philosophers may sing

Of the troubles of a King,

But of pleasures there are many and of troubles there are
none;

And the culminating pleasure

That we treasure beyond measure

Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!

THE
APE AND THE LADY

A
Lady
fair, of
lineage high,

Was loved by an Ape, in the days gone by—

The Maid was radiant as the sun,

The Ape was a most unsightly one—

So it would not do—

His scheme fell through;

For the Maid, when his love took formal shape,

Expressed such terror

At his monstrous error,

That he stammered an apology and made his ’scape,

The picture of a disconcerted Ape.

With a view to rise in the social scale,

He shaved his bristles, and he docked his tail,

He grew moustachios, and he took his tub,

And he paid a guinea to a toilet club.

But it would not do,

The scheme fell through—

For the Maid was Beauty’s fairest Queen,

With golden tresses,

Like a real princess’s,

While the Ape, despite his razor keen,

Was the apiest Ape that ever was seen!

He bought white ties, and he bought dress
suits,

He crammed his feet into bright tight boots,

And to start his life on a brand-new plan,

He christened himself Darwinian Man!

But it would not do,

The scheme fell through—

For the Maiden fair, whom the monkey craved,

Was a radiant Being,

With a brain far-seeing—

While a Man, however well-behaved,

At best is only a monkey shaved!

p. 130
ONLY
ROSES

To
a garden full of
posies

Cometh one to gather flowers;

And he wanders through its bowers

Toying with the wanton roses,

Who, uprising from their beds,

Hold on high their shameless heads

With their pretty lips a-pouting,

Never doubting—never doubting

That for Cytherean posies

He would gather aught but roses.

In a nest of weeds and nettles,

Lay a violet, half hidden;

Hoping that his glance unbidden

Yet might fall upon her petals.

Though she lived alone, apart,

Hope lay nestling at her heart,

But, alas! the cruel awaking

Set her little heart a-breaking,

For he gathered for his posies

Only roses—only roses!

p. 136
THE
ROVER’S APOLOGY

Oh
, gentlemen,
listen, I pray;

Though I own that my heart has been ranging,

Of nature the laws I obey,

For nature is constantly changing.

The moon in her phases is found,

The time and the wind and the weather,

The months in succession come round,

And you don’t find two Mondays together.

Consider the
moral, I pray,

Nor bring a young fellow to sorrow,

Who loves this
young lady to-day,

And loves that young lady to-morrow!

You cannot eat breakfast all day.

Nor is it the act of a sinner,

When breakfast is taken away,

To turn your attention to dinner;

And it’s not in the range of belief

That you could hold him as a glutton,

Who, when he is tired of beef,

Determines to tackle the mutton.

But this I am
ready to say,

If it will diminish their sorrow,

I’ll marry
this lady to-day,

And I’ll marry that lady to-morrow!

p. 143
AN
APPEAL

Oh
! is there not one
maiden breast

Which does not feel the moral beauty

Of making worldly interest

Subordinate to sense of duty?

Who would not give up willingly

All matrimonial ambition

To rescue such a one as I

From his unfortunate position?

Oh, is there not one maiden here,

Whose homely face and bad complexion

Have caused all hopes to disappear

Of ever winning man’s affection?

To such a one, if such there be,

I swear by heaven’s arch above you,

If you will cast your eyes on me,—

However plain you be—I’ll love you!

p. 146
THE
REWARD OF MERIT

Dr. Belville
was
regarded as the
Crichton
of his
age:

His tragedies were reckoned much too thoughtful for the stage;

His poems held a noble rank, although it’s very true

That, being very proper, they were read by very few.

He was a famous Painter, too, and shone upon the
“line,”

And even
Mr. Ruskin
came and
worshipped at his shrine;

But, alas, the school he followed was heroically high—

The kind of Art men rave about, but very seldom buy;

And everybody said

“How can he be repaid—

This very great—this very good—this very gifted
man?”

But nobody could hit upon a practicable plan!

He was a great Inventor, and discovered, all
alone,

A plan for making everybody’s fortune but his own;

For, in business, an Inventor’s little better than a
fool,

And my highly-gifted friend was no exception to the rule.

His poems—people read them in the Quarterly
Reviews—

His pictures—they engraved them in the
Illustrated
News
—

His inventions—they, perhaps, might have enriched him by
degrees,

But all his little income went in Patent Office fees;

And everybody said

“How can he be repaid—

This very great—this very good—this very gifted
man?”

But nobody could hit upon a practicable plan!

At last the point was given up in absolute
despair,

When a distant cousin died, and he became a millionaire,

With a county seat in Parliament, a moor or two of grouse,

And a taste for making inconvenient speeches in the House!

Then
it flashed upon Britannia that the fittest of
rewards

Was, to take him from the Commons and to put him in the Lords!

And who so fit to sit in it, deny it if you can,

As this very great—this very good—this very gifted
man?

(Though I’m more than half afraid

That it sometimes may be said

That we never should have revelled in that source of proper
pride,

However great his merits—if his cousin hadn’t
died!)

p. 153
THE
MAGNET AND THE CHURN

A
Magnet
hung in a
hardware shop,

And all around was a loving crop

Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,

Offering love for all their lives;

But for iron the Magnet felt no whim,

Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him,

From needles and nails and knives he’d turn,

For he’d set his love on a Silver Churn!

His most
æsthetic,

Very magnetic

Fancy took this turn—

“If I can
wheedle

A knife or
needle,

Why not a Silver Churn?”

And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,

The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,

The pen-knives felt “shut up,” no doubt,

The scissors declared themselves “cut out,”

The kettles they boiled with rage, ’tis said,

While every nail went off its head,

And hither and thither began to roam,

Till a hammer came up—and drove it home,

While this
magnetic

Peripatetic

Lover he lived to learn,

By no
endeavour,

Can Magnet
ever

Attract a Silver Churn!

p. 161
THE
FAMILY FOOL

Oh
! a private
buffoon is a light-hearted loon,

If you listen to popular rumour;

From morning to night he’s so joyous and bright,

And he bubbles with wit and good humour!

He’s so quaint and so terse, both in prose and in verse;

Yet though people forgive his transgression,

There are one or two rules that all Family Fools

Must observe, if they love their profession.

There are one or two rules,

Half-a-dozen, maybe,

That all family fools,

Of whatever degree,

Must observe if
they love their profession.

If you wish to succeed as a jester,
you’ll need

To consider each person’s auricular:

What is all right for B would quite scandalise C

(For C is so very particular);

And D may be dull, and E’s very thick skull

Is as empty of brains as a ladle;

While F is F sharp, and will cry with a carp,

That he’s known your best joke from his
cradle!

When your humour they flout,

You can’t let yourself go;

And it
does
put you out

When a person says, “Oh!

I have known
that old joke from my cradle!”

If your master is surly, from getting up
early

(And tempers are short in the morning),

An inopportune joke is enough to provoke

Him to give you, at once, a month’s
warning.

Then if you refrain, he is at you again,

For he likes to get value for money:

He’ll ask then and there, with an insolent stare,

“If you know that you’re paid to be
funny?”

It adds to the tasks

Of a merryman’s place,

When your principal asks,

With a scowl on his face,

If you know that
you’re paid to be funny?

Comes a Bishop, maybe, or a solemn
D.D.—

Oh, beware of his anger provoking!

Better not pull his hair—don’t stick pins in his
chair;

He won’t understand practical joking.

If the jests that you crack have an orthodox smack,

You may get a bland smile from these sages;

But should it, by chance, be imported from France,

Half-a-crown is stopped out of your wages!

It’s a general rule,

Though your zeal it may quench,

If the Family Fool

Makes a joke that’s
too
French,

Half-a-crown is
stopped out of his wages!

Though your head it may rack with a bilious
attack,

And your senses with toothache you’re
losing,

And you’re mopy and flat—they don’t fine you
for that

If you’re properly quaint and amusing!

Though your wife ran away with a soldier that day,

And took with her your trifle of money;

Bless your heart, they don’t mind—they’re
exceedingly kind—

They don’t blame you—as long as
you’re funny!

It’s a comfort to feel

If your partner should flit,

Though
you
suffer a deal,

They
don’t mind it a bit—

They don’t
blame you—so long as you’re funny!

p. 169
SANS
SOUCI

I
cannot
tell what
this love may be

That cometh to all but not to me.

It cannot be kind as they’d imply,

Or why do these gentle ladies sigh?

It cannot be joy and rapture deep,

Or why do these gentle ladies weep?

It cannot be blissful, as ’tis said,

Or why are their eyes so wondrous red?

If love is a thorn, they show no wit

Who foolishly hug and foster it.

If love is a weed, how simple they

Who gather and gather it, day by day!

If love is a nettle that makes you smart,

Why do you wear it next your heart?

And if it be neither of these, say I,

Why do you sit and sob and sigh?

p. 175
A
RECIPE

Take
a pair of
sparkling eyes,

Hidden, ever and anon,

In a merciful eclipse—

Do not heed their mild surprise—

Having passed the Rubicon.

Take a pair of rosy lips;

Take a figure trimly planned—

Such as admiration whets

(Be particular in this);

Take a tender little hand,

Fringed with dainty
fingerettes,

Press it—in parenthesis;—

Take all these, you lucky man—

Take and keep them, if you can.

Take a pretty little cot—

Quite a miniature affair—

Hung about with trellised vine,

Furnish it upon the spot

With the treasures rich and
rare

I’ve endeavoured to define.

Live to love and love to live—

You will ripen at your ease,

Growing on the sunny side—

Fate has nothing more to give.

You’re a dainty man to
please

If you are not satisfied.

Take my counsel, happy man:

Act upon it, if you can!

THE
MERRYMAN AND HIS MAID

He
.
I
have
a song to sing, O!

She
.
Sing me your song, O!

He
.
It is sung to the moon

By a love-lorn loon,

Who fled from the mocking throng,
O!

It’s the song of a merryman, moping mum,

Whose soul was sad, whose glance was glum,

Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye.

Heighdy! heighdy!

Misery me—lackadaydee!

He sipped no sup, and he craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye!

She
.
I have a song to sing, O!

He
.
Sing me your song, O!

She
.
It is sung with the ring

Of the song maids sing

Who love with a love life-long,
O!

It’s the song of a merrymaid, peerly proud,

Who loved a lord, and who laughed aloud

At the moan of the merryman, moping mum,

Whose soul was sore, whose glance was glum,

Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye!

Heighdy! heighdy!

Misery me—lackadaydee!

He sipped no sup, and he craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye!

He
.
I have a song to sing, O!

She
.
Sing me your song, O!

He
.
It is sung to the knell

Of a churchyard bell,

And a doleful dirge, ding dong,
O!

It’s a song of a popinjay, bravely born,

Who turned up his noble nose with scorn

At the humble merrymaid, peerly proud,

Who loved that lord, and who laughed aloud

At the moan of the merryman, moping mum,

Whose soul was sad, whose glance was glum,

Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye!

Heighdy! heighdy!

Misery me—lackadaydee!

He sipped no sup, and he craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a
ladye!

She
.
I have a song to sing, O!

He
.
Sing me your song, O!

She
.
It is sung with a sigh

And a tear in the eye,

For it tells of a righted wrong,
O!

It’s a song of a merrymaid, once so gay,

Who turned on her heel and tripped away

From the peacock popinjay, bravely born,

Who turned up his noble nose with scorn

At the humble heart that he did not prize;

And it tells how she begged, with downcast eyes,

For the love of a merryman, moping mum,

Whose soul was sad, whose glance was glum,

Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,

As he sighed for the love of a ladye!

Both
.
Heighdy! heighdy!

Misery me—lackadaydee!

His pains were o’er, and he sighed no more.

For he lived in the love of a
ladye!

THE
SUSCEPTIBLE CHANCELLOR

The
law is the true
embodiment

Of everything that’s excellent.

It has no kind of fault or flaw,

And I, my lords, embody the Law.

The constitutional guardian I

Of pretty young Wards in Chancery,

All very agreeable girls—and none

Is over the age of twenty-one.

A pleasant occupation for

A rather susceptible Chancellor!

But though the compliment implied

Inflates me with legitimate pride,

It nevertheless can’t be denied

That it has its inconvenient side.

For I’m not so old, and not so plain,

And I’m quite prepared to marry again,

But there’d be the deuce to pay in the Lords

If I fell in love with one of my Wards:

Which rather tries my temper, for

I’m
such
a susceptible Chancellor!

And every one who’d marry a Ward

Must come to me for my accord:

So in my court I sit all day,

Giving agreeable girls away,

With one for him—and one for he—

And one for you—and one for ye—

And one for thou—and one for thee—

But never, oh never a one for me!

Which is exasperating, for

A highly susceptible Chancellor!

WHEN
A MERRY MAIDEN MARRIES

When
a merry maiden
marries,

Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;

Every sound becomes a song,

All is right and nothing’s wrong!

From to-day and ever after

Let your tears be tears of laughter—

Every sigh that finds a vent

Be a sigh of sweet content!

When you marry merry maiden,

Then the air with love is laden;

Every flower is a rose,

Every goose becomes a swan,

Every kind of trouble goes

Where the last year’s snows
have gone;

Sunlight takes the place of shade

When you marry merry maid!

When a merry maiden marries

Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;

Every sound becomes a song,

All is right, and nothing’s wrong.

Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow,

Get ye gone until to-morrow;

Jealousies in grim array,

Ye are things of yesterday!

When you marry merry maiden,

Then the air with joy is laden;

All the corners of the earth

Ring with music sweetly played,

Worry is melodious mirth,

Grief is joy in masquerade;

Sullen night is laughing day—

All the year is merry May!

THE
BRITISH TAR

A
British
tar is a
soaring soul,

As free as a mountain bird,

His energetic fist should be ready to resist

A dictatorial word.

His nose should pant and his lip should curl,

His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl,

His bosom should heave and his heart should glow,

And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down blow.

His eyes should flash with an inborn fire,

His brow with scorn be rung;

He never should bow down to a domineering frown,

Or the tang of a tyrant tongue.

His foot should stamp and his throat should growl,

His hair should twirl and his face should scowl;

His eyes should flash and his breast protrude,

And this should be his customary attitude!

p. 209
A
MAN WHO WOULD WOO A FAIR MAID

A
man
who would woo
a fair maid,

Should ’prentice himself to the trade;

And study all day,

In methodical way,

How to flatter, cajole, and persuade.

He should ’prentice himself at fourteen

And practise from morning to e’en;

And when he’s of age,

If he will, I’ll engage,

He may capture the heart of a queen!

It is purely a
matter of skill,

Which all may
attain if they will:

But every Jack

He must study the knack

If he wants to
make sure of his Jill!

If he’s made the best use of his time,

His twig he’ll so carefully lime

That every bird

Will come down at his word.

Whatever its plumage and clime.

He must learn that the thrill of a touch

May mean little, or nothing, or much;

It’s an instrument rare,

To be handled with care,

And ought to be treated as such.

It is purely a
matter of skill,

Which all may
attain if they will:

But every Jack,

He must study the knack

If he wants to
make sure of his Jill!

Then a glance may be timid or free;

It will vary in mighty degree,

From an impudent stare

To a look of despair

That no maid without pity can see.

And a glance of despair is no guide—

It may have its ridiculous side;

It may draw you a tear

Or a box on the ear;

You can never be sure till you’ve tried.

It is purely a
matter of skill,

Which all may
attain if they will:

But every Jack

He must study the knack

If he wants to
make sure of his Jill!

THE
SORCERER’S SONG

Oh
! my name is
John Wellington Wells
—

I’m a dealer in magic and spells,

In blessings and curses,

And ever-filled purses,

In prophecies, witches, and knells!

If you want a proud foe to “make tracks”—

If you’d melt a rich uncle in wax—

You’ve but to look in

On our resident Djinn,

Number seventy, Simmery Axe.

We’ve a first-class assortment of
magic;

And for raising a posthumous shade

With effects that are comic or tragic,

There’s no cheaper house in the trade.

Love-philtre—we’ve quantities of it;

And for knowledge if any one burns,

We keep an extremely small prophet, a prophet

Who brings us unbounded returns:

For he can
prophesy

With a wink

of
his eye,

Peep with
security

Into
futurity,

Sum up your
history,

Clear up a
mystery,

Humour
proclivity

For a
nativity.

With mirrors so
magical,

Tetrapods
tragical,

Bogies
spectacular,

Answers
oracular,

Facts
astronomical,

Solemn or
comical,

And, if you want
it, he

Makes a reduction on taking a quantity!

Oh!

If any one anything lacks,

He’ll find it all ready in stacks,

If he’ll only look in

On the resident Djinn,

Number seventy, Simmery Axe!

He can
raise you hosts,

Of ghosts,

And that without reflectors;

And creepy things

With wings,

And gaunt and grisly spectres!

He can fill you crowds

Of shrouds,

And horrify you vastly;

He can rack your brains

With chains,

And gibberings grim and ghastly.

Then, if you plan it, he

Changes organity

With an urbanity,

Full of Satanity,

Vexes humanity

With an inanity

Fatal to vanity—

Driving your foes to the verge of insanity.

Barring tautology,

In demonology,

’Lectro biology,

Mystic nosology,

Spirit philology,

High class astrology,

Such is his knowledge, he

Isn’t the man to require an apology

Oh!

My name is
John Wellington Wells
,

I’m a dealer in magic and spells,

In blessings and curses,

And ever-filled purses—

In prophecies, witches, and knells.

If any one anything lacks,

He’ll find it all ready in stacks,

If he’ll only look in

On the resident Djinn,

Number seventy, Simmery Axe!

THE
FICKLE BREEZE

Sighing
softly to
the river

Comes the loving breeze,

Setting nature all a-quiver,

Rustling through the trees!

And the brook in rippling measure

Laughs for very love,

While the poplars, in their pleasure,

Wave their arms above!

River, river,
little river,

May thy loving
prosper ever.

Heaven speed
thee, poplar tree,

May thy wooing
happy be!

Yet, the breeze is but a rover,

When he wings away,

Brook and poplar mourn a lover!

Sighing well-a-day!

Ah, the doing and undoing

That the rogue could tell!

When the breeze is out a-wooing,

Who can woo so well?

Pretty brook,
thy dream is over,

For thy love is
but a rover!

Sad the lot of
poplar trees,

Courted by the
fickle breeze!

THE
FIRST LORD’S SONG

When
I was a lad I
served a term

As office boy to an Attorney’s firm;

I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,

And I polished up the handle of the big front door.

I polished up that handle so
successfullee,

That now I am the Ruler of the
Queen’s Navee!

As office boy I made such a mark

That they gave me the post of a junior clerk;

I served the writs with a smile so bland,

And I copied all the letters in a big round hand.

I copied all the letters in a hand
so free,

That now I am the Ruler of the
Queen’s Navee!

In serving writs I made such a name

That an articled clerk I soon became;

I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit

For the Pass Examination at the Institute:

And that Pass Examination did so
well for me,

That now I am the Ruler of the
Queen’s Navee!

Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip

That they took me into the partnership,

And that junior partnership I ween,

Was the only ship that I ever had seen:

But that kind of ship so suited
me,

That now I am the Ruler of the
Queen’s Navee!

I grew so rich that I was sent

By a pocket borough into Parliament;

I always voted at my Party’s call,

And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.

I thought so little, they rewarded
me,

By making me the Ruler of the
Queen’s Navee!

Now, landsmen all, whoever you may be,

If you want to rise to the top of the tree—

If your soul isn’t fettered to an office stool,

Be careful to be guided by this golden rule—

Stick close to your desks and

never go to sea
,

And you all may be Rulers of the
Queen’s Navee!

WOULD YOU KNOW?

Would
you know the
kind of maid

Sets my heart a flame-a?

Eyes must be downcast and staid,

Cheeks must flush for shame-a!

She may neither
dance nor sing,

But, demure in
everything,

Hang her head in
modest way

With pouting
lips that seem to say,

“Kiss me,
kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,

Though I die of
shame-a!”

Please you, that’s the kind of maid

Sets my heart a
flame-a!

When a maid is bold and gay

With a tongue goes clang-a,

Flaunting it in brave array,

Maiden may go hang-a!

Sunflower gay
and hollyhock

Never shall my
garden stock;

Mine the
blushing rose of May,

With pouting
lips that seem to say

“Oh, kiss
me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,

Though I die for
shame-a!”

Please you, that’s the kind of maid

Sets my heart a
flame-a!

SPECULATION

Comes
a train of
little ladies

From scholastic trammels free,

Each a little bit afraid is,

Wondering what the world can be!

Is it but a world of trouble—

Sadness set to song?

Is its beauty but a bubble

Bound to break ere long?

Are its palaces and pleasures

Fantasies that fade?

And the glory of its treasures

Shadow of a shade?

Schoolgirls we, eighteen and under,

From scholastic trammels free,

And we wonder—how we wonder!—

What on earth the world can be!

AH
ME!

When
maiden loves,
she sits and sighs,

She wanders to and fro;

Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,

And to all questions she replies,

With a sad heigho!

’Tis but a little
word—“heigho!”

So soft, ’tis scarcely
heard—“heigho!”

An idle breath—

Yet life and death

May hang upon a maid’s
“heigho!”

When maiden loves, she mopes apart,

As owl mopes on a tree;

Although she keenly feels the smart,

She cannot tell what ails her heart,

With its sad “Ah me!”

’Tis but a foolish
sigh—“Ah me!”

Born but to droop and
die—“Ah me!”

Yet all the sense

Of eloquence

Lies hidden in a maid’s
“Ah me!”

THE
DUKE OF PLAZA-TORO

In
enterprise of
martial kind,

When there was any fighting,

He led his regiment from behind

(He found it less exciting).

But when away his regiment ran,

His place was at the fore,
O—

That celebrated,

Cultivated,

Underrated

Nobleman,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

In the first and foremost flight, ha, ha!

You always found that knight, ha, ha!

That celebrated,

Cultivated,

Underrated

Nobleman,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

When, to evade Destruction’s hand,

To hide they all proceeded,

No soldier in that gallant band

Hid half as well as he did.

He lay concealed throughout the war,

And so preserved his gore, O!

That unaffected,

Undetected,

Well connected

Warrior,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

In every doughty deed, ha, ha!

He always took the lead, ha, ha!

That unaffected,

Undetected,

Well connected

Warrior,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

When told that they would all be shot

Unless they left the service,

That hero hesitated not,

So marvellous his nerve is.

He sent his resignation in,

The first of all his corps, O!

That very knowing,

Overflowing,

Easy-going

Paladin,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

To men of grosser clay, ha, ha!

He always showed the way, ha, ha!

That very knowing,

Overflowing,

Easy-going

Paladin,

The Duke of Plaza-Toro!

THE
ÆSTHETE

If
you’re
anxious for to shine in the high æsthetic line, as a man of
culture rare,

You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms, and
plant them everywhere.

You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases of
your complicated state of mind

(The meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter
of a transcendental kind).

And every one will say,

As you walk your mystic way,

“If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for

me
,

Why, what a very singularly deep young man this deep young man
must be!”

Be eloquent in praise of the very dull old days
which have long since passed away,

And convince ’em, if you can, that the reign of good
Queen Anne
was Culture’s palmiest
day.

Of course you will pooh-pooh whatever’s fresh and new, and
declare it’s crude and mean,

And that Art stopped short in the cultivated court of the
Empress Josephine
.

And every one will say,

As you walk your mystic way,

“If that’s not good enough for him which is good
enough for
me
,

Why, what a very cultivated kind of youth this kind of youth must
be!”

Then a sentimental passion of a vegetable
fashion must excite your languid spleen,

An attachment
à la
Plato for a bashful young
potato, or a not-too-French French bean.

Though the Philistines may jostle, you will rank as an apostle in
the high æsthetic band,

If you walk down Piccadilly with a poppy or a lily in your
mediæval hand.

And every one will say,

As you walk your flowery way,

“If he’s content with a vegetable love which would
certainly not suit
me
,

Why, what a most particularly pure young man this pure young man
must be!”

p. 278
SAID
I TO MYSELF, SAID I

When
I went to the
Bar as a very young man

(Said I to myself—said
I),

I’ll work on a new and original plan

(Said I to myself—said
I),

I’ll never assume that a rogue or a thief

Is a gentleman worthy implicit belief,

Because his attorney, has sent me a brief

(Said I to myself—said
I!)

I’ll never throw dust in a
juryman’s eyes

(Said I to myself—said
I),

Or hoodwink a judge who is not over-wise

(Said I to myself—said
I),

Or assume that the witnesses summoned in force

In Exchequer, Queen’s Bench, Common Pleas, or Divorce,

Have perjured themselves as a matter of course

(Said I to myself—said
I!)

Ere I go into court I will read my brief
through

(Said I to myself—said
I),

And I’ll never take work I’m unable to do

(Said I to myself—said
I).

My learned profession I’ll never disgrace

By taking a fee with a grin on my face,

When I haven’t been there to attend to the case

(Said I to myself—said
I!)

In other professions in which men engage

(Said I to myself—said
I),

The Army, the Navy, the Church, and the Stage,

(Said I to myself—said
I),

Professional licence, if carried too far,

Your chance of promotion will certainly mar—

And I fancy the rule might apply to the Bar

(Said I to myself—said
I!)

SORRY HER LOT

Sorry
her lot who
loves too well,

Heavy the heart that hopes but vainly,

Sad are the sighs that own the spell

Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly;

Heavy the sorrow that bows the
head

When Love is alive and Hope is
dead!

Sad is the hour when sets the Sun—

Dark is the night to Earth’s poor
daughters,

When to the ark the wearied one

Flies from the empty waste of waters!

Heavy the sorrow that bows the
head

When Love is alive and Hope is
dead!

THE
CONTEMPLATIVE SENTRY

When
all night long
a chap remains

On sentry-go, to chase monotony

He exercises of his brains,

That is, assuming that he’s got any.

Though never nurtured in the lap

Of luxury, yet I admonish you,

I am an intellectual chap,

And think of things that would astonish you.

I often think
it’s comical

How Nature always does contrive

That every boy
and every gal,

That’s born into the world alive,

Is either a
little Liberal,

Or else a little Conservative!

Fal lal la!

When in that house M.P.’s divide,

If they’ve a brain and cerebellum, too,

They’ve got to leave that brain outside,

And vote just as their leaders tell ’em to.

But then the prospect of a lot

Of statesmen, all in close proximity,

A-thinking for themselves, is what

No man can face with equanimity.

Then let’s
rejoice with loud Fal lal

That Nature wisely does contrive

That every boy
and every gal,

That’s born into the world alive,

Is either a
little Liberal,

Or else a little Conservative!

Fal lal la!

THE
PHILOSOPHIC PILL

I’ve
wisdom
from the East and from the West,

That’s subject to no academic rule;

You may find it in the jeering of a jest,

Or distil it from the folly of a fool.

I can teach you with a quip, if I’ve a mind;

I can trick you into learning with a laugh;

Oh, winnow all my folly, and you’ll find

A grain or two of truth among the chaff!

I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,

The upstart I can wither with a whim;

He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,

But his laughter has an echo that is grim.

When they’ve offered to the world in merry guise,

Unpleasant truths are swallowed with a
will—

For he who’d make his fellow-creatures wise

Should always gild the philosophic pill!

BLUE
BLOOD

Spurn
not the nobly
born

With love affected,

Nor treat with virtuous scorn

The well connected.

High rank involves no shame—

We boast an equal claim

With him of humble name

To be respected!

Blue blood!  Blue blood!

When virtuous love is sought,

Thy power is naught,

Though dating from the Flood,

Blue blood!

Spare us the bitter pain

Of stern denials,

Nor with low-born disdain

Augment our trials.

Hearts just as pure and fair

May beat in Belgrave Square

As in the lowly air

Of Seven Dials!

Blue blood!  Blue blood!

Of what avail art thou

To serve me now?

Though dating from the Flood,

Blue blood!

THE
JUDGE’S SONG

When
I, good
friends, was called to the Bar,

I’d an appetite fresh and hearty,

But I was, as many young barristers are,

An impecunious party.

I’d a swallow-tail coat of a beautiful blue—

A brief which was brought by a booby—

A couple of shirts and a collar or two,

And a ring that looked like a ruby!

In Westminster Hall I danced a dance,

Like a semi-despondent fury;

For I thought I should never hit on a chance

Of addressing a British Jury—

But I soon got tired of third-class journeys,

And dinners of bread and water;

So I fell in love with a rich attorney’s

Elderly, ugly daughter.

The rich attorney, he wiped his eyes,

And replied to my fond professions:

“You shall reap the reward of your enterprise,

At the Bailey and Middlesex Sessions.

You’ll soon get used to her looks,” said he,

“And a very nice girl you’ll find
her—

She may very well pass for forty-three

In the dusk, with a light behind her!”

The rich attorney was as good as his word:

The briefs came trooping gaily,

And every day my voice was heard

At the Sessions or Ancient Bailey.

All thieves who could my fees afford

Relied on my orations,

And many a burglar I’ve restored

To his friends and his relations.

At length I became as rich as the
Gurneys
—

An incubus then I thought her,

So I threw over that rich attorney’s

Elderly, ugly daughter.

The rich attorney my character high

Tried vainly to disparage—

And now, if you please, I’m ready to try

This Breach of Promise of Marriage!

WHEN
I FIRST PUT THIS UNIFORM ON

When
I first put
this uniform on,

I said, as I looked in the glass,

“It’s one to a
million

That any civilian

My figure and form will surpass.

Gold lace has a charm for the fair,

And I’ve plenty of that, and to spare,

While a lover’s
professions,

When uttered in Hessians,

Are eloquent everywhere!”

A fact that I
counted upon,

When I first put
this uniform on!

I said, when I first put it on,

“It is plain to the veriest dunce

That every beauty

Will feel it her duty

To yield to its glamour at once.

They will see that I’m freely gold-laced

In a uniform handsome and chaste”—

But the peripatetics

Of long-haired æsthetics,

Are very much more to their taste—

Which I never
counted upon

When I first put
this uniform on!

SOLATIUM

Comes
the broken
flower—

Comes the cheated maid—

Though the tempest lower,

Rain and cloud will fade!

Take, O maid, these posies:

Though thy beauty rare

Shame the blushing roses,

They are passing fair!

Wear the flowers
till they fade;

Happy be thy
life, O maid!

O’er the season vernal,

Time may cast a shade;

Sunshine, if eternal,

Makes the roses fade:

Time may do his duty;

Let the thief alone—

Winter hath a beauty

That is all his own.

Fairest days are
sun and shade:

Happy be thy
life, O maid!

p. 335
A
NIGHTMARE

When
you’re
lying awake with a dismal headache, and repose is taboo’d
by anxiety,

I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in
without impropriety;

For your brain is on fire—the bedclothes conspire of usual
slumber to plunder you:

First your counterpane goes and uncovers your toes, and your
sheet slips demurely from under you;

Then the blanketing tickles—you feel like mixed pickles, so
terribly sharp is the pricking,

And you’re hot, and you’re cross, and you tumble and
toss till there’s nothing ’twixt you and the
ticking.

Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap, and you
pick ’em all up in a tangle;

Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its
usual angle!

Well, you get some repose in the form of a doze, with hot
eyeballs and head ever aching,

But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that
you’d very much better be waking;

For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in
a steamer from Harwich,

Which is something between a large bathing-machine and a very
small second-class carriage;

And you’re giving a treat (penny ice and cold meat) to a
party of friends and relations—

They’re a ravenous horde—and they all came on board
at Sloane Square and South Kensington Stations.

And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started
that morning from Devon);

He’s a bit undersized, and you don’t feel surprised
when he tells you he’s only eleven.

Well, you’re driving like mad with this singular lad (by
the bye the ship’s now a four-wheeler),

And you’re playing round games, and he calls you bad names
when you tell him that “ties pay the dealer”;

But this you can’t stand, so you throw up your hand, and
you find you’re as cold as an icicle,

In your shirt and your socks (the black silk with gold clocks),
crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:

And he and the crew are on bicycles too—which they’ve
somehow or other invested in—

And he’s telling the tars all the particu
lars
of a
company he’s interested in—

It’s a scheme of devices, to get at low prices, all goods
from cough mixtures to cables

(Which tickled the sailors) by treating retailers, as though they
were all vege
ta
bles—

You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman (first take
off his boots with a boot-tree),

And his legs will take root, and his fingers will shoot, and
they’ll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree—

From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea,
cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries,

While the pastry-cook plant cherry-brandy will grant—apple
puffs, and three-corners, and banberries—

The shares are a penny, and ever so many are taken by
Rothschild
and
Baring
,

And just as a few are allotted to you, you awake with a shudder
despairing—

You’re a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no
wonder you snore, for your head’s on the floor, and
you’ve needles and pins from your soles to your shins, and
your flesh is a-creep, for your left leg’s asleep, and
you’ve cramp in your toes, and a fly on your nose, and some
fluff in your lung, and a feverish tongue, and a thirst
that’s intense, and a general sense that you haven’t
been sleeping in clover;

But the darkness has passed, and it’s daylight at last, and
the night has been long—ditto, ditto my song—and
thank goodness they’re both of them over!

DON’T FORGET!

Now
, Marco, dear,

My wishes hear:

While you’re away

It’s understood

You will be good,

And not too gay.

To every trace

Of maiden grace

You will be blind,

And will not glance

By any chance

On womankind!

If you are wise,

You’ll shut your eyes

Till we arrive,

And not address

A lady less

Than forty-five;

You’ll please to frown

On every gown

That you may see;

And O, my pet,

You won’t forget

You’ve married me!

O, my darling, O, my pet,

Whatever else you may forget,

In yonder isle beyond the sea,

O, don’t forget you’ve married me!

You’ll lay your head

Upon your bed

At set of sun.

You will not sing

Of anything

To any one:

You’ll sit and mope

All day, I hope,

And shed a tear

Upon the life

Your little wife

Is passing here!

And if so be

You think of me,

Please tell the moon;

I’ll read it all

In rays that fall

On the lagoon:

You’ll be so kind

As tell the wind

How you may be,

And send me words

By little birds

To comfort me!

And O, my darling, O, my pet,

Whatever else you may forget,

In yonder isle beyond the sea,

O, don’t forget you’ve married me!

THE
SUICIDE’S GRAVE

On
a tree by a river
a little tomtit

Sang
“Willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

And I said to him, “Dicky-bird, why do you sit

Singing
‘Willow, titwillow, titwillow’?

Is it weakness of intellect, birdie?” I cried,

“Or a rather tough worm in your little inside?”

With a shake of his poor little head he replied,

“Oh,
willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

He slapped at his chest, as he sat on that
bough,

Singing
“Willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

And a cold perspiration bespangled his brow,

Oh, willow,
titwillow, titwillow!

He sobbed and he sighed, and a gurgle he gave,

Then he threw himself into the billowy wave,

And an echo arose from the suicide’s grave—

“Oh,
willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

Now I feel just as sure as I’m sure that
my name

Isn’t
Willow, titwillow, titwillow,

That ’twas blighted affection that made him exclaim,

“Oh,
willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

And if you remain callous and obdurate, I

Shall perish as he did, and you will know why,

Though I probably shall not exclaim as I die,

“Oh,
willow, titwillow, titwillow!”

HE
AND SHE

He

youth who loves a little maid—

(Hey, but his
face is a sight for to see!)

Silent is he, for he’s
modest and afraid—

(Hey, but
he’s timid as a youth can be!)

She
.  I know a maid who loves a
gallant youth—

(Hey, but she
sickens as the days go by!)

She
cannot tell him all the
sad, sad truth—

(Hey, but I
think that little maid will die!)

Both
.  Now tell me pray, and tell
me true,

What in the world should the poor soul do?

He
.  He cannot
eat and he cannot sleep—

(Hey, but his
face is a sight for to see!)

Daily he goes for to
wail—for to weep—

(Hey, but
he’s wretched as a youth can be!)

She
.  She’s very thin and
she’s very pale—

(Hey, but she
sickens as the days go by!)

Daily she goes for to
weep—for to wail—

(Hey, but I
think that little maid will die!)

Both
.  Now tell me pray, and tell
me true,

What in the world should the poor soul do?

She
.  If I were
the youth I should offer her my name—

(Hey, but her
face is a sight for to see!)

He
.  If I were the maid I should fan
his honest flame—

(Hey, but
he’s bashful as a youth can be!)

She
.  If I were the youth I
should speak to her to-day—

(Hey, but she
sickens as the days go by!)

He
.  If I were the maid I should meet
the lad half way—

(For I really do
believe that timid youth will die!)

Both
.  I thank you much for your
counsel true;

I’ve learnt what that poor soul ought to do!

And dead and buried be the curst

Oh weak Might Be!

Oh May, Might, Could, Would, Should!

How powerless ye

A
MIRAGE

Were
I thy bride,

Then the whole world beside

Were not too wide

To hold my wealth of love—

Were I thy bride!

Upon thy breast

My loving head would rest,

As on her nest

The tender turtle-dove—

Were I thy bride!

This heart
of mine

Would be one heart with thine,

And in that shrine

Our happiness would dwell—

Were I thy bride!

And all day long

Our lives should be a song:

No grief, no wrong

Should make my heart rebel—

Were I thy bride!

The silvery
flute,

The melancholy lute,

Were night-owl’s hoot

To my low-whispered coo—

Were I thy bride!

The skylark’s trill

Were but discordance shrill

To the soft thrill

Of wooing as I’d woo—

Were I thy bride!

The
rose’s sigh

Were as a carrion’s cry

To lullaby

Such as I’d sing to thee—

Were I thy bride!

A feather’s press

Were leaden heaviness

To my caress.

But then, unhappily,

I’m not thy bride!

THE
GHOSTS’ HIGH NOON

When
the night wind
howls in the chimney cowls, and the bat in the moonlight
flies,

And inky clouds, like funeral shrouds, sail over the midnight
skies—

When the footpads quail at the night-bird’s wail, and black
dogs bay the moon,

Then is the spectres’ holiday—then is the
ghosts’ high noon!

As the sob of the breeze sweeps over the trees,
and the mists lie low on the fen,

From grey tombstones are gathered the bones that once were women
and men,

And away they go, with a mop and a mow, to the revel that ends
too soon,

For cockcrow limits our holiday—the dead of the
night’s high noon!

And then each ghost with his ladye-toast to
their churchyard beds take flight,

With a kiss, perhaps, on her lantern chaps, and a grisly grim
“good night”;

Till the welcome knell of the midnight bell rings forth its
jolliest tune,

And ushers our next high holiday—the dead of the
night’s high noon!

THE
HUMANE MIKADO

A
more
humane Mikado
never

Did in Japan exist;

To nobody second,

I’m certainly reckoned

A true philanthropist.

It is my very humane endeavour

To make, to some extent,

Each evil liver

A running river

Of harmless merriment.

My object all sublime

I shall achieve in time—

To let the punishment fit the crime—

The punishment fit the crime;

And make each prisoner pent

Unwillingly represent

A source of innocent merriment—

Of innocent
merriment!

All prosy dull society sinners,

Who chatter and bleat and bore,

Are sent to hear sermons

From mystical Germans

Who preach from ten to four:

The amateur tenor, whose vocal villainies

All desire to shirk,

Shall, during off-hours,

Exhibit his powers

To Madame Tussaud’s waxwork:

The lady who dyes a chemical yellow,

Or stains her grey hair puce,

Or pinches her figger,

Is blacked like a nigger

With permanent walnut juice:

The idiot who, in railway carriages,

Scribbles on window panes,

We only suffer

To ride on a buffer

In Parliamentary trains.

My object all sublime

I shall achieve in time—

To let the punishment fit the crime—

The punishment
fit the crime;

And make each prisoner pent

Unwillingly represent

A source of innocent merriment—

Of innocent merriment!

The advertising quack who wearies

With tales of countless cures,

His teeth, I’ve enacted,

Shall all be extracted

By terrified amateurs:

The music-hall singer attends a series

Of masses and fugues and “ops”

By Bach, interwoven

With Spohr and Beethoven,

At classical Monday Pops:

The billiard sharp whom any one catches

His doom’s extremely hard—

He’s made to dwell

In a dungeon cell

On a spot that’s always barred;

And there he plays extravagant matches

In fitless finger-stalls,

On a cloth untrue

With a twisted cue,

And elliptical billiard balls!

My object all sublime

I shall achieve in time—

To let the punishment fit the crime—

The punishment fit the crime;

And make each prisoner pent

Unwillingly represent

A source of innocent merriment,

Of innocent merriment!

Now
, Jurymen, hear
my advice—

All kinds of vulgar prejudice

I pray you set aside:

With stern judicial frame of mind—

From bias free of every kind,

This trial must be tried!

Oh, listen to the plaintiff’s case:

Observe the features of her face—

The broken-hearted bride!

Condole with her distress of mind—

From bias free of every kind,

This trial must be tried!

And when amid the plaintiff’s shrieks,

The ruffianly defendant speaks—

Upon the other side;

What
he
may say you need not mind—

From bias free of every kind,

This trial must be tried!

THE
GREAT OAK TREE

There
grew a little flower

’Neath a great oak tree:

When the tempest ’gan to lower

Little heeded she:

No need had she to cower,

For she dreaded not its power—

She was happy in the bower

Of her great oak tree!

Sing hey,

Lackaday!

Let the tears fall free

For the pretty little flower and the great oak tree!

When she found that he was
fickle,

Was that great oak tree,

She was in a pretty pickle,

As she well might be—

But his gallantries were mickle,

For Death followed with his sickle,

And her tears began to trickle

For her great oak tree!

Sing hey,

Lackaday!

Let the tears fall free

For the pretty little flower and the great oak tree!

Said she, “He loved me
never,

Did that great oak tree,

But I’m neither rich nor clever,

And so why should he?

But though fate our fortunes sever,

To be constant I’ll endeavour,

Ay, for ever and for ever,

To my great oak tree!”

Sing hey,

Lackaday!

Let the tears fall free

For the pretty little flower and the great oak tree!

KING
GOODHEART

There
lived a King,
as I’ve been told

In the wonder-working days of old,

When hearts were twice as good as
gold,

And twenty times as mellow.

Good temper triumphed in his face,

And in his heart he found a
place

For all the erring human race

And every wretched fellow.

When he had Rhenish wine to
drink

It made him very sad to think

That some, at junket or at jink,

Must be content with toddy:

He wished all men as rich as he

(And he was rich as rich could be),

So to the top of every tree

Promoted everybody.

Ambassadors cropped up like hay,

Prime Ministers and such as they

Grew like asparagus in May,

And Dukes were three a penny:

Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats,

And Bishops in their shovel
hats

Were plentiful as tabby cats—

If possible, too many.

On every side Field-Marshals
gleamed,

Small beer were Lords-Lieutenants deemed,

With Admirals the ocean teemed,

All round his wide dominions;

And Party Leaders you might meet

In twos and threes in every street

Maintaining, with no little heat,

Their various opinions.

That King, although no one denies,

His heart was of abnormal size,

Yet he’d have acted
otherwise

If he had been acuter.

The end is easily foretold,

When every blessed thing you
hold

Is made of silver, or of gold,

You long for simple pewter.

When you have nothing else to
wear

But cloth of gold and satins rare,

For cloth of gold you cease to care—

Up goes the price of shoddy:

In short, whoever you may be,

To this conclusion you’ll agree,

When every one is somebody,

Then no one’s anybody!

SLEEP ON!

Fear
no unlicensed
entry,

Heed no bombastic talk,

While guards the British Sentry

Pall Mall and Birdcage Walk.

Let European thunders

Occasion no alarms,

Though diplomatic blunders

May cause a cry “To arms!”

Sleep on, ye
pale civilians;

All thunder-clouds defy:

On
Europe’s countless millions

The Sentry keeps his eye!

Should foreign-born rapscallions

In London dare to show

Their overgrown battalions,

Be sure I’ll let you know.

Should Russians or Norwegians

Pollute our favoured clime

With rough barbaric legions,

I’ll mention it in time.

So sleep in
peace, civilians,

The Continent defy;

While on its
countless millions

The Sentry keeps his eye!

THE
LOVE-SICK BOY

When
first my old,
old love I knew,

My bosom welled with joy;

My riches at her feet I threw;

I was a love-sick boy!

No terms seemed too extravagant

Upon her to employ—

I used to mope, and sigh, and pant,

Just like a love-sick boy!

But joy incessant palls the sense;

And love unchanged will cloy,

And she became a bore intense

Unto her love-sick boy?

With fitful glimmer burnt my flame,

And I grew cold and coy,

At last, one morning, I became

Another’s love-sick boy!

POETRY EVERYWHERE

What
time the poet
hath hymned

The writhing maid, lithe-limbed,

Quivering on amaranthine asphodel,

How can he paint her woes,

Knowing, as well he knows,

That all can be set right with calomel?

When from the poet’s plinth

The amorous colocynth

Yearns for the aloe, faint with rapturous
thrills,

How can he hymn their throes

Knowing, as well he knows,

That they are only uncompounded pills?

Is it, and can it be,

Nature hath this decree,

Nothing poetic in the world shall dwell?

Or that in all her works

Something poetic lurks,

Even in colocynth and calomel?

p. 453
HE
LOVES!

He
loves!  If
in the bygone years

Thine eyes have ever shed

Tears—bitter, unavailing tears,

For one untimely dead—

If in the eventide of life

Sad thoughts of her arise,

Then let the memory of thy wife

Plead for my boy—he dies!

He dies!  If fondly laid aside

In some old cabinet,

Memorials of thy long-dead bride

Lie, dearly treasured yet,

Then let her hallowed bridal dress—

Her little dainty gloves—

Her withered flowers—her faded tress—

Plead for my boy—he loves!

p. 458
TRUE
DIFFIDENCE

My
boy, you may take
it from me,

That of all the afflictions
accurst

With which a man’s saddled

And hampered and addled,

A diffident nature’s the
worst.

Though clever as clever can be—

A Crichton of early
romance—

You must stir it and stump it,

And blow your own trumpet,

Or, trust me, you haven’t a
chance.

Now take, for example,
my
case:

I’ve a bright intellectual
brain—

In all London city

There’s no one so witty—

I’ve thought so again and
again.

I’ve a highly intelligent face—

My features cannot be
denied—

But, whatever I try, sir,

I fail in—and why, sir?

I’m modesty personified!

As a poet, I’m tender and
quaint—

I’ve passion and fervour and
grace—

From Ovid and Horace

To Swinburne and Morris,

They all of them take a back
place.

Then I sing and I play and I paint;

Though none are accomplished as
I,

To say so were treason:

You ask me the reason?

I’m diffident, modest, and
shy!

p. 466
THE
TANGLED SKEIN

Try
we life-long, we
can never

Straighten out life’s tangled skein,

Why should we, in vain endeavour,

Guess and guess and guess again?

Life’s a pudding full of plums

Care’s a canker that benumbs.

Wherefore waste our elocution

On impossible solution?

Life’s a pleasant institution,

Let us take it as it comes!

Set aside the dull enigma,

We shall guess it all too soon;

Failure brings no kind of stigma—

Dance we to another tune!

String the lyre and fill the cup,

Lest on sorrow we should sup;

Hop and skip to Fancy’s fiddle,

Hands across and down the middle—

Life’s perhaps the only riddle

That we shrink from giving up!

p. 471
MY
LADY

Bedecked
in fashion
trim,

With every curl a-quiver;

Or leaping, light of limb,

O’er rivulet and river;

Or skipping o’er the lea

On daffodil and daisy;

Or stretched beneath a tree,

All languishing and lazy;

Whatever be her mood—

Be she demurely prude

Or languishingly lazy—

My lady drives me crazy!

In vain her heart is wooed,

Whatever be her mood!

What profit should I gain

Suppose she loved me dearly?

Her coldness turns my brain

To
verge
of madness
merely.

Her kiss—though, Heaven knows,

To dream of it were
treason—

Would tend, as I suppose,

To utter loss of reason!

My state is not amiss;

I would not have a kiss

Which, in or out of season,

Might tend to loss of reason:

What profit in such bliss?

A fig for such a kiss!

p. 473
ONE
AGAINST THE WORLD

It’s
my
opinion—though I own

In thinking so I’m quite alone—

In some respects I’m but a
fright.

You
like my features, I suppose?

I’m
disappointed with my nose:

Some rave about it—perhaps
they’re right.

My figure just sets off a fit;

But when they say it’s exquisite

(And they
do
say so),
that’s too strong.

I hope I’m not what people call

Opinionated!  After all,

I’m but a goose, and may be
wrong!

When charms enthral

There’s some excuse

For measures strong;

And after all

I’m but a goose,

And may be wrong!

My teeth are very neat, no doubt;

But after all they
may
fall out:

I
think they
will—some think they won’t.

My hands are small, as you may see,

But not as small as they might be,

At least,
I
think
so—others don’t.

But there, a girl may preach and prate

From morning six to evening eight,

And never stop to dine,

When all the world, although misled,

Is quite agreed on any head—

And it is quite agreed on
mine!

All said and done,

It’s little I

Against a throng.

I’m only one,

And possibly

I may be wrong!

PUT
A PENNY IN THE SLOT

If
my action’s
stiff and crude,

Do not laugh, because it’s rude.

If my gestures promise larks,

Do not make unkind remarks.

Clockwork figures may be found

Everywhere and all around.

Ten to one, if I but knew,

You are clockwork figures too.

And the motto of the lot,

“Put a penny in the slot!”

Usurer, for money lent,

Making out his cent per cent—

Widow plump or maiden rare,

Deaf and dumb to suitor’s prayer—

Tax collectors, whom in vain

You implore to “call again”—

Cautious voter, whom you find

Slow in making up his mind—

If you’d move them on the spot,

Put a penny in the slot!

Bland reporters in the courts,

Who suppress police reports—

Sheriff’s yeoman, pen in fist,

Making out a jury list—

Stern policemen, tall and spare,

Acting all “upon the square”—

(Which in words that plainer fall,

Means that you can square them all)—

If you want to move the lot,

Put a penny in the slot!

p. 482
GOOD
LITTLE GIRLS

Although
of native
maids the cream,

We’re brought up on the English scheme—

The best of all

For great and small

Who modesty adore.

For English girls are good as gold,

Extremely modest (so we’re told),

Demurely coy—divinely cold—

And we are that—and more.

To please papa, who argues thus—

All girls should mould themselves on us,

Because we are,

By furlongs far,

The best of all the bunch;

We show ourselves to loud applause

From ten to four without a pause—

Which is an awkward time because

It cuts into our lunch.

Oh, maids of high and low degree,

Whose social code is rather free,

Please look at us and you will see

What good young ladies ought to be!

And as we stand, like clockwork toys,

A lecturer papa employs

To puff and praise

Our modest ways

And guileless character—

Our well-known blush—our downcast eyes—

Our famous look of mild surprise

(Which competition still defies)—

Our celebrated “Sir!!!”

Then all the crowd take down our looks

In pocket memorandum books.

To diagnose,

Our modest pose

The kodaks do their best:

If evidence you would possess

Of what is maiden bashfulness,

You only need a button press—

And
we
do all the rest.

LIFE

First
you’re
born—and I’ll be bound you

Find a dozen strangers round you.

“Hallo,” cries the new-born baby,

“Where’s my parents? which may they be?”

Awkward silence—no
reply—

Puzzled baby wonders why!

Father rises, bows politely—

Mother smiles (but not too brightly)—

Doctor mumbles like a dumb thing—

Nurse is busy mixing something.—

Every symptom tends to show

You’re decidedly
de
trop
—

Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! he! ho! ho!

Time’s teetotum,

If you spin it,

Give its quotum

Once a minute:

I’ll go bail

You hit the nail,

And if you fail

The deuce is in it!

You grow up, and you discover

What it is to be a lover.

Some young lady is selected—

Poor, perhaps, but well-connected,

Whom you hail (for Love is
blind)

As the Queen of Fairy-kind.

Though she’s plain—perhaps unsightly,

Makes her face up—laces tightly,

In her form your fancy traces

All the gifts of all the graces.

Rivals none the maiden woo,

So you take her and she takes
you!

Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!

Joke beginning,

Never ceases,

Till your inning

Time releases;

On your way

You blindly stray,

And day by day

The joke increases!

Ten years later—Time progresses—

Sours your temper—thins your tresses;

Fancy, then, her chain relaxes;

Rates are facts and so are taxes.

Fairy Queen’s no longer
young—

Fairy Queen has such a tongue!

Twins have probably intruded—

Quite unbidden—just as you did;

They’re a source of care and trouble—

Just as you were—only double.

Comes at last the final
stroke—

Time has had his little joke!

Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!

Daily driven

(Wife as drover)

Ill you’ve thriven—

Ne’er in clover:

Lastly, when

Threescore and ten

(And not till then),

The joke is over!

Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!

Then—and then

The joke is over!

LIMITED LIABILITY

Some
seven men form
an Association

(If possible, all Peers and
Baronets),

They start off with a public declaration

To what extent they mean to pay
their debts.

That’s called their Capital: if they are wary

They will not quote it at a sum
immense.

The figure’s immaterial—it may vary

From eighteen million down to
eighteenpence.

I
should put it rather low;

The good sense of doing so

Will be evident at once to any
debtor.

When it’s left to you to say

What amount you mean to pay,

Why, the lower you can put it at,
the better.

They then proceed to trade with all
who’ll trust ’em,

Quite irrespective of their
capital

(It’s shady, but it’s sanctified by custom);

Bank, Railway, Loan, or Panama
Canal.

You can’t embark on trading too tremendous—

It’s strictly fair, and
based on common sense—

If you succeed, your profits are stupendous—

And if you fail, pop goes your
eighteenpence.

Make the money-spinner spin!

For you only stand to win,

And you’ll never with
dishonesty be twitted.

For nobody can know,

To a million or so,

To what extent your
capital’s committed!

If you come to grief, and creditors are
craving

(For nothing that is planned by
mortal head

Is certain in this Vale of Sorrow—saving

That one’s Liability is
Limited),—

Do you suppose that signifies perdition?

If so you’re but a monetary
dunce—

You merely file a Winding-Up Petition,

And start another Company at
once!

Though a Rothschild you may be

In your own capacity,

As a Company you’ve come to
utter sorrow—

But the Liquidators say,

“Never mind—you needn’t pay,”

So you start another Company
to-morrow!

ANGLICISED UTOPIA

Society
has quite
forsaken all her wicked courses,

Which empties our police courts, and abolishes divorces.

(Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.)

No tolerance we show to undeserving rank and splendour;

For the higher his position is, the greater the offender.

(That’s a maxim that is prevalent in England.)

No Peeress at our Drawing-Room before the Presence passes

Who wouldn’t be accepted by the lower-middle classes;

Each shady dame, whatever be her rank, is bowed out neatly.

In short, this happy country has been Anglicised completely!

It really is
surprising

What a thorough
Anglicising

We’ve brought
about—Utopia’s quite another land;

In her
enterprising movements,

She is
England—with improvements,

Which we dutifully offer to our
mother-land!

Our city we have beautified—we’ve
done it willy-nilly—

And all that isn’t Belgrave Square is Strand and
Piccadilly.

(They haven’t any slummeries in England.)

We have solved the labour question with discrimination
polished,

So poverty is obsolete and hunger is abolished—

(They are going to abolish it in England.)

The Chamberlain our native stage has purged, beyond a
question,

Of “risky” situation and indelicate suggestion;

No piece is tolerated if it’s costumed
indiscreetly—

In short, this happy country has been Anglicised completely!

It really is
surprising

What a thorough
Anglicising

We’ve brought
about—Utopia’s quite another land;

In her
enterprising movements,

She is
England—with improvements,

Which we dutifully offer to our
mother-land!

Our Peerage we’ve remodelled on an
intellectual basis,

Which certainly is rough on our hereditary races—

(They are going to remodel it in England.)

The Brewers and the Cotton Lords no longer seek admission,

And Literary Merit meets with proper recognition—

(As Literary Merit does in England!)

Who knows but we may count among our intellectual chickens

Like them an Earl of Thackeray and p’raps a Duke of
Dickens—

Lord Fildes and Viscount Millais (when they come) we’ll
welcome sweetly—

And then, this happy country will be Anglicised completely!

It really is
surprising

What a thorough
Anglicising

We’ve brought
about—Utopia’s quite another land;

In her
enterprising movements,

She is
England—with improvements,

Which we dutifully offer to our
mother-land!

AN
ENGLISH GIRL

A
wonderful
joy our eyes to bless,

In her magnificent comeliness,

Is an English girl of eleven stone two,

And five foot ten in her dancing shoe!

She follows the hounds, and on she pounds—

The “field” tails off and the muffs
diminish—

Over the hedges and brooks she bounds—

Straight as a crow, from find to finish.

At cricket, her kin will lose or win—

She and her maids, on grass and clover,

Eleven maids out—eleven maids in—

(And perhaps an occasional “maiden over”).

Go search the world and search the sea,

Then come you home and sing with me

There’s no such gold and no such pearl

As a bright and beautiful English girl!

With a ten-mile spin she
stretches her limbs,

She golfs, she punts, she rows, she swims—

She plays, she sings, she dances, too,

From ten or eleven till all is blue!

At ball or drum, till small hours come

(Chaperon’s fan conceals her yawning),

She’ll waltz away like a teetotum,

And never go home till daylight’s dawning.

Lawn tennis may share her favours fair—

Her eyes a-dance and her cheeks a-glowing—

Down comes her hair, but what does she care?

It’s all her own and it’s worth the showing!

Go search the world and search the sea,

Then come you home and sing with me

There’s no such gold and no such pearl

As a bright and beautiful English girl!

Her soul is sweet as the
ocean air,

For prudery knows no haven there;

To find mock-modesty, please apply

To the conscious blush and the downcast eye.

Rich in the things contentment brings,

In every pure enjoyment wealthy,

Blithe as a beautiful bird she sings,

For body and mind are hale and healthy.

Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill—

Her heart is light as a floating feather—

As pure and bright as the mountain rill

That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather!

Go search the world and search the sea,

Then come you home and sing with me

There’s no such gold and no such pearl

As a bright and beautiful English girl!

A
MANAGER’S PERPLEXITIES

Were
I a king in very truth,

And had a son—a guileless
youth—

In probable succession;

To teach him patience, teach him
tact,

How promptly in a fix to act,

He should adopt, in point of
fact,

A manager’s profession.

To that condition he should
stoop

(Despite a too fond mother),

With eight or ten
“stars” in his troupe,

All jealous of each other!

Oh, the man who can rule a theatrical crew,

Each member a genius (and some of them two),

And manage to humour them, little and great,

Can govern a tuppenny-ha’penny State!

Both A and
B rehearsal slight—

They say they’ll be
“all right at night”

(They’ve both to go to school yet);

C in each act
must
change
her dress,

D
will
attempt to
“square the press”;

E won’t play Romeo unless

His grandmother plays Juliet;

F claims all hoydens as her
rights

(She’s played them thirty seasons);

And G must show herself in
tights

For two convincing reasons—

Two very well-shaped reasons!

Oh, the man who can drive a theatrical team,

With wheelers and leaders in order supreme,

Can govern and rule, with a wave of his fin,

All Europe and Asia—with Ireland thrown in!

OUT
OF SORTS

When
you find
you’re a broken-down critter,

Who is all of a trimmle and twitter,

With your palate unpleasantly bitter,

As if you’d just bitten a
pill—

When your legs are as thin as dividers,

And you’re plagued with unruly insiders,

And your spine is all creepy with spiders,

And you’re highly gamboge in
the gill—

When you’ve got a beehive in your head,

And a sewing machine in each
ear,

And you feel that you’ve eaten your bed,

And you’ve got a bad
headache
down here
—

When such facts are about,

And these symptoms you find

In your body or crown—

Well, it’s time to look out,

You may make up your mind

You had better lie down!

When your lips are all smeary—like
tallow,

And your tongue is decidedly yallow,

With a pint of warm oil in your sw
a
llow,

And a pound of tin-tacks in your
chest—

When you’re down in the mouth with the vapours,

And all over your new Morris papers

Black-beetles are cutting their capers,

And crawly things never at
rest—

When you doubt if your head is your own,

And you jump when an open door
slams—

Then you’ve got to a state which is known

To the medical world as
“jim-jams.”

If such symptoms you find

In your body or head,

They’re not easy to quell—

You may make up your mind

You are better in bed,

For you’re not at all well!

HOW
IT’S DONE

Bold-faced
ranger

(Perfect stranger)

Meets two well-behaved young ladies

He’s attractive,

Young and active—

Each a little bit afraid is.

Youth advances,

At his glances

To their danger they awaken;

They repel him

As they tell him

He is very much mistaken.

Though they speak to him politely,

Please observe they’re sneering slightly,

Just to show he’s acting vainly.

This is Virtue saying plainly,

“Go away, young bachelor,

We are not what you take us
for!”

(When addressed impertinently,

English ladies answer gently,

“Go away, young bachelor,

We are not what you take us
for!”)

As he
gazes,

Hat he raises,

Enters into conversation.

Makes excuses—

This produces

Interesting agitation.

He, with daring,

Undespairing,

Gives his card—his rank discloses—

Little heeding

This proceeding,

They turn up their little noses.

Pray observe this lesson vital—

When a man of rank and title

His position first discloses,

Always cock your little noses.

When at home, let all the class

Try this in the looking-glass.

(English girls of well-bred notions

Shun all unrehearsed emotions,

English girls of highest class

Practise them before the
glass.)

His
intentions

Then he mentions,

Something definite to go on—

Makes recitals

Of his titles,

Hints at settlements, and so on.

Smiling sweetly,

They, discreetly,

Ask for further evidences:

Thus invited,

He, delighted,

Gives the usual references.

This is business.  Each is fluttered

When the offer’s fairly uttered.

“Which of them has his affection?”

He declines to make selection.

Do they quarrel for his dross?

Not a bit of it—they
toss!

Please observe this cogent moral—

English ladies never quarrel.

When a doubt they come across,

English ladies always toss.

p. 515
A
CLASSICAL REVIVAL

At
the outset I may
mention it’s my sovereign intention

To revive the classic memories of Athens at its
best,

For my company possesses all the necessary dresses,

And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with
the rest.

We’ve a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)

Who respond to the
choreutae
of that
cultivated age,

And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster,

Would accept as the
choregus
of the early
Attic stage.

This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,

Which are always calculated by the day or by the
week—

And I’ll pay ’em (if they’ll back me) all in

oboloi
and
drachmae
,

Which they’ll get (if they prefer it) at the
Kalends that are Greek!

(At this juncture I may
mention

That this erudition sham

Is but classical pretension,

The result of steady
“cram.”:

Periphrastic methods spurning,

To my readers all discerning

I admit this show of learning

Is the fruit of steady
“cram.”!)

In the period Socratic every dining-room was
Attic

(Which suggests an architecture of a topsy-turvy
kind),

There they’d satisfy their twist on a

recherché
cold

ἄριστον
,

Which is what they called their lunch—and so
may you, if you’re inclined.

As they gradually got on, they’d

πρέπεσθαι
πρὸς τὸν
πότον

(Which is Attic for a steady and a conscientious
drink).

But they mixed their wine with water—which I’m sure
they didn’t oughter—

And we Anglo-Saxons know a trick worth two of that,
I think!

Then came rather risky dances (under certain circumstances)

Which would shock that worthy gentleman, the
Licenser of Plays,

Corybantian mani
ac
kick—Dionysiac or
Bacchic—

And the Dithyrambic revels of those indecorous
days.

(And perhaps I’d better
mention

Lest alarming you I am,

That it isn’t our intention

To perform a Dithyramb—

It displays a lot of stocking,

Which is always very shocking,

And of course I’m only mocking

At the prevalence of
“cram.”)

Yes, on reconsideration, there are customs of
that nation

Which are not in strict accordance with the habits
of our day,

And when I come to codify, their rules I mean to modify,

Or Mrs. Grundy, p’r’aps, may have a word
or two to say:

For they hadn’t macintoshes or umbrellas or
goloshes—

And a shower with their dresses must have played the
very deuce,

And it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of
sneezing,

For, it seems, of pocket-handkerchiefs they
didn’t know the use.

They wore little underclothing—scarcely anything—or
no-thing—

And their dress of Coan silk was quite transparent
in design—

Well, in fact, in summer weather, something like the
“altogether.”

And it’s
there
, I rather fancy, I shall
have to draw the line!

(And again I wish to
mention

That this erudition sham

Is but classical pretension,

The result of steady
“cram.”

Yet my classic love aggressive,

If you’ll pardon the possessive,

Is exceedingly impressive

When you’re passing an
exam.)

THE
PRACTICAL JOKER

Oh
what a fund of
joy jocund lies hid in harmless hoaxes!

What keen
enjoyment springs

From cheap and
simple things!

What deep delight from sources trite inventive humour coaxes,

That pain and
trouble brew

For every one
but you!

Gunpowder placed inside its waist improves a mild Havanah,

Its unexpected
flash

Burns eyebrows
and moustache;

When people dine no kind of wine beats ipecacuanha,

But common sense
suggests

You keep it for
your guests—

Then naught annoys the organ boys like throwing red-hot
coppers,

And much
amusement bides

In common
butter-slides.

And stringy snares across the stairs cause unexpected
croppers.

Coal scuttles,
recollect,

Produce the same
effect.

A man possessed

Of common sense

Need not invest

At great expense—

It does not call

For pocket deep,

These jokes are all

Extremely cheap.

If you commence with eighteenpence (it’s all you’ll
have to pay),

You may command a pleasant and a most instructive day.

A good spring gun breeds endless fun, and makes
men jump like rockets,

And turnip-heads
on posts

Make very decent
ghosts:

Then hornets sting like anything, when placed in waist-coat
pockets—

Burnt cork and
walnut juice

Are not without
their use.

No fun compares with easy chairs whose seats are stuffed with
needles—

Live shrimps their patience tax

When put down people’s backs—

Surprising, too, what one can do with fifty fat black
beedles—

And treacle on a
chair

Will make a
Quaker swear!

Then sharp tin tacks

And pocket squirts—

And cobblers’ wax

For ladies’ skirts—

And slimy slugs

On bedroom floors—

And water jugs

On open doors—

Prepared with these cheap properties, amusing tricks to play,

Upon a friend a man may spend a most delightful day!

p. 526
THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM

A
monarch
is
pestered with cares,

Though, no doubt, he can often
trepan them;

But one comes in a shape he can never escape—

The implacable National Anthem!

Though for quiet and rest he may yearn,

It pursues him at every turn—

No chance of forsaking

Its
rococo
numbers;

They haunt him when waking—

They poison his slumbers—

Like the Banbury Lady, whom every one knows,

He’s cursed with its music wherever he goes!

Though its words but imperfectly
rhyme,

And the devil himself couldn’t scan them;

With composure polite he endures
day and night

That illiterate National Anthem!

It serves a good purpose, I own:

Its strains are devout and
impressive—

Its heart-stirring notes raise a lump in our throats

As we burn with devotion
excessive:

But the King, who’s been bored by that song

From his cradle—each day—all day long—

Who’s heard it loud-shouted

By throats operatic,

And loyally spouted

By courtiers emphatic—

By soldier—by sailor—by drum and by fife—

Small blame if he thinks it the plague of his life!

While his subjects sing loudly and
long,

Their King—who would willingly ban them—

Sits, worry disguising,
anathematising

That Bogie, the National Anthem!

p. 534
HER
TERMS

My
wedded life

Must every pleasure bring

On scale extensive!

If I’m your wife

I must have everything

That’s most expensive—

A lady’s-maid—

(My hair alone to do

I am not able)—

And I’m afraid

I’ve been accustomed to

A first-rate table.

These things one must consider when one marries—

And everything I wear must come from Paris!

Oh, think of that!

Oh, think of that!

I can’t wear anything that’s not from Paris!

From top to toes

Quite Frenchified I am,

If you examine.

And then—who
knows?—

Perhaps some day a fam—

Perhaps a famine!

My argument’s correct, if you examine,

What should we do, if there should come a f-famine!

Though in
green pea

Yourself you needn’t stint

In July sunny,

In Januaree

It really costs a mint—

A mint of money!

No lamb for us—

House lamb at Christmas sells

At prices handsome:

Asparagus,

In winter, parallels

A Monarch’s ransom:

When purse to bread and butter barely reaches,

What is your wife to do for hot-house peaches?

Ah! tell me that!

Ah! tell me that!

What
is
your wife to do for hot-house peaches?

Your heart and hand

Though at my feet you lay,

All others scorning!

As matters stand,

There’s nothing now to say

Except—good morning!

Though virtue be a husband’s best adorning,

That won’t pay rates and taxes—so, good morning!

p. 536
THE
INDEPENDENT BEE

A
hive
of bees, as
I’ve heard say,

Said to their Queen one sultry day,

“Please your Majesty’s
high position,

The hive is full and the weather is warm,

We rather think, with a due
submission,

The time has come when we ought to swarm.”

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Up spake their Queen and thus spake she—

“This is a matter that rests with me,

Who dares opinions thus to form?

I’ll
tell you when it is time to swarm!”

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Her Majesty wore an angry frown,

In fact, her Majesty’s foot was down—

Her Majesty sulked—declined to sup—

In short, her Majesty’s back was up.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Her foot was down and her back was up!

That hive contained one obstinate bee

(His name was Peter), and thus spake he—

“Though every bee has shown
white feather,

To bow to tyranny I’m not prone—

Why should a hive swarm all
together?

Surely a bee can swarm alone?”

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Upside down and inside out,

Backwards, forwards, round about,

Twirling here and twisting there,

Topsy turvily everywhere—

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Pitiful sight it was to see

Respectable elderly high-class bee,

Who kicked the beam at sixteen stone,

Trying his best to swarm alone!

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Trying his best to swarm alone!

The hive were shocked to see their chum

(A strict teetotaller) teetotum—

The Queen exclaimed, “How
terrible, very!

It’s perfectly clear to all the throng

Peter’s been at the old
brown sherry.

Old brown sherry is much too strong—

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

Of all who thus themselves degrade,

A stern example must be made,

To Coventry go, you tipsy bee!”

So off to Coventry town went he.

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

There, classed with all who misbehave,

Both plausible rogue and noisome knave,

In dismal dumps he lived to own

The folly of trying to swarm alone!

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

All came of trying to swarm alone.

p. 547
THE
DISCONCERTED TENOR

A
tenor
, all singers
above

(This doesn’t admit of a
question),

Should keep himself quiet,

Attend to his diet,

And carefully nurse his
digestion.

But when he is madly in love,

It’s certain to tell on his
singing—

You can’t do chromatics

With proper emphatics

When anguish your bosom is
wringing!

When distracted with worries in plenty,

And his pulse is a hundred and twenty,

And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is,

A tenor can’t do himself
justice.

Now observe—(
sings a high note
)—

You see, I can’t do myself
justice!

I could sing, if my fervour were mock,

It’s easy enough if
you’re acting,

But when one’s emotion

Is born of devotion,

You mustn’t be
over-exacting.

One ought to be firm as a rock

To venture a shake in

vibrato
;

When fervour’s expected,

Keep cool and collected,

Or never attempt

agitato
.

But, of course, when his tongue is of leather,

And his lips appear pasted together,

And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is,

A tenor can’t do himself
justice.

Now observe—(
sings a cadence
)—

It’s no use—I
can’t do myself justice!

p. 553
THE
PLAYED-OUT HUMORIST

Quixotic
is his
enterprise, and hopeless his adventure is,

Who seeks for jocularities that haven’t yet
been said.

The world has joked incessantly for over fifty centuries,

And every joke that’s possible has long ago
been made.

I started as a humorist with lots of mental fizziness,

But humour is a drug which it’s the fashion to
abuse;

For my stock-in-trade, my fixtures, and the goodwill of the
business

No reasonable offer I am likely to refuse.

And if anybody choose

He may circulate the news

That no reasonable offer I’m likely to
refuse.

Oh happy was that humorist—the first that
made a pun at all—

Who when a joke occurred to him, however poor and
mean,

Was absolutely certain that it never had been done at
all—

How popular at dinners must that humorist have
been!

Oh the days when some stepfather for the query
held a handle out,

The door-mat from the scraper, is it distant very
far?

And when no one knew where Moses was when Aaron blew the candle
out,

And no one had discovered that a door could be
a-jar!

But your modern hearers are

In their tastes particular,

And they sneer if you inform them that a door can be
a-jar!

In search of quip and quiddity, I’ve sat
all day, alone, apart—

And all that I could hit on as a problem
was—to find

Analogy between a scrag of mutton and a Bony-part,

Which offers slight employment to the speculative
mind:

For you cannot call it very good, however great your
charity—

It’s not the sort of humour that is greeted
with a shout—

And I’ve come to the conclusion that my mine of
jocularity

In present Anno Domini, is worked completely out!

Though the notion you may scout,

I can prove beyond a doubt

That my mine of jocularity is utterly worked
out.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

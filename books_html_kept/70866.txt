INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.

The ensuing narrative was originally published in three successive
volumes, entitled respectively,ââ
Recollections
of the Eventful Life of a Soldier
âââ
The War in the
Peninsula
ââ
AND
â
Scenes and Sketches in Ireland
.â
Although these volumes were eminently successful, the form
in which they were brought out rendered them accessible
to only a comparatively small portion of the community.
They are now collected into one volume, and published at
a price which brings the work within the reach of all
classes of people.

The narrative, from its outset to its close in 1814,
embraces a period of about twenty-one years, fifteen of
which relate to the authorâs boyhood, and the remaining
six to his career in the army. The circumstance of the
work having been published anonymously will account for
the scrupulous care with which he has avoided making any
such allusions as might be calculated to draw aside the
veil of his incognito. In this Edition, however, the authorâs
name, the number of his regiment, and the rank he held in
[Pg iv]

it, are given; the names of places, so far as they could be
ascertained, and of individuals, so far as was deemed
prudent, which were left blank in the early Edition, have
been supplied in thisâbut in other respects the original
text has been preserved. The only part of the soldierâs
story which begets a feeling of disappointment is its abrupt
termination. The vicissitudes of his subsequent career
might have formed an interesting, though melancholy,
sequel to the present volume. The few particulars we
have gathered refer chiefly to that period of his life.

While in Ireland in 1814, about a year previous to the
conclusion of the narrative, the author married the individual
of whom, under the name of Mary MâCarthy, he
speaks in such high terms of admiration in the âScenes and
Sketches.â By this union he became the father of ten
children, seven of whom died in early life. In 1815, he
returned with his family to Glasgow, where he underwent
various changes of fortune, more particularly adverted to
in the narrative, which induced him âto resume the uniform
of a soldier.â He accordingly embarked with his family
for London, and enlisted in the service of the East India
Company, in which he was soon promoted to the rank of
recruiting sergeant. This occupation, while, contrary to
his wishes, it imposed on him the duty of remaining in
this country, afforded facilities for indulging those literary
and scientific predilections which had distinguished him in
the Peninsula; and he now endeavoured to turn them to
advantage by the study of anatomy and medicine. Thus
occupied, he remained in London, until, in 1817, he was
removed to Glasgow, where he began and completed
writing from memory the interesting âRecollectionsâ which
[Pg v]

form the first portion of this volume, the proceeds of which
enabled him still farther to prosecute his studies at the
University, where, âexchanging the tartan for the broadcloth,â
he mingled unobserved among the other students.
In consequence of his great dislike to the revolting practices
which at that time characterized the recruiting service, he
applied to Captain William Marshall, Superintendent of
the East India Company in Edinburgh, who, through the
influence of Colonel Hastings, got him transferred to the
situation of head-clerk in the Glasgow Military District
Office, where he remained for some years. During this
period, he completed, in rapid succession, the consecutive
portions of his âEventful Life.â

In 1827, having procured his discharge, he was enabled,
on the trifling proceeds of his literary labours, and by dint
of severe economy and close application, to take the degree
of surgeon. Shortly afterwards, he removed to the town
of Oban in Argyllshire, where he continued to practise his
new profession with as much success as a field so circumscribed
would permit, till the year 1829, when, wearied
with the proverbial drudgery of such a life, and anxious to
give greater scope to his talents, he once more embarked
for London, leaving his wife and children in Scotland.
With âmanners and dispositions not framed in the worldâs
school,â it is scarcely matter of surprise that in such a place
as the metropolis he failed to procure the employment he
sought. He remained there several months, occasionally
solacing his dreary hours with that species of literary
composition which was his chief delight. Besides contributions
to periodicals, he completed a work, entitled
âLife in Various Circumstances,â which, had not the MS.
[Pg vi]

been unfortunately lost, with other property, on its way
from France two years afterwards, might have precluded
the necessity of this brief and imperfect notice. Unsuccessful
in London, he proceeded to Paris, where, while
attending the anatomical academies, he died in October,
1830, of pulmonary disease, at the early age of thirty-seven.

Mrs Donaldson, from whom the foregoing particulars
have been obtained, still lives, but since her husbandâs
death, and, indeed, for some years previous, has suffered
severe privation and poverty. The sole dependence to
which she and her remaining daughter can look forward
with hope, is to this Edition of the recorded Recollections
of her husbandâs misfortunes, now published for her behoof.

AUTHORâS PREFACE.

The present Work was first published in separate volumes,
within a twelvemonth of each other, under the title of
âRecollections of an Eventful Life,â and âThe Peninsular
War.â The favourable reception they met with from the
Public, even in their unavoidably imperfect state, far
exceeded my most sanguine expectations. Many, indeed,
alleged âthat they were the production of some book-maker,â
and others âthat some person of literary ability must have
assisted the soldier.â Neither, however, is the fact. Such
as the narrative is, it was composed and written by me
without the slightest assistance. Indeed, I think it strange
that scepticism on that point should have been excited.
Why should not a soldier (if he has cultivated his natural
abilities) express himself in a tolerable manner as well as
an individual of a different class? It would be more
strange if a particular grade of men were to engross all the
talent existing; and it is only the presuming arrogance
of rank, or the overweening conceit of literary pedantry,
which would seek to shut the door against the exercise of
talent, merely because the individual does not enjoy any
of the arbitrary distinctions which they themselves have
created.

[Pg viii]

As to my being really an actor in the scenes I have described,
I believe little doubt now exists in the public mind.
I could at once dissipate it, by giving my name and the
number of my regiment; and I would have done so, were
it not that it might point out too minutely some ill-favoured
characters which I have given in the work. Fear for
myself would not prevent me; but I have no personal
enmity to gratify, and I shall feel sufficiently satisfied, if
the picture drawn deter others from following their
example.

My unsettled situation caused the former Edition of the
work to be so hurriedly written, that many errors escaped
notice, which, in the present, I have endeavoured to amend.
The two volumes are now thrown into one, forming a
continued narrative down to the close of the war, and
several incidents added, which were omitted in the first
Edition. If in its former state it excited an interest in the
public mind, I trust it is now rendered more worthy of its
approbation. I am aware that there are still imperfections
in it that will require indulgenceâan indulgence, however,
which, I am persuaded, will be readily conceded to the
humble station of

THE AUTHOR.

THE EVENTFUL LIFE OF A SOLDIER.

CHAPTER I.

I was born in Glasgow: my father held a situation in
a mercantile house, that enabled him to keep his family
respectable. I was the only surviving child, and no
expense would have been spared on my education, had
I been wise enough to appreciate the value of it; but,
unfortunately for me, that was not the case. I had
early learned to read; but novels, romances, and fairy
tales, were my favourite books, and soon superseded
all other kinds of reading. By this means, my ideas
of life were warped from reality, and the world I had
pictured in my imagination was very unlike the one
in which I lived. The sober realities of life became
tiresome and tasteless. Still panting after something
unattainable, I became displeased with my situation in
life, and neglected my educationânot because I disliked
it; on the contrary, I was fond of learning, and
used to form very feasible plans of study, wherein I
omitted nothing that was necessary to form the accomplished
gentleman. I could pleasingly, in imagination,
skim over the whole course of literature, and contemplate
my future fame and wealth as the result; but
when I considered how many years of arduous application
would be required, I was too impatient to put
it into practice. I had required too great a facility in
raising castles in the air, and embellishing them with
my fancy, to submit to the drudgery of building on a
more stable foundation. Thus, straining at shadows,
I lost substantial good.

Amongst other books which fell into my hands,
when very young, was Robinson Crusoe. It was a
great favourite; and at that time, I believe I would
willingly have suffered shipwreck, to be cast on an
[Pg 2]

island like his. An island to oneâs self, I thought,
what a happiness! and I have dreamed for hours
together, on what I would do in such a situation. I
have often played truant to wander into the fields, and
read my favourite books; and, when I was not reading,
my mind was perfectly bewildered with the romantic
notions I had formed. Often have I travelled eagerly
to the summit of some neighbouring hill, where the
clouds seemed to mark the limits of the world I lived
in, my mind filled with an indescribable expectation
that I would there meet with something to realise my
wild ideas, some enchanted scene or other; and when
I reached its summit, and found those expectations
disappointed, still the next similar place had the same
attraction. The sky, with the ever-varying figures of
the clouds, was an inexhaustible field for my imagination
to work in; and the sea, particularly those views
of it where the land could not be seen from the shore,
raised indescribable feelings in my breast. The vessels
leaving the coast, thought I, must contain happy souls;
for they are going far away,âall my fancied happy
worlds were there. Oh, I thought, if I could once
pass that blue line that separates the ocean and the
sky!âthen should I be content; for it seems the only
barrier between me and happiness.

I was often beat for being absent from school, and
urged to tell the cause. The reason I felt, but could
not describe; and, the same fault recurring again and
again, I was at last set down as incorrigible. What
most surprised my friends was, that I never had any
companions in my rambles; but a companion would
have spoiled all my visions. Never did I enjoy so
pure unmixed delight, as in those excursions: I feel
not now, as I then did, the novelty of life and nature;
but memory cherishes with fondness her first-born
feelings, and I regret that those happy days are gone
for ever.

So ill exchanged for riper times,

To feel the follies and the crimes,

Of others or my own.

[Pg 3]

In some old romances which I had read, the life of a
shepherd was described in colours so glowing, that I
became quite enamoured of it, and would not give my
parents rest until they procured such a situation for
me. It was in vain that they assured me I would find
every thing different in that life from what I imagined.
I could not believe it. They made some agreement
with a farmer, from whom they got their milk and
butter, to take me out with him to his farm, that I
might learn the truth by experience. I set off with
him on his buttermilk cart, my mind filled with the
most extravagant anticipations of my new employment,
and arrived at the farmerâs house at night. Next
morning I was called up at four oâclock to my new
avocation, and an old man was sent out with me to
show me my charge. I was left by him on a bleak
hill, with four-score sheep, and told that my breakfast
and dinner would be brought out to me. I sat down
to contemplate the scene; there were no sylvan groves,
no purling streams, no shepherds piping in the dale,ânothing
but peat-bog was to be seen for miles around;
the few scathed hills which reared their heads above
the blackened soil were covered with heather, which
still retained its winter suit; the shepherds had none
of the appendages attributed to them in poetry or
romance, they had neither pipe nor crook, and shepherdesses
there were none. I tried to transform the
female servant, who was in my masterâs house, into a
shepherdess; but it would not do. It was a horrible
caricature; she was a strong masculine looking
Highland girl, any thing but lovely or romantic.
Surely, thought I, there must be some mistake here.
I never spent a day so lonely and tiresome. My flock
seemed to think they had got a fool to deal with, for
they ran in every direction but the right one. It is
true I had a dog, but he did not understand my language.
We had not been long enough acquainted; and, by the
time night came, I was pretty well convinced that the
life of a shepherd was not what I had imagined it.
Day after day passed, without realising any of my
[Pg 4]

expectations. My feet got sore running through the
rough heather, and I returned to my parents about a
month after, completely cured of my predilection for a
shepherdâs life. One would think that this disappointment
would have rendered me more cautious in forming
opinions from the same sourceâbut no! Indeed, it
was ever my misfortune to pay dearly for my experience,
and to profit little by that of others.

CHAPTER II.

I found few boys of my own age, who entered into
my notions. One, indeed, I did find equally extravagant,
and we were scarcely ever separate. Tired of
living under the control of our parents, we determined
to make a bold push at independence. We mustered
as much money as bought the sixteenth of a lottery
ticket. In the interval between buying and drawingâhow
we did dream! It never entered our minds that
we would get less than the share of a prize of Â£30,000;
and, of course, the disposal of the cash was the constant
theme of our conversation. At last the wished for
day arrived, on which we were to receive intelligence
of the fate of our ticket. We did not go to inquire
concerning it until night. With hearts fluttering with
apprehension, we went to the shop where we had
bought it. I would not go in, but sent in my companion.
I durst scarcely look after him. To such an
intense pitch of interest was my mind wrought up,
that the criminal on his trial for some capital crime
could not wait with more dreadful anxiety for the
verdict of the jury, than I did for my companion to
come out. He did come, but I was afraid to look him
in the face, lest I should read disappointment in it. I
waited for him to speak, but his tongue refused its
office. I at last ventured to look in his face, and there
I read the truth. Had he spoken and told me it was
a blank, I might have doubted him, and thought he only
joked me; but I could never doubt the expression of
[Pg 5]

despair which I saw there depicted. Not a word was
exchanged, we walked on in stupified vexation. After
wandering about for some time unconscious of where
we were going, he at last burst into tears. I could
have willingly joined him, but I suspected that something
else preyed on his mind. On asking him what
distressed him so much, he said that part of the money
with which he had purchased his share of the lottery
ticket was the balance of an account, due to his father,
which he had received without his knowledge. He
depended on the receipt of his prize to pay it with
interest, but now those hopes were blasted; he could
never face homeâhis countenance would betray him,
and his father was very severe.

He said he was determined to go to Greenock, and
engage with some merchant vessel bound to Surinam.
He had an uncle a planter there, and, of course,
when he should arrive, there would be no danger of
him; his uncle would procure his discharge from the
ship, and the result, that he would become a gentleman.
I listened eagerly to this. We had often expatiated on
the pleasure of seeing foreign countries, and I resolved
to accompany him, not doubting but his uncle would
provide for me also, for his sake. Any thing like
adventure was always welcome to me, and my mind
was soon decided.

We had no money, however, to carry us to Greenock;
but I recollected a person who owed my father money,
and I proposed to go and ask it in my fatherâs name.
This was the first time I had ventured to do any
thing so glaringly dishonest, and I hesitated long. I
passed the door a dozen times before I mustered
effrontery enough to go in; but it was drawing near
the hour of shutting up, and I was obliged to resolve.
I went in and asked the money. The candle burned
dimly, and I stood as much in the shade as possible,
but I am sure he noticed my embarrassment. However,
he gave the money, and we hurried out of the
town immediately.

We travelled all night, and next morning arrived in
[Pg 6]

Greenock. After getting some breakfast, and brushing
ourselves up a little, although we were very tired, we
resolved in looking out for a vessel. On inquiry, we
learned that there was no vessel in the harbour bound
for Surinam. This was a disappointment; but, we
thought, if we were once in the West Indies, we would
find little difficulty in getting to the desired spot.

The first vessel we came to, was a ship bound for
Kingston, Jamaica. We went on board; and, inquiring
for the captain, asked if he wanted any men. He
looked at us with a smile of contempt, eyeing us from
head to foot, â
Men
,â said he, laying a particular
emphasis on the word, (for neither of us exceeded
thirteen years of age,) âit would be a pretty vessel that
would be mannâd with such
men as you
âWhaur hae
ye come frae na? Yeâll be some runawa weaver
callans frae Glasgow, Iâse warrant ye; but ye had
better gang hame again, for Iâm thinkinâ yeâll like the
sea waur than the loom.â We were galled by his
reply; but consoled ourselves with the idea that some
one else would be glad to get us.

After trying several other vessels with nearly the
same success, at last, tired and crest-fallen, we were
going home to our lodging, when an old man, who had
seen us going from one vessel to another, accosted us,
and asked if we wanted a ship. Replying in the
affirmative, âyou need not want that long,â said he,
âfor if you go with me, I will soon find one for you.
Where do you wish to go?â

âTo Surinam.â

âThen, you could not have come in a better time,
for there is a vessel lying in the roads ready to sail
for that place.â

âDo you think they will take us?â said we.

âOh, to be sure they will, and glad to get you, Iâll
take you on board now if you like.â

We assented, and he went to procure a boat to take
us on board.

When he was gone, a sailor, who was standing by
and saw us talking to the old man, came up, and asked
[Pg 7]

us what he had been saying. Having told him, he
said the sooner we were off out of that the better; for
the fellow, who had been talking to us, was one of a
set of rascals in the pay of the press-gang; and that,
instead of putting us on board of a vessel such as he
described, he would put us on board the Tender; and
that there was actually no such vessel in the roads as
the one he had mentioned. We lost no time in taking
his advice, and hurried home to our lodgings.

When there, my spirits began to sink; and the
thought of how I had left my parents, and the distress
they must be in about me, completely overcame me, and
I burst into tears; and my companion feeling as bad
as myself, we resolved to return home, and ask forgiveness
of our parents; but, being fatigued with travelling,
we put off our return until next morning.

When we got up next day, our minds had recovered
some of their former elasticity, and we felt less disposed
to return than we did the preceding evening. The
idea of the ridicule which we should have to encounter
from our acquaintance, and on my part, the stigma
which would be thrown on my character for drawing
the money in my fatherâs name, seemed to be insurmountable
barriers in the way, so we walked into the
town with our minds still undecided.

In crossing the main street, we met one of our old
school-fellows, who had run away from his parents
about six months before. He had just returned from
the West Indies; and having leave for a few days to
go to Glasgow to see his friends, he had got himself
rigged out in the jolly-tar styleâhis Jacket and trowsers
of fine blue cloth, white stockings, short-quartered shoes,
a black silk handkerchief tied loosely round his neck,
over which the collar of his checked shirt was folded
neatly downâa glazed hat on his head, and an enormous
quid of tobacco in his cheek. In fact, he was so
completely metamorphosed, that we scarcely knew him:
for when at school, he was remarked for being a soft,
dull sort of boy.

On seeing us, he seized a hand of each, and exclaimed,
[Pg 8]

âOh, my eyes! Joe and Bill! how are ye, my hearties?
what has brought you to Greenock; be you looking out
for a berth?â We were expressing our pleasure at
having met him, when he said, âDonât be standing here
in the street. Letâs go and get a glass of grog.â We
remarked, that it would look very odd for boys like us
to go into a tavern and call for liquor; but Tom thought
that a very foolish objection, and leading the way into
a tavern, we followed him. As he walked in before us,
I perceived that he had altered his manner of walking
quite to the rocking gait of the veteran tar. I certainly
thought that Tom had been an apt scholar; he seemed
to be as finished a sailor as if he had been twenty years
at sea. From being a boy of few words, he had acquired
a surprising volubility of tongue, along with an
affected English accent. He could curse and swear,
chew tobacco and drink grog; and although we perceived
much affectation in what Tom said and did, still
we were disposed to think him a very clever fellow.
When seated over our grog, we disclosed our minds to
him, and inquired if he could assist us in getting a
vessel. Tom looked rather grave on this subject, and
sinking his voice from the high English accent he had
acquired so rapidly, said he was not sure whether he
could get a vessel for us or not; âbut,â said he, âin
the mean time drink your grog, and we will see about
that after.â

Warmed by the liquor, Tom began and gave us an
account of his voyage, which, as he afterwards owned,
he painted in very extravagant colours. We were so
charmed with his description, that we gave up all idea
of going home, and adjourned from the tavern to Tomâs
lodgings, where he displayed to our wondering eyes the
treasures he had acquired by his West India voyageâconch
shells, cocoa nut, and stalks of Indian corn,
which were designed to grace his motherâs chimney-piece,
and excite the wonder of her visitors.

Between the liquor we had drunk, and what we had
heard and seen, we were in high spirits, and went out
to perambulate the town; but, going up the main
[Pg 9]

street, towards the head inn, I met my father full in
the face. He had just arrived from Glasgow in search
of us. I thought I would have sunk into the earth.
Confounded and ashamed, I stood like a felon caught
in some depredation. Tom ran off, and left William
and I to manage affairs as we could. My father was
the first who broke silence.â âWell, Joseph,â said he,
âwill you tell me the meaning of this jaunt you have
taken? But I am going to Mr Câââs, and you had
better come with me, and we shall talk over the matter
there.â We followed him without saying a word, and
when we were seated in Mr Câââs, he again asked
my motive for leaving home. I looked in Williamâs
face, and saw he was determined. I then said we
were resolved on going to sea, and that we had come
to Greenock for that purpose. Mr C. and my father
said every thing they could to dissuade us from our
foolish resolution, but to little purpose. The idea of
the ridicule we would have to bear from our acquaintance
if we returned, and Tomâs exaggerated description
of the pleasures of a sea life, had confirmed us in our
determination.

âWell,â said my father (after he had reasoned the
matter with me, and painted what a sailorâs life was
in reality, with little effect,) âI might exert the right
I have over you, as a parent, in forcing you to return,
but I will not. If you have so far forgot your duty to
me, and to yourself, after all that I have done for you,
as to throw yourself away as a common ship-boy,
where you can have no opportunity of learning any
thing but wickedness, you may do it, but remember
my wordsâ
you will repent it
, when you will perhaps
have no father to question the propriety of your conduct.
Indeed, after the dishonest action you have been guilty
of at home, I donât know but your presence would be
more disagreeable to me than your absence, unless you
altered much for the better; and if I have any very
anxious wish that you would return, it is more on your
poor motherâs account than my own. Oh, how could
you leave us in the manner you did, without a cause?âThe
[Pg 10]

first night you were absent from home, your
mother was frantic. She wandered from place to
place in search of youâand was sure you were not in
lifeâthat some accident had befallen you. When she
knows the truth, how cruel must she think you?âO!
Joseph, after all our care and attention, I am afraid
you will bring down our gray hairs with sorrow to the
grave.â

Here the tears came into my fatherâs eyes, and his
voice became choked. I could bear it no longer, and
burst into tears. My first impulse was to throw myself
at his feet, and beg forgiveness; but the obstacles
which were in the way of my return before, again
recurring to my mind, prevented me, and I only wept
in sullen silence.

âSay no more to him now,â said Mr C. âGive him
until to-morrow to think on what you have said; and
if he be then of the same opinion, we shall procure a
good ship for him, and see him properly fitted out.â
My father took his advice, and did not resume the
subject that day. He wrote, however, to Williamâs
father, telling where his son was.

Next morning, he arrived, and insisted on taking
him home by force, and even beat and abused him in
the house we were in; but my father and Mr C.
interfered and represented to him how foolish his
conduct was, as he might be sure the boy would take
the first opportunity of running away again. He was
at last brought to reason, and agreed to be guided by
my father. We were again asked what we had
determined on doing, and I replied that we were fixed
in our determination of going to sea.

It was then proposed to get us bound immediately
as my father could not be spared from his business, and
was obliged to return next day. Mr C. took us to a
friend of his, a Mr G. a respectable merchant and ship-owner,
who was in want of apprentices at that time
for some of his vessels. We were there bound for three
years, and attached to a letter-of-marque brig, which
carried 18 guns, loading at that time for New Providence.

[Pg 11]

The afternoon was spent in purchasing the necessary
articles to fit me out. When that was finished, my
father, feeling uneasy on my mothers account, resolved
to return to Glasgow that night. Before going away
he said, âI could almost wish your mother saw you
before you went awayâand yet, perhaps it would be
better that she would not. You will soon find yourself
among very strange company; and if I am not wrong
informed, company from whom you will be able to
learn little that is good; but I trust you will remember
the religious instruction you have received from your
parents, when you are far from them; and although
you have grieved and disobeyed your earthly parents,
I hope you will not forget your Creator. Remember
his eye is on you wherever you go; and although you
may be bereft of every other stay, still he will be ever
with you, to succour, and to help, if you call upon him.
Farewell, my boy, God help you!â

My heart sunk within me. As the coach started, I
saw him wipe the tears from his eyes. I must surely
be a hardened wretch, thought I, to persist so resolutely
in what I know to be wrong, and what is breaking the
heart of my parents; but I was roused from my reflections
by some one slapping me on the shoulder. It
was TomââWell, my boys, so you have got bound to
our ownerâhave you?â

âDo you belong to Mr G. also?â said I.

âTo be sure, and I donât think but I shall get into
your ship too, although she sails so soon; for I donât
like the one I am in.â

We felt well pleased that Tom was to be our shipmate;
and in the contemplation of all the good fortune
that I thought awaited me, I am ashamed to say, that
I nearly forgot my distressed parents.

As for William, the moment his father set off, (for
my father and his went up to Glasgow together,) the
poor fellow seemed quite relieved! His mother had
died when he was very young, and his father being a
man of a morose severe disposition, he scarcely knew
what parental tenderness was.âHow different from
[Pg 12]

me! He had some excuse for what he had done;
but I had none.

Tom went up to Glasgow next day, to see his friends;
and a day or two after, William and I were sent on
board, to commence our seamanship. The first day or
two passed away well enough. There was little or
nothing to do. The third day, the mate called us aft
to the quarter deck. âDo you see that flag?â said he,
pointing to the mast head. It had got entangled in the
signal halliards. âNow let me see which of you will
get up first and clear it.â

Will and I got on the shrouds, and mounted with
great alacrity, until we got to that part of the shrouds
which takes a sweep outwards to meet the edge of the
top. Will was up over it in a twinkling; for he had
been used to mount the rigging of the vessels at the
Broomielaw; but I thought it a dangerous-looking
place, and seeing a hole through the top, by the side
of the mast, I proceeded to squeeze myself through
it; which being an offence against the laws of good
seamanship, (as the sailorsâ name for it denotes, being
called the
lubberâs hole
,) the mate seized a ropeâs end
on deck, and running up the shrouds after me, called
out, âYou young dog! is that the way you are taking?â

I made haste to rectify my error by taking the same
route that Will had pursued; but, in my hurry, from
the fear of the ropeâs end, when I reached the edge of
the top, I let go the hold with my feet, and being suspended
by my hands, would soon have dropped on the
deck, or into the sea, had the mate not caught hold,
and assisted me up. Will had by this time got as far
as the cross-trees; but he was foiled in his attempts to
climb up the royal mast. The mate, however, thought
we had done enough for once, and we were ordered
down; but our exercise at this kind of work being
continued every day while in harbour, we soon became
expert at it.

[Pg 13]

CHAPTER III.

At last, the long-expected day of sailing arrived, and
among the first of the men who came on board was
Tom. He had received liberty to join our ship, and,
men and boys, we mustered about sixty hands. The
greater number, when they come on board, were âhalf-seas-over,â
and the ship was in great confusion.

Towards evening, it began to blow fresh, and I
became miserably sick. No one took any notice of
me, unless when I went to the weather-side of the
vessel to vomit, when some one or other of my tender-hearted
shipmates would give me a kick or a push,
and, with an oath, bid me go to leeward.

In this state I was knocked about from one place to
another, until at last I lay down in the waste of the
vessel, on the lee-side, with my head opposite to one
of the scuppers.
[1]
I had not been long there when some
one came running to the side. I looked up to see who
it was, and saw poor Tom in nearly as bad a plight as
myself. I was too sick to speak to him, or I would have
asked why he had omitted this in his description of the
pleasures of a sea life.

I had not seen William from the time I became sick;
but at that time I could feel interested for no one, or
about any thing. I only wished I were on shore; and
nothing should ever tempt me to put my foot on board
of a vessel again.

Night came on, and the weather being cold, I began
to wish that I could get below. I crawled to the first
hatchway I could find, which happened to be the
steerage. As this place was appropriated to the petty
officers of the ship, and they being all employed on deck,
I was allowed to get down unmolested. There were
some of the cables coiled in the steerage; and as I had
experienced the inconvenience of being in the way, I
crept in as far as I could, beyond the cables, where
some old sails were lying, and there, although not
[Pg 14]

relieved from sickness, I was at least free from
annoyance.

I had not been long there, when the steerage mess
came down to supper; and I quaked with terror when
I heard the gunner say, âI wonder where all those
boys are. I canât get one of them to do either one
thing or another.â

âTheyâll be stowed away in some hole or other, Iâll
warrant ye,â said the boatswain, âbut if I had hold of
them, I would let them feel the weight of a ropeâs end.â

I strove to keep in my breath lest they should hear
me, but at the moment my stomach heaved, and in
spite of all my efforts to suppress it, I made such a
noise that I was overheard.

âWho the devilâs that?â cried the boatswain; âsome
one of the rascals stowed away in the cable tierâhold
the lantern, and Iâll haul him out whoever
he is.â

Already I thought I felt the ropeâs end on my
shoulders, when I was unexpectedly relieved from my
apprehensions, by the mate calling them on deck to
arrange the watches for the night. While they were
gone, I squeezed myself behind some boxes, where I
was pretty sure they could not get at me. When
they came down again, they had forgotten the circumstance;
and those whose watch was below got into
their hammocks.

A little before daylight, I felt inclined to go on
deck, as I was nearly suffocated in my hiding-place,
and slipping out cautiously, got up the ladder without
disturbing any of them. I had felt pretty well settled,
when my head was down; but whenever I got up, the
sickness returned, and my stomach being completely
empty, my efforts were more distressing. An old
sailor who was standing near me advised me to take a
drink of salt water. I thought it was a rough cure;
I tried it, however, but it was no sooner down than up
again.

âTake another drink,â said he; I did soâthe same
result followed. He advised me to take a third.

[Pg 15]

âOh, no,â said I, âI can take no more.â

I then leaned over the lee bow of the vessel; and
whether it was the fresh air or the salt water I know
not, but I soon got better; and in the course of an hour
or two I began to move about pretty briskly.

While I was stirring about, the carpenter came
forward to me and inquired if I was sick. No, I
said.

âWill you have any objection to attend our mess?â

âI donât know, what have I to do?â

âOnly draw our provision, and boil our kettle
morning and evening.â

âVery wellâI am willing.â

He took me down to the steerage, and showed me
where things lay. When breakfast-time came I got
their kettle boiled, and brought down their mess of
bargoo, and sat down to take my breakfast with them;
but before I had taken half-a-dozen spoonfuls, it began
to discompose my stomach; and getting up to pass
them for the deck, the motion of rising brought the
contents of my stomach up to my mouth. I endeavoured
to keep it down, but was obliged to give it vent,
and it flew like water from a fire engine over the mess.
The boatswain, who was a surly old fellow, and who
had been the principal sufferer, rose up in a fury, and
seizing the wooden dish that held the bargoo, threw it
at my head. I escaped the blow of the dish, but the
contents came right on my face and blinded me. I
tried to grope my way up the ladder, but they did
not give me time to get up, for they threw me out of
the hatchway. When I got to my feet the whole of
the seamen on deck gathered round, and began to jeer
me on my appearance; but I managed to flounder on
through them to the head, where I got some water and
washed myself. Ah! thought I, this is hard usage;
yet I could scarcely refrain from laughing at the idea
of spoiling their mess.

I walked about the deck for some time, ruminating
on my folly in exchanging my comfortable home for a
place like this. Towards dinner-time, the carpenter
[Pg 16]

came and asked me to prepare the mess-dishes for
dinner, but I told him he might find some one else, for
I would not do it.

âThe more fool you are,â said he, âyou will soon
find yourself worse off.â

I was then obliged to shift my things into the forecastle
amongst the crew. Here I found William lying
in one of the berths, so sick that he could not lift his
head. When he saw me he beckoned me to him. âO
Joseph,â said he, âthis is misery. I wish we were at
home again; but I will never live to return.â

âNo fear of that,â I said, âI was as sick as you are,
and I am now nearly well.â

At this moment the vessel gave a heave, and down
I came on the deck. William began to make cascades,
and I was soon as bad as ever, and got tumbled into
the berth beside him. Shortly after, the seamenâs
dinner was brought down, and having served themselves,
one of them called out âYou green-horns, in there, will
you have some beef and biscuit?â

âNo, no,â said I, âbut if you will be kind enough to
open my chest, you will find a cake of gingerbread in
itâI will thank you to hand it to me.â

While he was searching for the gingerbread, he cast
his eyes on a large case bottle, filled with whisky,
which Mr C. had given me when I parted with him.
He immediately gave up his search for the gingerbread,
and hauling out the bottle and holding it up, he cried,
âDâân my eyes, messmates, if I haânât found a
prize.â

âHere with it,â cried a dozen voices at once, and in
spite of my remonstrances, they deliberately handed it
round until there was not above a glass left.

âOh shame,â said one of them, âgive the boy a drop
of his own grog;â but I could not look at itâthe smell
was sickening.

âNo, no,â said I, âsend that after the rest.â

âRight,â said one of them, âboys have no use for
grog.â

âWill you give me the gingerbread now?â said I.

[Pg 17]

âOh, by the by, I had forgot that, here it is for you,
my hearty.â

The most of them went on deck, and left William
and I to reflect on the justice of their appropriation of
my property. However, the liquor was a thing I cared
little about, and it gave me the less uneasiness. We
were now allowed to lie quietly enough until night,
when those whose watch was below came down to go
to bedâone of them came to the berth, where William
and I were lying, and seizing him by the neck, cried
out, âHollo, who the devilâs this in my berth?â

âIt is two of the Johnnie-raws that are sick,â replied
one of them.

âJohnnie-raw or Johnnie-roasted, they must get out
of that, for I want to turn in.â

Out we were bundled, and during the whole course
of that night we were knocked about from one place to
another, by each succeeding watch.

Next morning early, the word was passed for the
boys to go aft to the quarter-deck. It was hard rooting
them out; but at last we were musteredâsix in all.
When we were assembled, the mate addressing us, said,
âI think I have given you long enough time to recover
from your sickness. You, Tom, have no right to be
sick. You were at sea before.â I looked at Tom:
there was not a more miserable-looking object amongst
us. I could scarcely allow myself to believe that he
was the same being whom we saw swaggering on the
streets of Greenock a few days before. We were then
appointed to different watches. William and I were
luckily appointed to the same one, which being on duty
at the time, we were ordered to scrub the hen coops,
and feed the fowls, while the men washed the deck.
The boys were always made the drudges in every thing
dirty and disagreeable. But the duty of the ship
was little in comparison to the way in which we were
teased and ill used by the sailors. I have often been
roused up after a fatiguing watch, and just when I had
fallen into a profound sleep, to go and fetch a drink of
water for some of the crew. A fellow, of the name of
[Pg 18]

Donald MâMillan, was one of our chief tormentors.
He used to invent new mortifications for us; and he
was of so brutal and savage a disposition, that he
would beat and abuse the boys for the most trifling
fault, and often without cause. I am sure, if the
conduct of the men had been reported to the captain,
he would not have allowed the boys to be used in the
manner they were. But we were afraid to say any
thing concerning our usage, knowing that they could
find numberless methods of tormenting without openly
beating us.

I began, however, to get used to the sea; and taking
courage, I strove to get through as well as I could. It
was, nevertheless, with a great effort that I could
prevent my spirits from sinking under the many hardships
and contumely I had to endure. Nothing but
the hope of leaving the vessel when she returned home
kept me alive. Poor William lost all heart; he became
melancholy and moping, and used to cry for hours
together, when we were on watch at night. In this
state he was ill calculated for the duty he had to perform,
and was brow-beaten by almost every one in the ship.
This sunk his naturally buoyant spirits; and at length
he became so accustomed to ill usage, that he seemed
afraid I would also turn against him. I, however, had
known him in happier days; but his feelings were
morbidly acute, and little calculated to struggle through
the ill usage which a ship apprentice had to endure.

As we proceeded on our voyage, the weather became
delightful; and getting into the trade winds, we got
on so pleasantly, often for days together, without
changing a sail, that had we not been tormented by the
seamen, we would have been comparatively comfortable.
But the only happy periods I enjoyed were,
when my turn came to look out aloftâseated on the
cross-trees, away from the din of the deck, with the
clear blue sky above, and the sea extending far as the
eye could reach beneath. It was there I almost realised
some of the fairy scenes I had pictured in my
imagination. I felt myself in an enchanted world of
[Pg 19]

my own, and would sit watching the clouds as they
passed along, comparing their shape to some romantic
image in my mind, and peopling them with corresponding
inhabitants. So lost was I in those reveries that I
did not feel the time passing; and when the man came
up to relieve me, I have often volunteered to stop his
two hours also. When I came down on deck, I felt
as it were cast from heaven to earth, and used to
long for my turn to look out again. These were the
only pleasures I enjoyed unmolested and unenvied; for
few of my comrades required any pressing to allow me
to remain in their place. The nights were now delightful;
the moon shone in âcloudless majesty,â and the
air was so cool and pleasant, that it was preferred by
the seamen to the day: instead of going below, they
often gathered in knots on the deck, and played at
various games, or told stories. Many of them were
good at this. One of them, a Swede, had as large a
collection as any person I ever knew; they were those
of his countryâmostly terrificâghosts and men possessed
of supernatural powers, were the heroes of his
stories.
[2]
The flying Dutchman, and many other
[Pg 20]

naval apparitions, were talked of and descanted on
with much gravity. Sailors, in general, are very
superstitious, and these stories were listened to with
the greatest attention.

One night the weather was hazy, when I was appointed
to look out a-head along with an old sailor,
who was remarkable for being an attentive listener
when any stories were telling. The moon was up;
but a dense curtain of clouds hid her almost completely
from our view. The wind came in gusts, and swept
the clouds along in irregular masses. Sometimes a
doubtful light would be thrown around us; again a
dark cloud would intervene, and we could scarcely see
the end of the jib-boom. The wind whistled through
the rigging of the vessel occasionally with a low
murmuring sound; then it would rise gradually to
such a fury, that we could scarcely hear each other
talk. We were anxiously looking out, when he asked
me if I did not see something like a sail a-head. I
replied that I did not. He pointed to the place where
he imagined he saw it. I looked again. A partial
gleam of light, occasioned by a cloud of lighter texture
passing over the moon, being thrown on the place, I
really thought I saw something like a sail. He did not
wait for any more investigation, but gave the alarm.
The mate came forward to see it; but the light was so
uncertain, that he could not decide on what it was.
The watch gathered about the bows of the vessel, every
one having something to say on the subject. One
pretended he saw a sail plainlyâshe was a square-rigged
vessel, with all her sails set; another said she
was schooner rigged. Ominous whispers now began to
[Pg 21]

go round, intimating that her appearance was anything
but natural. The mate, hearing some hints that
were dropped, said, âThere was a cursed deal too much
of that ghost story-telling of late; and he would lay
his head to a marlin-spike, that this would turn out to
be no sail after all.â At this moment (luckily for his
prediction) the moon broke through in all her splendour;
and as far as the eye could reach, not a speck on the
surface of the dark blue waters could be traced. The
laugh was now turned against those who had pretended
to see the sail; but they only shook their heads doubtfully,
and wished that nothing bad might follow. I
venture to say that every one on board joined in that
wish.

FOOTNOTES:

[1]
Scuppers, the holes by which the water runs off the deck.

[2]
One of the stories he narrated was of a seaman with whom his
father had sailed. He was a wonderful fellow: he could arrest a
ship in full sail. When he wanted liquor, he had nothing to do but
bore a hole in the mast, and out flowed rum, brandy, or any liquor
he wished for. He once had committed some crime, for which he
was sentenced to be flogged; the crew were assembled, and the
culprit stripped and tied up; the boatswain raised his brawny arm
to give the lash, but by some invisible power his arm was arrested
in the air, and he stood with it stretched out, unable to bring it
down. The master-at-arms raised his cane to strike the boatswain
for his seeming neglect of duty, and his arm was arrested in like
manner. The captain, enraged to see both boatswain and master-at-arms
in the strange position, drew his sword, and raised it, to let it
fall on some of their heads, when he shared the same fate. Thus all
three stood with their arms upraised in air; nor would our hero
release them from their awkward position, until he was pardoned
and taken down. Some time after, he committed another crime;
but they were afraid his power was too potent on board for them to
proceed against him there: therefore he was conveyed ashore, and
tried. In addition to the alleged crime, they brought forward a
charge of dealing with the devil. The proof was reckoned conclusive,
and he was sentenced to suffer death. He gave himself no uneasiness
about it. The day arrived on which he was to be executed; and the
guard entered his prison for the purpose of conveying him to the
place of execution. When they entered, he was busily drawing a
ship upon the wall with chalk; he requested them to wait a moment
until he would finish it. They did so. When he had done, he bade
those about him adieu; and lifting his foot, as if it were to step
into his mimic ship, he disappeared from their eyes in a moment,
and was never heard of after.

CHAPTER IV.

A few days after that, we fell in with a vessel which
we hailed, and found she was bound for Greenock
from Jamaica. She brought to; and all those who
wished to send letters to their friends were ordered to
make haste and write them. I got out my writing
materials; but I was at a loss what to say. Had I
been inclined to tell the truth, I would have been at no
loss; but I could not bear the idea of owning how
grossly I had been deceived in my ideas of a sailorâs
life. However, I believe I gave them room to think
that I did not like it very well. I had lost so much
time in resolving what to write, that the letters were
called for before I had time to give any particulars.
When I was sealing my letter, I ardently wished I
could insinuate myself inside of it.

Nothing particular occurred during the rest of our
voyage, until a few days before we made the land.
One morning early a sail appeared to windward, the
captain looking at her through his telescope, was of
opinion that she was a French privateer. All hands
were called to quarters; and as she bore down upon
us, the captainâs opinion was confirmed, for she fired
[Pg 22]

a gun, and hoisted French colours. We were well
manned, and carried as many guns as she appeared to
do. Every thing was prepared for action; only the
guns were not run out, and the ports were down.
The captain had ordered all the men, with the exception
of the petty officers, to lie down on the deck,
concealed behind the bulwarks, until he should give
the word of command. She was bearing fast down
upon us, when I was ordered to the magazine to hand
up ammunition. I was frightened enough when on
deck; but when below, I became much more so. It
was not long before a broadside was fired. I was
sure it was from the enemy, and, stunned with the
noise, fell flat on my face. âGod be merciful to me!â
said I: for I was sure we were going to the bottom.
In a minute after, I was surprised with the men cheering
on deck. I mounted the ladder; and venturing
my head up the hatchway, saw the strange ship a good
way to leeward, making all the sail she could. On
inquiring, I found that she had borne down close on
us, thinking we were an unarmed merchant ship, and
ordered us to strike. The reply we gave was what
had alarmed me so much; for our men, starting to
their feet on the word of command from the captain,
ran out the guns, and gave her a broadside. She was
so completely taken in by the reception she met with,
that she sheered off without firing a shot. The
captainâs orders were, not to deviate from his course,
else we might have captured her.

We now drew near the land, and the lead was
frequently hove to ascertain what sort of a bottom we
had.
[3]
Pieces of sugar-cane, melons, and fruit of
various kinds, were floating about; birds, in great
numbers, hovered about the ship; and every thing
intimated that the land was nigh. It was my turn to
look out aloft, and I felt sure of the bottle of rum which
is usually given to the man who espies land first. I
[Pg 23]

was not long up, when I thought I saw land off the
lee bow. I watched it attentively. It became better
defined every minute. I was positive it was land, and
I sung out, âLand, ho!â with a joyous voice. The
intelligence ran through the crew; and I saw them
skipping about on deck, seemingly delighted with the
news. The mate came up beside me to see where the
land lay. I pointed it out to him; but it soon altered
its appearance, and began slowly to move up from the
verge of the horizon, and in less than ten minutes not
a vestige of the appearance remained. To me it looked
like enchantment; but I learned from the mate that
such sights were not uncommon, and were termed by
the seamen, âCape Flyaway.â

In the course of the day we made the real land, but
were too late to get into the harbour that night. However,
next morning early we got in, and came to anchor
nearly opposite Fort Charlotte, town of Nassau, after
a passage of six weeks. As we entered the harbour,
we found a sloop-of-war lying there: and some of our
men, afraid of being pressed, took a boat, and made
towards the shore; but the officers of the man-of-war
observing them, they sent a boat in pursuit. Our fellows
pulled hard, and would have made the shore before
them, had they not fired a musket shot or two, and
obliged them to lie to. They were then all taken on
board the sloop-of-war; but in the course of the day
they were sent back, with the exception of Donald
MâMillan, who had given some insolence to the
officers; and they sent word that they had kept him
to teach him better manners. The boys did not mourn
much at his detention, nor, I believe, did any of the
crew; for his disposition was such, that every one
hated him.

We were not long at anchor before we were surrounded
by canoes from the shore, with black fellows
in them, selling fruit of various kinds, not common in
Britain. Here we got rid of some of our money, in
exchange for bananas, guavas, and pine apples; and I
almost forgot all my sufferings in the novelty of the
[Pg 24]

scene around me. The white sandy beach, the light
ornamented wooden buildings, walks bordered by palm
and cocoa-nut trees, with the singular dresses of the
planters and their negroes, were objects which made
me think myself in a new world. In the course of the
day we got off fresh beef and plenty of vegetables,
which was a treat, having had nothing but salt provision
from the time of leaving Greenock; and to complete
our happiness, we got an extra allowance of rum sent
from the owners of the cargo.

Next day we began to deliver the cargo. There
was no quay, but wharfs here and there to the different
stores. When the tide was in, we got our boats unloaded
by means of a crane; but at low water we were
obliged to push the hogsheads from the boats into the
sea, and wading up to the middle to roll them out
before us to the shore. This was most fatiguing and
disagreeable work; therefore we were not sorry when
it was finished. On Sundays, (the negroesâ market-day
in the West Indies,) the half of the crew alternately
got leave to go ashore. William and I happened to be
of the first party, and we were delighted with every thing
around us; but we could not discover that the inhabitants
were disposed to give their money away for
nothing any more than at home. Nor could we find
anything to justify the notion, that a rapid fortune
could be acquired there, without similar exertion to
that we had been accustomed to see in other places.
After taking a view of the town, and purchasing some
shells and other curiosities, we came on board well
pleased with the holiday we had had on shore. Soon
after this, we began to take in our cargo, which consisted
principally of rum, cotton, and coffee.

As yet it had been delightful weather, only excessively
warm in the middle of the day; but the mornings and
evenings were very pleasant. The third morning, after
we began to take in our cargo, came on sultry and close.
The air was oppressiveâthe clouds hung low and heavy,
and ere long the rain burst out in torrents. This had
not continued ten minutes, until we were up to our
[Pg 25]

knees in water on the deck. It poured down so fast
that it could not escape by the scuppers. The earth
seemed threatened with another deluge. The whole
face of the heavens was dark as night. The crew were
all employed in striking the top-gallant masts, lowering
the yards, and making everything snug. âThis is
shocking rain!â said I to an old sailor who stood near
me.

âYes,â said he; âbut we will have worse than rain
by and by.â He had scarcely said so, when the heavens
seemed to open, and a flash of lightning burst forth,
so strong and vivid that it took the sight from my eyes.
A clap of thunder followed so loud and long that it must
have appalled the stoutest heart. Flash after flash
succeeded each other, and the peals of thunder were
incessant. I thought the last day was come. Heaven
and earth seemed jumbled together in one mass of fire,
and the continued noise of the thunder struck my
imagination as the result of the fabric falling to
ruin.

Towards the afternoon the wind blew with great
fury. The vessels in the harbour began to drag their
anchors, and before night many of them were on shore;
but we were well moored, and did not stir. The storm
continued the greater part of the night; and such a
night I hope I will never see again. No one would go
below. We did not know the moment the lightning
might strike the vessel, and perhaps send her to the
bottom. It is in vain for me to attempt to convey any
adequate description of that dreadful night in words.
No one can form an idea of its awfulness, unless he had
seen it. The men stood huddled in groups, on the deck,
in silence. Indeed it was useless to speak, for they
could not be heard; nor scarcely could they see each
other, unless when the lightning shot its awful glare
athwart their faces, and made their horror visible for an
instant: and the livid cadaverous colour it shed over
their countenances, gave them an expression truly
appalling.

About one oâclock in the morning, the storm began
[Pg 26]

to moderate; the flashes of lightning became weaker,
and less frequent; the awful roaring of the thunder
changed into a hoarse growl, and at length died away.
By two the storm had so much subsided, that the seamen,
with the exception of the harbour watch, went
below to their hammocks.

I was surprised next morning, when I got up at
sunrise, to see no vestige of the nightâs storm remaining.
All was calm and serene, save a pleasant breeze
from the shore, which brought the most delicious
odours along with it. The sun rose with unusual
brightness, and all nature seemed renovated. We
could not, indeed, have imagined that there had been
a storm the preceding night, if the effects of its fury
had not been visible in the roofless buildings and
stranded vessels around us.

Our vessel had suffered little or no damage. We got
on with our loading, and in a short time we were ready
for sea. The day before we sailed, the owners sent
a present of a bottle of rum to each man, to hold a sort
of âchevo,â as the sailors called it. The decks were
cleared, and we sat down in groups with our bottles,
and commenced drinking. Ail went on very well for
a time. The song and joke went round, and harmony
and good humour prevailed. But when the drink
began to operate, some of them who had differences
during the voyage began to âtell their minds.â The
result was, that they came to high words, and from
that to blows. The rest of the crew took different
sides, according as they were interested; and the deck
soon became a scene of confusion and bloodshed. I
had drunk little, and mounted into the foretop to be
out of âharmâs way;â and from thence saw the combat,
without danger of getting any of the blows which were
dealing out so plentifully. The mate came forward
to try to quell the disturbance; but they knocked him
over a kedge anchor that lay on the deck, and broke
one of his ribs.

At length the disturbance died away, and I came
down on deck. Some deep drinkers had gathered the
[Pg 27]

bottles which had escaped destruction during the fight,
and were emptying their contents. Others were lying
insensibly drunk and vomiting. Broken bottles, with
their contents promiscuously mixed on the deck with
the blood of the combatants, lay scattered about in
every direction. I never saw such miserable-looking
wretches as they were next morning. Most of them
were âhorrified.â Almost all of them bore marks of
the late frayâblack eyes, swelled lips, sprained thumbs,
&c. &c. As the vessel was to sail that day, the captain,
in order to bring them about a little, served them out
their grog, and they quickly got to rights again.

We got up our anchors, and set sail with a fair
wind. I could not describe the emotions I felt, when
I saw the vesselâs head turned homewards. I was all
joyous anticipation of meeting with my parents. âI
shall never leave them again,â thought I. âI shall
obey them in everything, and we shall be so happy.
I have seen my folly, and I shall make a good use of
my experience.â

Nothing particular occurred on the passage home,
until we got near the British coast, when the weather
became extremely cold. The look-out aloft was no
longer a pleasant berth. I have often been so benumbed
when the man came up to relieve me, that I could
scarcely move my limbs to come down upon deck.
The weather had been rough for some time, but one
afternoon it began to blow uncommonly hard. The
wind was fair, however, and the captain seemed unwilling
to take in sail, but the gale increasing, he
ordered the top-gallant sails to be handed. William
and I, with another boy, went up to hand the main
top-gallant sail. The vessel was pitching dreadfully.
William went to the weather, and I went to the lee
earing to haul in the leach of the sail. The part which
bound the yard to the mast gave way, and it pitched
out with such violence, that William was shook from
his hold, and precipitated into the sea. I got a dreadful
shock. This was an awful moment. Every pitch
that the vessel gave, the yard was thrown out from the
[Pg 28]

mast with such force, that it was a miracle I escaped.
The other boy had got in on the mast, but it appeared
impossible for me to follow him. Nothing could save
me, unless the despairing hold that I retained, and
I could not have kept it long, for every shock rendered
me weaker; but some of the seaman were sent up with
a loose line, and succeeded in bracing the yard to the
mast, and I was relieved from my perilous situation.

Poor William! I saw him fall. âO God!â he cried,
as he fell. I heard no more. The next moment he
was swallowed by the waves. They told me he never
rose. It was impossible to do anything to save him
in such weather with any effect. His fate made a great
impression on my mind, for he was my only companion.
He was a clever boy, warm-hearted, and kind in his
disposition, although he had become quite broken-hearted.
Nor did he seem relieved from his melancholy
by the prospect of returning home; for he was
sure that his father would do nothing to get him free
from the ship; and even if he did, he could feel little
pleasure in the anticipation of his usage there. âO
Joseph!â he would often say, âIf I had a father and
mother like yours, how happy would I be! but I may
truly say that I am an orphan! To be sure, while
my mother was living, she was everything that was
good and affectionate to me; but when she died, I lost
the only friend I had in the world, for my father never
was kind to me, and after he married again, I never
had a happy minute in the house; and if I were to go
home again, even supposing that he would get me free
from the ship, things would be worse than before.
But I am sure I will not live to return. There is a
heavy something hangs on my mind, that tells me I
will not see the end of this voyage; but I do not feel
grieved at it, I rather feel a pleasure in the idea. Then
I will be free from ill usage and persecution; and what
makes me long for my death, is the hope that I will
meet my mother in heaven, never to part from her
again.â I could not forbear weeping when he spoke in
this manner; and I tried to cheer him as much as I
[Pg 29]

could, by putting him in mind of our former schemes of
happiness and fortune; but he only shook his head,
and said, âThis is not the world we dreamed it was;
but even so, I have no friends, no prospects, and death
appears to me to be the only thing that can alter my
situation for the better.â Poor fellow! he little thought
it was so near.

The gale still continued to increase, and all our sails
were taken in, with the exception of a close-reefed
fore-top-sail. The wind veered about, and blew a
hurricane. Some of the sails were torn in ribbons
before they could be handed. The sea ran mountains
high. The sky was darkened, and the flapping of the
sails and rattling of the blocks made such a noise that
we could scarcely hear our own voices. The sea broke
over us in such a way that boats, spars, and camboose,
were carried off the deck, and the helm became almost
totally unmanageable, although four men were constantly
at it. When a sea struck the vessel, she creaked as if
her very sides were coming together. The men were
obliged to lash themselves to every place where they
could find safety, to prevent their being washed overboard;
and in this manner we stood in awful suspense,
waiting the issue of the storm. One minute she would
rise, perched as it were, on the verge of a precipice;
the next, she would descend through the yawning gulf
as if she would strike the very bottom of the sea, while
vivid flashes of lightning contributed to throw a horrific
glare over the scene.

Three days were we tossed about in this manner,
every day expecting it to be our last, for we thought
it impossible that the ship could weather the gale.
During that time we could not get below, the hatches
being battened down, and we had to subsist on dry biscuit,
or eat raw pork with it, for we could get nothing
cooked.

On the fourth day the storm abated, and the weather
cleared up, but the vessel rolled so that we expected
her masts to go overboard. After the gale we fell in
with some vessels which had suffered severely, one in
[Pg 30]

particular had lost all her masts. We were at this
time near the mouth of the Channel; and next day,
we made Cape Clear. I could not express what I felt
at again seeing the shores of Britain. My imagination
was hard at work drawing pictures of the future. We ran
up along the Irish coast with a fair wind, and at last
came in sight of the well-known Craig of Ailsa; and
passing it, and the Cumbrays and the Clough light-house,
we anchored in Greenock roads. I was in transports
of joy at the idea of getting home again; but a doubt
would often cross my mind, whether my father might
feel inclined to get me free from the vessel, after so
obstinately persisting in going to sea; I, at least, felt
sensible that I did not deserve such indulgence. The
day after we arrived, however, my mind was set at
ease, for my mother came from Glasgow to see me,
and the first words she said, were, âWell, Joseph, are
you tired of the sea?â The tears came into my eyes,
but I could not speak. âI find you donât like it,â said
she: âyou have found out, I believe, that your fatherâs
description of a sea life was a true oneâwell, we must
try and get you home again.â A day or two afterwards,
my father came to Greenock, and having settled matters
with the owners, I went home with him on the coach,
fully resolved that I should be more wise in future. I
had a joyful meeting with my friends, and, for a time,
all went on pleasantly; but my restless disposition still
remained the same, and I soon grew tired of home.
My parents expected a miraculous change in me; and
when they found that my voyage had made me little
wiser, any indiscretion was generally checked with an
allusion to my former conduct. This irritated my
feelings. Those boys who used to associate with me
now avoided my company; most of them, I believe, by
the injunction of their parents. There were two boys
with whom I had been on the most friendly termsâtheir
parents and mine were very intimateâthey were
constant playfellows of mine before I went to sea, and
I had occasionally seen them after my return, without
their seeming any way reserved towards me. Some
[Pg 31]

months after I came home, however, I happened to be
diverting myself with them in their court-yard, we were
playing at
hide-and-seek
, having hid myself in the
straw-house, I heard their father call them and ask
who was with them; when they told him, he said,
âNever let me see you in that boyâs company again, for
he ran away from his parents, and he may induce you
to do the same.â This went like a dagger to my heart.
It humbled me severely in my own eyes. I waited
until he went into the house, and then slunk away like
a felon. From that day I thought every one who
looked at me were passing similar observations in their
minds. My temper became soured, and I grew melancholy
and restless. I brooded continually over the
indignity which I conceived I had suffered. âThen,â
said I to myself, âI have become an object of contempt
to every one. I can never endure thisâI will not
remain in Glasgow.â

CHAPTER V.

One evening, in January, 1809, returning from
dinner to school, brooding over my real or imaginary
evilsâmy mind in such a state of despondency that I
could almost have taken away my life,âI determined
to leave Glasgow, for, I thought, if once out of it I
should be happy. In this state of mind, walking down
the High Street, I met a soldier. The thought struck
me instantly that I would enlist, although I rather felt
a prejudice against the army. Yet, by enlisting, I
would get out of Glasgow, and to me that was everything.
I followed the soldier, and asked him where
his officer lodged. He showed me the place, and I
enlisted, with the proviso that he would send me out
of the town immediately. I was sent to Paisley, and
remained with the party there until the recruits were
ordered to march for head-quarters. When I came
into Glasgow to join them, in passing through the
Bridgegate, I met my mother. I had never written to
[Pg 32]

my parents, nor had they heard of me from the time I
enlisted. I could scarcely define my feelings: shameâgriefâa
sort of sullen despairâa sense that I had cut
myself off from the worldâthat I had done my worst, and
a determination to push it to the utmostâwere mingled
together in my mind. My mother first broke silence.
âPoor, infatuated boy!â said she, the tears flowing down
her cheeks, âwhat new calamity have you brought on
yourself by your wild, inconstant disposition?â I told
her I had enlisted, and was going that day to join my
regiment,ââAlas!â said she, âyou have now finished it.
Now you are lost to us and to yourself; but will you not
come home, and see your father before you go?â I
hesitated. âPerhaps,â said she, âit will be the last
time you may ever see him. Come, you had better go
with me.â I consented, and we went home together.
It was near four oâclock. My father generally came
at that hour to dinner. My mother met him as he
came in, and explained matters to him. He strove to
assume an air of calmness; but his countenance showed
the emotions that were working in his mind. We sat
down at the table to dinner; but no one seemed inclined
to eat. My father cut some meat on his plate, but
instantly pushed it from him. He rose from his seat,
and walked about the floor with a rapid pace. He
opened his waiscoat.âHe seemed suffocating. I could
no longer endure to see the convulsive agony with which
his whole frame was agitated. I sunk on my knees at
his feet, and cried out, âForgive me, O fatherâforgive
me!â

He looked at me for a moment: then, bursting into
tears, he said, âGod forgive you! God forgive you! my
poor unfortunate boy. Alas!â said he, âI had none
but you. I had formed schemes for your advancement
in life. I saw you had some talent, and was determined
to spare no expense in making you fit to fill a respectable
situation. I had figured to myself you going in and
out with me, happy and contentedâa credit to yourself
and to your parents; but, alas! those hopes are now
fled for ever: for the first news I hear of you, may be
[Pg 33]

that your corpse is bleaching on the Continentâa prey
to wolves and eagles.â Then, as if correcting himself
for drawing such a pictureââBut your life is in the
hands of God. Yet even now, are you not lost to me?
May I not say that I am childless?âI give you my
forgiveness freely, and also my blessing; and if you
should survive, oh! may you never have a son that
will cause you such agony as I feel at this moment.
Farewell! my poor boy; I am afraid I may say Farewell
for ever!â With these words he rushed into an
adjoining room, and threw himself on his knees, I
suppose to pray for that son who had repaid all his
kindness with ingratitude and disobedience. My
mother was wild with grief. It was the hour at which
we were to march. I tore myself out of the house in
a state of distraction, and joined the party, who were
now on the road to Airdrie. My mind was in such a
state of agitation, that I scarcely knew where I was
going. I walked on before the party, as if some evil
thing had been pursuing me, anxious, as it were, to
run away from my own feelings.

I am scarcely conscious of what passed between that
and Dunbar; it seems like a confused dream. But the
parting scene with my father often recurred to my
memory; and although it is now fifteen years since it
took place, it remains in it as fresh as yesterday. The
step I took at that time has been to me the source of
constant and unavailing regret; for it not only destroyed
my fair prospects in life, and fixed me in a situation
that I disliked, but I believe it was the means of
breaking the heart of a parent, whose only fault was
that of being too indulgent. I felt sensible of his
tenderness, and I am sure I loved him. But mine was
a wayward fate. Hurried on by impulse, I generally
acted contrary to the dictates of my own judgmentââMy
argument right, but my life in the wrong.â

He has long gone to his eternal rest; but while he
lived, he was a manâtake him all in allâwhose
equal will be rarely found; for it could truly be said
of him, that âeven his failings leaned to virtueâs side.â

[Pg 34]

When our party arrived in Dunbar, where the
regiment lay, after being finally approved, and the
balance of my bounty paid, which was about four
guineas, (after deducting necessaries,) I was conducted
by the sergeant to the room where my berth was
appointed. When he left me, I sat down on a form,
melancholy enough. An old soldier sat down beside
me; and, remarking that I looked dull, asked me
where I came from, when I replied, âGlasgow.â

I was immediately claimed as a townsman by some
of the
knowing ones
, one of whom had the Irish brogue
in perfection, and another the distinguishing dialect
and accent of a cockney.

âYou donât speak like natives of Glasgow.â said I.

âOch! stop until you be as long from home as me,â
said Paddy, giving a wink to his comrades, âand you
will forget both your mother-tongue and the mother
that bore you.â

âHaâ ye got yere boonty yet, laddie?â said an
Aberdeen man.

âYes,â said I.

âThan youâll no want for frienâs as lang as it lasts.â

So I found; for every little attention was paid me
that they could devise. One brushed my shoes,
another my coat; and nothing could equal the many
professions of good-will and offers of service I received.
There was a competition amongst them who should be
my comrade, each supporting his offer by what service
he would render me, such as cleaning my accoutrements,
teaching me my exercise, &c. It appeared to me that
I was set up at auction to be knocked down to the
highest bidder. But I paid little attention to them.
My mind was taken up, thinking of my folly, and
ruminating on its consequences.

After holding a private consultation amongst themselves,
one of them took me aside, and told me it was
the usual custom for each recruit, when he joined the
company, to give the men of the room he belonged to
a âtreat.â

âHow much?â said I, putting my hand in my
[Pg 35]

pocket; for, in the passive state of mind I was then in,
they would have found little difficulty in persuading
me to give them all I had.

âA guinea,â was the reply.

âWhy didnât you ask two?â said an old fellow aside
to the spokesman, when he saw me give the one so
freely. He seemed vexed that he had not.

It was then proposed to go into the town, to purchase
the liquor; and I, of course must go along with
them. Four or five accompanied me to town, and we
met two or three more as if by accident. As we
returned home, they lingered behind me a little, and
appeared to be consulting about something. When
they came up to me, one of them said, as I had been
so free in treating them, they could not do less than
treat me; and led the way into a public-house for that
purpose. One half pint of whisky was called in after
another, all protesting that they would be their share;
but when the reckoning came to be paid, which
amounted to seven or eight shillings, each asked his
neighbour to lend him until he went up to the barracks.
It turned out, however, that none of them had any
money; and it ended in a proposal that I should pay
the whole, and they would repay me on pay-day.
This opened my eyes a little. I thought I could see a
great deal of meanness and trick in their conduct; but
I seemed to take no notice of it.

When night came, the room was cleared, and the
forms ranged around. An old Highlander in the
room had a pair of bagpipes, which, with two fifes,
constituted our music, and when we were all assembled,
the drinking commenced, handing it round from one
to another. After a round or two, old Donaldâs pipes
were called for, and the men commenced dancing with
the women of the company. The stamping, hallooing,
and snapping of fingers which ensued, intermingled
with the droning sound of the bagpipes, was completely
deafening. In the confusion some of the thirsty souls
took the opportunity to help themselves out of their
turn, which being observed, caused a dispute; and the
[Pg 36]

liquor being expended, a join of a shilling a man was
proposed to âcarry on the glory.â I was again applied
to, and aided by this fresh supply, they kept up âthe
spreeâ until one oâclock in the morning. When some
of them who had got drunk began to fight, the lights
were knocked out, and pokers, tongs, and tin dishes
were flying about in every direction. At last the
affair ended by the officer of the guard sending some of
them to the guard-house, and ordering the others to
bed.

Next morning I was besieged, before six oâclock,
by a band of the fellows who had got drunk the night
before, begging me to treat them to a glass to âheal
their head.â I felt little inclined to drink at that
hour, and expressed myself to that effect. They then
asked me to lend them money to procure it, and they
would repay me on pay-day. I gave them what they
wanted, and I soon had the most of the men in the
room at me on the same errand. In the course of the
day I got my regimentals served out, and was sent
to drill. After drill it was intimated to the recruits
who had lately joined, that they ought to treat the
drill sergeant, by way of propitiating his favour.
While we were talking, the sergeant who had conducted
us to the regiment came up to bid us farewell.

âYou are not going away to-night,â said a recruit.

âI believe I will,â said the sergeant, âunless you
have anything to treat me to.â

âYou ought to give the sergeant a supper,â said a
man who had joined about a month before; âwe gave
our conducting sergeant a supper.â

It was therefore agreed that we could be no worse
than the others, and he was accordingly invited along
with our drill sergeant. When night came, and we
were going into town, it was moved that the sergeants
of our companies ought to be invited also; of course it
was insinuated that we would be no losers by so doing.
When we were all met, between sergeants of companies
and their friends, whom they had taken the liberty to
invite, we were a goodly company.

[Pg 37]

The supper came in, and was done great justice to
by the guests. Next came the drink, and when all
hearts were warmed by the rum punch, numerous
were the protestations of friendship and promises of
favour from the sergeants to the recruits, which were
very soon forgotten. I was sitting next our conducting
sergeant: he seemed very restless, and spoke often to
a very loquacious sergeant who sat near him, who
replied several times that it was too soon yet. At last,
however, when he found we were all pretty mellow,
he rose and commenced his harangue with, âI say,
lads, I daresay you are all very well pleased with
Sergeant Aââ.â This was assented to by all the
recruits. âWell,â said he, âI just wished to inform
you that it is the usual custom for the recruits to give
the sergeant who conducts them a present when they
receive their bounty.â

The acquiescence of all present, showed how well the
sergeant had chosen the time to make his proposition.

âWhat is the usual sum?â said one.

This question was put to our conducting sergeant:
and after some hesitation, he very modestly replied,
âfive shillings each.â

The money was soon collected, and he pocketed it
with great glee.

At a late hour we separated, and got home to our
barrack rooms without disturbance, having previously
had leave from tattoo. Next day I was roused for drill
at daylight; and after coming in, wishing to procure
some breakfast, I was surprised to find my cash
dwindled to a very few shillings. During the day, I
was applied to by some of my comrades for the loan of
more money; but I refused, alleging that I had little
left. I could soon see that this information made a
great impression on them; for the things which they
had formerly been so officious in doing for me were
now left to be done by myself; and amongst all those
who had been so anxious to become my comrades, I
could not find one now that would accept of me, and a
new party of recruits joining I was soon altogether forgot.

[Pg 38]

Next day, having purchased some little things that
I needed, I found my money expended; but I gave
myself little uneasiness about it, as I had lent so much,
and the following day was pay-day. When the men
received their pay, I spoke to those who had borrowed
the money from me, and said that I would be obliged
to them for it; but how was I surprised when some of
them swore I had never lent them a farthing, and
threatened to beat me for presuming to say so! Others
said they could not pay me at that time; and more of
them laughed at my simplicity in expecting repayment
of any money borrowed out of a bounty! This is
strange kind of justice, thought I; and leaving the
room, I wandered down by the sea side, thinking on
the honest men I had got amongst. I heard the step
of some one behind me, and turning round to see who
it was, I perceived one of the recruits who had joined
some time before me. His name was Dennis ââ:
he was an Irishman. I had remarked that he took no
part with the others, in their professions of kindness to
me, and that on the night of the spree he had gone to
bed without joining in it. When he came up to me,
he said, âI have waited until now to speak to you, for
I would not say a word while the bounty lasted, lest
you might suspect that I was like the others; but now
I have come to say that if you choose you can be my
comrade, for mine left me before you came to the room,
to go along with a recruit; and now, that his bounty
is finished, he wishes to come back again; but I hate
such meanness, and would never associate with a fellow
of his description; however, I think you and I will
agree.â I was glad to accept his disinterested offer;
and during all the time that Dennis and I were
comrades, I never had reason to repent it; for he was
of a warm-hearted generous disposition, and never
flinched from me in distress. He had no education:
he could neither read nor write; but he had a judgment,
which no sophistry could blind, and his acute
Hibernian remarks often puzzled men who thought
themselves better informed; besides this, he had a fund
[Pg 39]

of honour that never would allow him to stoop to a
mean action. One fault, indeed, he had in common
with the generality of his countrymen, and that was,
when he got liquor he was a thorough madman.

Dennis and I were now left to ourselves, to act as
we pleased, and the âknowing boysâ looked out for
newer hands to fleece, some of them descending to very
mean stratagems to get drink. I remember being in
town with Dennis one evening, and having gone into
a public-house to get a glass before we went home,
one of those disgraceful animals came into the room
where we were sitting, and after telling some rigmarole
story, without being asked to drink, he lifted the glass
from before us, and having said, âHereâs your health,â
swallowed its contents. I was confounded at his impudence,
and sat staring at him; but Dennis was up
in an instant, and knocked him down, and, as he said
himself, âkicked him for falling.â The fellow never
made any resistance, but gathered himself up, and
crawled out of the room. When he was gone,ââBy my
faith!â said Dennis, âI think I gave the rascal the worth
of his moneyâthat is the only cure for a âspunge.ââ

âI wonder they have no shame,â said I.

âShame!â rejoined Dennis, âshame and they might
be married, for any relationship between them!â

In a short time I began to recover my spirits, and
when I had any spare time, I had recourse to my old
favourites, which I obtained from a circulating library
in the town. It is true I could not now dream so
delectably of the life of a shepherd or a sailor; but I
had the field of honour before me. To fight in defence
of oneâs country, thought Iâto follow the example of
a Bruce or a Wallaceâmust be a glorious thing.
Military fame seemed the only object worth living for.
I already anticipated my acts of valour, charging the
enemy, driving all before me, and coming back loaded
with honour and a stand of French colours; receiving
the praise of my commanding officer, and a commission.
On I went in my career of arms, and it was impossible
to stop short of being a general.

[Pg 40]

In these day-dreams of promotion and honour, I did
not look particularly to the situation I was then in; or
even very attentively at the intermediate ground I had
to go over; but these were trifles in my estimation at
that time. I must confess, however, that a damp was
often thrown over these fine speculations by some harsh
words from the drill sergeant, or some overbearing
conduct of my superiors. Or when I saw a poor fellow
taken out, and receiving a flogging for being ten minutes
late from tattoo, I could not help thinking the road to
preferment rather rough. Be that as it may, I believe
I had by this time caught a portion of military enthusiasm;
and âdeath or gloryâ seemed very fine words,
and often, when walking alone, have I ranted over the
words which Goldsmith puts into the mouth of the
Vicar of Wakefield, when his son leaves him to go into
the army,ââGo, my boy, and if you fall, though
distant, exposed, and unwept by those who love you,
the most precious tears are those with which heaven
bedews the unburied head of the soldier.â

The miserable retreat of our army to Corunna, and
the account given of it by some of those who had returned,
often lowered my too sanguine anticipations;
but nothing could permanently keep down my ever
active imagination. In this state of mind, I felt a
relief from the melancholy I had previously sunk into;
but still I was far from being contented; something
was continually occurring which made me draw comparisons
between my present way of living, and that
which I had enjoyed at home. There were few of
those with whom I could associate, that had an idea
beyond the situation they were in:
[4]
those who had
were afraid to show they possessed any more knowledge
than their comrades, for fear of being laughed at
by fellows who, in other circumstances, they would
have despised. If a man ventured to speak in a style
more refined than the herd around him, he was told
that âEvery one did not read the dictionarâ like him;â
[Pg 41]

or, â Dinna be giâen us ony oâ your grammar words na.â
If a man, when accused by his superiors of something
of which he was not guilty, ventured to speak in his
own defence, he was called a
lawyer
, and desired to
give no reply. If he said that he thought it was
hard that he should be condemned without a
hearing, the answer was, âBe silent, sir!
you have
no right to think
; there are people paid for thinking
for youâdo what you are ordered, sir, right
or wrong,â

If he did not join with his neighbours in their ribald
obscenity and nonsense, he was a Methodist,âif he did
not curse and swear, he was a Quakerâand if he did
not drink the most of his pay, he was called a miser, a
mean scrub, and the generality of his comrades would
join in execrating him.

In such society, it was a hard matter for a man of
any superior information or intellect to keep his
ground; for he had few to converse with on those
subjects which were most congenial to his mind, and
to try to inform his comrades was a vain, and by them
considered a presumptuous attempt. Thus, many men
of ability and information were, I may say, forced from
the intellectual height which they had attained, down
to the level of those with whom they were obliged to
associate; and everything conspired to sink them to
that point where they became best fitted for
tractable
beasts of burden
.

Blackguardism was fashionable, and even the
youngest were led into scenes of low debauchery and
drunkenness, by men advanced in years. Many of
the officers, who, at least,
ought
to have been men of
superior talents and education, seemed to be little
better, if we were allowed to judge from the abominable
oaths and scurrility which they used to those
under their command, and the vexatious and overbearing
tyranny of their conduct, which was too often
imitated by those beneath them.

It redounds much to the honour of those who superintend
the discipline of the army at present, that the
[Pg 42]

situation of the soldier has been much ameliorated
since that period.

Let it not be thought, however, that there were not
many exceptions to this general character which I
have drawn, (some of whom I will have occasion to
mention in this narrative,) who have shed a lustre
around the military character that has often served to
conceal its defects.

FOOTNOTES:

[4]
This is not to be wondered at when we consider how the army
was at that time recruited; it is very different now.

CHAPTER VI.

About the beginning of May, we got the route for
Aberdeen. On the march I have nothing interesting
to take notice of, unless the kindness which we experienced
from the people where we were billeted on the
road, particularly after we crossed the Firth of Forth.

We arrived in Aberdeen, after a march of ten days,
where we had better barracks, and cheaper provisions
than in Dunbar; but the barracks being too small, a
number of our men were billeted in the town, and not
being in the mess when pay-day came, it was a common
thing for many of them to spend what they had
to support them in drink; and some of them were so
infatuated as to sell even their allowance of bread for
the same purpose. They were then obliged (to use
their own phraseology) to âBox Harry,â until the next
pay-day; and some of them carried this system to such
a length, that it was found necessary to bring them
into barracks, to prevent them from starving themselves.

If I may be allowed to draw a conclusion from what
I have seen, the menâs morals are no way improved by
being lodged out of barracks; for, while here, the
principal employment of many of them when off duty
was drinking, and associating with common women;
and I think, if anything tends to depreciate the character
of the soldier in the eyes of his countrymen, in civil
life, more than another, it is this habit of associating
publicly with such characters. This total disregard
[Pg 43]

of even the appearance of decency, conveys an idea to
the mind that he must be the
lowest of the low
. But
many of them seem to be proud of such company; and
it is quite a common thing to meet them on the streets
arm in arm.

This debasement of feeling and character, I imagine,
arises from the system of discipline pursued by many
commanding officers, which teaches the soldier to
believe that he is a mere piece of machinery in the
hands of his superiors, to be moved only as they please
without any accordance of his own reason or judgment,
and that he has no merit in his own actions, independent
of this moving power. Such a belief has naturally
the effect of making a man so little in his own eyes,
that he feels he cannot sink lower, let him keep what
company he may.

But let soldiers be taught that they have a character
to uphold; give them to understand that they are
made of the same materials as those who command
them, capable of feeling sentiments of generosity and
honour; let officers evince by their conduct that they
believe that the men they command have feelings as
well as themselves, (although it would be a hard task
to make some of them think so;) let them be encouraged
to improve their minds, and there will soon be a
change for the better in the armyâone honourable to
all concerned.

The doctrine which teaches that men are most easily
governed when ignorant, is, I believe, now nearly exploded;
and I can say from my own experience, and
also safely appeal to all unprejudiced individuals of the
army, whether they have not found men having some
intellectual cultivation the best soldiers.

We had been about three months in Aberdeen, when
we received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to sail
for Jersey; and four transports having arrived for us,
we prepared to embark.

This was a busy scene. We had been on good terms
with the townspeople, and many of them attended us
to the pier. As we marched down, the old women
[Pg 44]

stood in rows, exclaiming,ââPeer things! they are
gaun awaâ to the slauchter.â While the boys were
ranked up, marching before our band, with as much
importance as if they considered themselves heroes;
and no doubt, the fine music, and the sight of the
soldiers marching to it, gave them high ideas of a
military life; and perhaps, was the incipient cause of
their enlisting at a future period. Indeed, I must
confess that when I heard the crowd cheering, and
our music playing before us, I felt at least a foot
higher, and strutted with as much dignity as if I had
been a general. I almost felt proud at that moment
that I was a soldier.

Once embarked, however, and fairly out to sea, my
enthusiasm soon evaporated. Stowed like any other
part of a cargo, with only eighteen inches allowed for
each man to lie on, we had scarcely room to move.
The most of the men became sea-sick, and it was
almost impossible to be below without becoming so.
The women particularly suffered much; being crammed
in indiscriminately amongst the men, and no arrangement
made for their comfort.

No incident of any consequence took place on this
voyage, with the exception of a severe gale of wind,
which forced us to run into Dungeness; but it soon
abated, and proceeding on our voyage, we made the
island of Jersey, and disembarked at St Obanâs harbour;
from thence we marched through St Helierâs to the
Russian barracks near Groville.

All kinds of liquor, tea, sugar, and fruit, were here
uncommonly cheap; but bread was dear, and what we
had served out as rations was quite black and soft,
something in consistence like clay. Brandy was only
a shilling a bottle; wine, two shillings; cyder, three-halfpence
a quart; and tobacco, fifteen pence a pound.

The jovial drinking fellows amongst us thought this
another paradiseâa heaven on earth; and many of
them laid the foundation of complaints here which they
never got rid of.

It was during the time we were here that the jubilee
[Pg 45]

(on his late Majestyâs entering the fiftieth year of his
reign) was celebrated. We were marched to the
sands between St Helierâs and St Obanâs, where the
whole of the military on the island were assembled.
We were served out with eighteen rounds of blank
cartridge per man, and the
feu-de-joie
was fired from
right to left, and again taken up by the right, thus
keeping up a constant fire until it was all expended.
The artillery, with the various batteries, and shipping
in the harbour, joined in the firing; and altogether
formed an imposing scene.

When we arrived at our barracks, we got a dayâs
pay in advance, and, with great injunctions not to get
drunk and riotous, we were allowed to go and make
ourselves merry until tattoo-beating. Dennis and I
resolved to hold the occasion like the others, although
he said he did not admire this way of âtreating us to
our own.â

We went to one of the usual drinking-houses; but
it was full, up to the door; volumes of tobacco smoke
issued from every opening; and the noise of swearing
and singing was completely deafening.

We were obliged to go farther off to get a house to
sit down in. At last we found a place of that description,
and went in. After a glass or two, we became
quite jovial; and Dennis insisted that our host and his
wife should sit down along with us. He was a Frenchman
and spoke little English; but Dennis did not
mind that, and there soon commenced a most barbarous
jargonâDennis laying off a long story, of
which, I am sure, the poor man did not understand a
syllable. Yet he went on, still saying at the end of
every sentence, âYou take me now?âââYou persave
me now, donât you?â While our host, whose patience
seemed pretty well taxed, would shrug up his shoulders
with a smile, and looking at his wife, who seemed to
understand what was said nearly as well as himself, he
would give a nod and say,

âOui, monsieurâyees, sare,â

Dennis having got tired of talking, asked the landlord
[Pg 46]

if he could sing. This completely puzzled the
Frenchman. At last, after every method had been
tried in vain to make him comprehend, Dennis said,
âYou do this,â and opening his mouth, he howled out
a line of an Irish song. The Frenchman, seemingly
frightened with the noise that Dennis had made,
started to his feet and exclaimed,

âMe no chanter.â

âOch! the devilâs in ye, for a liar, Parly-vu. But
no matter, Iâll give you a songâa true Irish song, my
jewel,â and he commenced with the âSprig of shillelah
and shamrock so green.â He had got as far as âAn
Irishman all in his glory was there,â quivering and
spinning out the last line of the verse to a prodigious
length, when a rap came to the door, and the voice of
the sergeant of the picquet, asking if there were any
soldiers in the house, put an unpleasant end to his
melody. Previous to this, however, Dennis had taken
up a spade handle, to represent the shillelah, and it was
with difficulty that I prevented him from bringing it
down on the sergeantâs head.

We were then escorted to the guard-house, for
being out after tattoo, which we found so full that
we could scarcely get admittance. Dennis cried and
sung by turns, until he fell fast asleep. I was so
stupified with the drink I had taken, that I scarcely
knew how I felt. Next morning, however, we were
released along with all the others who had been confined
the preceding evening.

We had been about three months in Jersey when the
order came for our embarkation for Portugal; but
only six women to every hundred men were allowed to
accompany us. As there were, however, a great many
more than that number, it was ordered that they
should draw lots, to see who should remain. The
women of the company to which I belonged were assembled
in the pay-sergeantâs room for that purpose.
The men of the company had gathered round them, to
see the result, with various degrees of interest depicted
in their countenances. The proportionate number of
[Pg 47]

tickets were made with âto goâ or ânot to goâ written
on them. They were then placed in a hat, and the
women were called by their seniority to draw their
tickets. I looked round me before they began. It
was an interesting scene. The sergeant stood in the
middle with a hat in his hand, the women around him,
with their hearts palpitating, and anxiety and suspense
in every countenance. Here and there you would see
the head of a married man pushed forward, from
amongst the crowd, in the attitude of intense anxiety
and attention.

The first woman called, was the sergeantâs wifeâshe
drew ânot to go.â It seemed to give little concern
to any one, but herself and her husband. She was not
very well liked in the company. The next was a
corporalâs wifeâshe drew âto go.â This was received
by all with nearly as much apathy as the first. She
was little beloved either.

The next was an old hand, a most outrageous virago,
who thought nothing of giving her husband a knock
down when he offended her, and who used to make
great disturbance about the fire in the cooking way.
Every one uttered their wishes audibly that she would
lose: and her husband, if we could judge from his
countenance, seemed to wish so too. She boldly
plunged her hand into the hat, and drew out a ticket;
and opening it, she held it up triumphantly, and displayed
âto go.â âHurra,â said she, âold Meg will go
yet, and live to scald more of you about the fireside.â
A general murmur of disappointment ran through the
whole.

âHang the old wretch!â said some of them, âshe
has the devilâs luck and her own.â

The next in turn was the wife of a young man, who
was much respected in the company for his steadiness
and good behaviour. She was remarkable for her
affection for her husband, and beloved by the whole
company for her modest and obliging disposition. She
advanced with a palpitating heart and trembling hand,
to decide on (what was to her, I believe) her future
[Pg 48]

happiness or misery. Every one prayed for her success.
Trembling between fear and hope she drew out one of
the tickets, and attempted to open it: but her hand
shook so that she could not do it. She handed it to
one of the men to open.âWhen he opened it, his
countenance fell, and he hesitated to say what it was.
She cried out to him, in a tone of agony, âTell me, for
Godâs sake, what it is.â

âNot to go,â said he in a compassionate tone of voice.

âOh, God, help me! O Sandy!â she exclaimed, and
sunk lifeless in the arms of her husband, who had
sprung forward to her assistance, and in whose face
was now depicted every variety of wretchedness. The
drawing was interrupted, and she was carried by her
husband to his berth, where he hung over her in frantic
agony. By the assistance of those around her, she was
soon recovered from her swoon; but she awoke only
to a sense of her misery. The first thing she did was
to look round for her husband, when she perceived him
she seized his hand, and held it, as if she was afraid
that he was going to leave her. âO, Sandy, youâll no
leave me and your poor babie, will you?â The poor
fellow looked in her face with a look of agony and
despair.

The scene drew tears from every eye in the room
with the exception of the termagant whom I have
already mentioned, who said, âWhat are ye aâ makinâ
sic a wark about? let the babie get her greet out. I
suppose she thinks thereâs naebody ever parted with
their men but her, wiâ her faintinâ, and her airs, and her
wark.â

âOh, youâre an oul hard-hearted devil,â said Dennis,
âan unfeeling oul hag, and the devil âill never get his
due till he gets you;ââand he took her by the shoulders
and pushed her out of the room. She would have
turned on Dennis; but she had got a squeeze from him
on a former occasion, and I daresay she did not like to
run the risk of another.

The drawing was again commenced, and various
were the expressions of feeling evinced by those concerned.
[Pg 49]

The Irish women, in particular, were loud
in their grief. It always appeared to me that the Irish
either feel more acutely than the Scotch or English, or
that they have less restraint on themselves in expressing
it. The barrack, through the rest of that day, was one
continued scene of lamentation.

I was particularly interested in the fate of Sandy and
his wife. I wished to administer consolation; but
what could I say? There was no comfort that I could
give, unless leading her to hope that we would soon
return. âOh, no,â said she, âwhen we part here, I am
sure that weâll never meet again in this world!â

We were to march the next morning early. The
most of the single men were away drinking. I slept
in the berth above Sandy and his wife. They never
went to bed, but sat the whole night in their berth, with
their only child between them, alternately embracing
it and each other, and lamenting their cruel fortune.
I never witnessed in my life such a heart-rending scene.
The poor fellow tried to assume some firmness; but in
vain; some feeling expression from her would throw
him off his guard, and at last his grief became quite
uncontrollable.

When the first bugle sounded, he got up and prepared
his things. Here a new source of grief sprung
up. In laying aside the articles which he intended to
leave, and which they had used together, the idea
seemed fixed in her mind, that they would never use
them in that way again; and as she put them aside,
she watered them with her tears. Her tea-pot, her cups,
and every thing that they had used in commonâall
had their apostrophe of sorrow. He tried to persuade
her to remain in the barrack, as we had six miles to
travel to the place of embarkation; but she said she
would take the last minute in his company that she
could.

The regiment fell in, and marched off, amid the
wailing of those who, having two or three children,
could not accompany us to the place of embarkation.
Many of the men had got so much intoxicated that
[Pg 50]

they were scarcely able to walk, and the commanding
officer was so displeased with their conduct, that in
coming through St Helierâs, he would not allow the
band to play.

When we arrived at the place where we were to
embark, a most distressing scene took place, in the men
parting with their wives. Some of them, indeed, it did
not appear to affect much; others had got themselves
nearly tipsy; but the most of them seemed to feel
acutely. When Sandyâs wife came to take her last
farewell, she lost all government of her grief. She
clung to him with a despairing hold. âOh, dinna,
dinna leave me!â she cried. The vessel was hauling
out. One of the sergeants came to tell her that she
would have to go ashore. âOh, theyâll never be so
hard-hearted as to part us!â said she; and running aft
to the quarter-deck, where the commanding officer was
standing, she sunk down on her knees, with her child
in her arms. âOh! will you no let me gang wiâ my
husband? Will you tear him frae his wife and his
wean? He has nae frienâs but usânor we ony but
himâand oh! will ye makâ us aâ frienâless? See my
wee babie pleadinâ for us.â

The officer felt a painful struggle between his duty
and his feelings; the tears came into his eyes. She
eagerly caught at this as favourable to her cause, âOh
ay, I see you have a feeling heartâyouâll let me gang
wiâ him. You have nae wife; but if you had, I am
sure you wad think it unco hard to be torn frae her
this wayâand this wee darlinâ.â

âMy good woman,â said the officer, âI feel for you
much; but my orders are peremptory, that no more
than six women to each hundred men go with their
husbands. You have had your chance as well as the
other women; and although it is hard enough on you
to be separated from your husband, yet there are many
more in the same predicament; and it is totally out of
my power to help it.â

âWell, well,â said she, rising from her knees, and
straining her infant to her breast: âItâs aâ owre wiâ us,
[Pg 51]

my puir babie; this day leaves us friendless on the wide
world.â

âGod will be your friend,â said I, as I took the
child from her until she would get into the boat. Sandy
had stood like a person bewildered all this time, without
saying a word.

âFarewell, then, a last farewell, then,â said she to him,
âWhereâs my babie?â I handed him to herââGive
him a last kiss, Sandy.â He pressed the infant to his
bosom in silent agony, âNow, aâs owre; farewell Sandy,
weâll maybe meet in heaven;â and she stepped into
the boat with a wild despairing look. The vessel
was now turning the pier, and she was almost out
of our sight in an instant; but as we got the last
glimpse of her, she uttered a shriek, the knell of
a broken heart, which rings in my ears at this moment.
Sandy rushed down below, and threw himself into
one of the berths, in a state of feeling which defies
description. Poor fellow, his wifeâs forebodings were
too true! What became of her I have never been
able to learn.

Nothing occurred worthy of remark on our voyage
from Jersey to Lisbon. When we made the mouth of
the Tagus, we got a Portuguese pilot on board. He
had scarcely reached the gang-way when he was surrounded
by all the men on deck; for his appearance
was grotesque in the extreme. He was about four feet
and a half high, and had on a jacket and breeches of
what would have puzzled a philosopher to tell the
original; for patches of red, yellow, blue, &c., were
mingled through the whole dress, without any regularity.
A pair of red stockings, and an enormous cocked hat,
completed his costume. His complexion was of the
same hue as a well-smoked bacon ham; and the whole
contour of his face bore a striking resemblance to the
ape tribe. âBlessings on your purty face, my honey,â
said Dennis, as he eyed him narrowly, âyou have made
your escape from some showman. May I never sin, if
I donât think I have seen you tumbling on a rope at
Donnybrook fair.â Our hero passed on, taking no
[Pg 52]

notice of the compliment Dennis had paid him, to take
the helm from the seaman on duty; but the tar, giving
him a contemptuous look, called out to the captain,
âWill I give the helm to this here
thing
?â

âCertainly,â said the captain, laughing. The sailor,
however, did not seem sure about him; and as he
passed on to the forecastle, could not help throwing a
doubtful look behind at his
substitute
. He proved to
be a good pilot, however, and managed the vessel
well.

We passed Fort St Julian, and sailed up the Tagus
as far as Belem, where our pilot gave the order to âlet
go de ank.â The attention of those on deck was soon
drawn towards a number of people who were sitting in
a row, beneath the walls of a large building, seemingly
very busy at something. After watching their motions
for some time, we discovered that they were picking
the vermin off themselves! There was none of that

modest pressing
between the finger and thumb, for fear
of being seen, which we may observe in our dirty and
indigent neighbours at home. It was absolute open
murder! in all its varieties; and truly they had their
hands full of work; for although we looked at them for
a length of time, the carnage still continued as fierce as
ever. It appeared to me that a new breed sprung,
Phoenix-like, from the remains of their predecessors.
This is a
biting
sample of Portugal, thought I, turning
away in disgust from the scene; but I soon got accustomed
to it; for in Spain and Portugal, the latter
particularly, the
peocha
seems quite at home, not
confined to the poor alone; for I have seen the family
of a rich fidalgo, male and female, assembled on the
sunny side of the house, â
sharp shooting
â publicly,
without seeming to feel any shame.

So far from that, it appeared to be the most interesting
of their forenoon amusements.

Next morning we disembarked and marched up
to St Domingo convent, part of which had been converted
into barracks. In the course of the day Dennis
and I got into the town. We promised ourselves much
[Pg 53]

from the view we had had from the river the preceding
evening; but were miserably disappointed when we
got into the streets; for mountains of filth were collected
in them, so that we could scarcely pass; and
the smell of oil and garlic issuing from the shops was
quite sickening. The most of the streets were very
narrow.

The population seemed composed of monks and
friars, for we met them at every step either begging,
or walking in procession with the sacrament (or host)
to some sick person. On these occasions they were
preceded by a bell, which warned the passengers of
their approach; whenever it was heard, they were
down on their knees in a moment, in the very middle of
the mud, and continued praying and beating their
breasts until it passed. Poor Dennis was sadly puzzled
the first time he met one of these parties; he was a
Catholic, and of course could not avoid following the
example of the
Christianos
around him; but he had a
great aversion to kneeling in the dirty streets. The
procession was fast advancing, and he had been two
or three times half down on his knees and up again;
at last a lucky thought struck himâhe snatched the
hat out of the hand of a Portuguese who was kneeling
before him, and deliberately placing it on the ground,
kneeled down on it, and went through the ceremony
with great gravityâthus saving both his conscience
and his breeches. The fellow who owned the hat
durst not move until the procession had passed; and
then, without giving him time to speak, Dennis clapped
the hat, dirty as it was, on the ownerâs head, and
walked off.

The fruit market was opposite to the convent gate;
and it certainly was to us a novel and a pleasing sight.
The finest fruits, which at home were rare and high in
price, we found here as plenty and as cheap as gooseberries.
Pine apples, peaches, and grapes, of the
largest size and most exquisite flavour, with oranges,
lemons, and pomegranates, were arranged on the
standings, in the most tempting and tasteful manner.
[Pg 54]

Dennis and I walked through amongst them with a
strong desire of tasting them, yet fearful that our
finances would not enable us to buy any. I ventured,
however, to ask for the worth of a vintin (about three
halfpence English) of oranges; after giving the woman
the money, and pointing to the fruit, I held out my
hand to receive them, but she beckoned me to give her
my hat, and to our surprise, she nearly filled it.

The fragrant and delicious odour which perfumed
the market place, and the sight of the beautiful fruit
and flowers, made it a much more attractive place of
resort, than the dirty streets filled with the abominable
stench which issued from their cook-shops. My
opinion of the interior of Lisbon was certainly very low;
and I think, if a stranger wishes to see Lisbon, and
leave it with any idea of its grandeur, he ought to
contemplate it from the river, but never set his foot on
shore, for he will then feel nothing but disgust.

CHAPTER VII.

We remained only seven days in Lisbon; on the
evening of the seventh we were turned out, marched
down to Belem, and embarked by torch light for Cadiz.
I do not remember anything worthy of notice which
took place on this voyage, only that it was tedious.

When we made the bay of Cadiz, we found a large
fleet of British vessels there before us. The French
had possession of all the surrounding country, with the
exception of the Isle of Leon and Cadiz; and these
were closely besieged. When we first arrived, we were
not sure on which side of the bay we might be required
to land; but we were served out with flints and
ammunition, and our commanding officer issued a
circular to the men on board the different transports,
ordering us to hold ourselves in readiness for immediate
action, and exhorting us to remember the honour of
our country and regiment.

That evening, our light company, with those of the
[Pg 55]

other regiments, forming a light brigade, under the
command of Major-General the Hon. Sir William
Stewart, landed and marched to the outpost at the
town of Isla. Next day the remainder of the troops
disembarked; and entering Cadiz, we occupied part
of the bomb-proof barracks under the ramparts, where
we remained with Lieutenant-General Graham, who
was chief in command.

I could not say that our reception by the inhabitants,
on landing, was very flattering. Here and there
amongst the crowd, you could hear a âViva Englese;â
but the greater number received us with a gloomy
suspicious silence. Setting aside other causes, it was
really not to be wondered at, that the inhabitants should
feel little attachment to the English, when we consider
that they had suffered so severely by Nelson and the
British fleet, about four years before, and that the
shattered remains of some of their vessels were still
lying in the bay.

Cadiz was, in my opinion, a much cleaner town than
Lisbon, and in point of situation, more picturesque.
From the ramparts on the Atlantic side of the town,
the view was very fine; to the left, we could see the
African shore, with its mountains stretching out until
their outline was lost in the distance. Before you the
prospect was unconfined, and the eye was lost in the
wide world of waters, unless when it was arrested by a
passing sail, or brought nearer the town by the noise of
the breakers lashing the dark sides of the rocks, which
ran out into the sea, and here and there showed their
heads above water. On the side of the town next the
bay, the Rota, Bay of Bulls, with the town of Port
St Maryâs, Porto Real, Isla, Checuelina, and Cape
Trafalgar, brought the eye round to where it set
out.

When we had anything to wash, we were obliged to
go outside the walls to some of the cisterns, a short
distance from the town. It was here I first learned to
wash my own clothes. I was awkward enough when
I began, but practice soon made me expert at it.

[Pg 56]

In one of these washing excursions, I happened to
pass a chapel; and seeing people engaged at some ceremony
in it, my curiosity prompted me to enter. A
corpse lay on a bier, with the face uncovered, and a
bunch of flowers were placed in its hands, which were
joined together in a praying attitude. The priest was
performing the service of the dead over it; near him
stood two little boys, with silver censers waving in their
hands, filled with burning incense. The whole service
seemed to me impressive enough. After it was finished,
the corpse was removed to the outside of the chapel,
and deposited in a hole in the wall resembling an oven;
it was then covered with quick lime; the mouth of the
hole shut up with a stone, which fitted it; and the
people retired.

As yet, none of the troops had been brought into
action, with the exception of the light companies, who
had some slight skirmishing at the outposts. The
French had attempted nothing of any consequence.
They were very busy, however, prosecuting the siegeâbuilding
batteries in every direction. There was one
battery, called Fort M ââ. It lay on the French
side, at the extremity of a point of land, stretching
down from Porto Real into the bay, opposite to Puntallis.
From this, had they manned it, they might have
annoyed our shipping very much; and it was resolved
that we should take possession of it.

Accordingly, one evening the three first men from
each company of the regiment to which I belonged were
turned out, in marching order, for that purpose. At
the quay, we were joined by a detachment of artillery,
and were conveyed across the bay in man-of-war boats.
On our passage we were joined by a party of seamen
and marines; who, with a captain-commandant, surgeon,
two subalterns, one of whom acted as adjutant, a
lieutenant of artillery, and a midshipman, made in all
about one hundred and fifty men.

When we reached the fort, we used every precaution
to avoid alarming the French if there had been any
there; but it was quite unnecessary, for their picquet
[Pg 57]

had retired, without firing a shot. After placing a
picquet in front, we set to work, and got up three guns,
which we had brought with us. This kept us busy
enough until morning; when we got a better view of
the isolated place we had taken possession of. The
fort itself was about a hundred yards square; but it had
been completely demolished on its sea face, by the seamen
of our fleet when the French advanced to the
siege, and the others were all more or less in ruins.
The bomb-proofs were nearly all destroyed. In what
remained there was not shelter for the half of our men;
and by a rule of division, often practised in the army,
that little was made less by the officers appropriating
the half of it to themselves.

Day had not long dawned when the French gave us
a salute from a small battery, in the village at Fort
Lewis; but when we got our guns mounted, it was
soon silenced. From that time we commenced with
redoubled exertion to work at the batteryâbuilding up
the parapets, and laying platforms for more guns. We
were supplied with materials, viz., fascions, gabions,
and sand-bags, from Cadiz.

Here we were wrought like slaves, I may say,
without intermission; for our worthy adjutant, who
aimed at being a rigid disciplinarian, and was a great
amateur in drill, was determined that no hard labour,
or want of convenience for cleaning our things, should
tempt him to deviate from a clean parade and formal
guard-mounting every morning, even although we had
been out all night under the rain on picquet, or carrying
sand-bags and digging trenches up to the knees in mud.
All the varied forms of duty known in a militia regiment,
with which he was best acquainted, were by
him indispensable; and in a place where we had no
convenience for keeping our things in order, not even
shelter for them, this exactness was certainly, to say the
least of it, unnecessarily teasing. We were also obliged
to stand sentry on different parts of the battery, full
dressed, where there was no earthly use for us, unless
for show; and I could perceive no reason the commandant
[Pg 58]

and he had for their conduct, unless that,
feeling the novelty of their situationâin command of a
fortâthey wished to ape, with their handful of men,
all the importance of leaders of an army.

We were driven from guard to workingâworking
to picquetâpicquet to working again, in a gin-horse
round of the most intolerable fatigue; which we never
could have borne for any length of time, exposed as we
often were to sun and rain, in a climate like that of
Cadiz. But, even with all this we had the mortification
to find our best endeavours repaid with the most
supercilious haughtiness, and the worst of usage. We
were allowed little time to sleep; and that little often
interrupted.

But let it not be imagined that our officers participated
in all this fatigue; they know how to take care
of themselves; and they could sit and drink wine in
their bomb-proof at night, as comfortably as in a mess
room at home. And it was a common amusement of
the commandant, when he got warmed with it, to order
the drum to beat to arms in the middle of the nightâwhen
the poor wretches who had perhaps just lost sense
of their fatigue in sweet oblivion, would be roused up,
and obliged to go to their several posts on the ramparts;
and when permitted to go below to our berths, we would
scarcely be lain down, when we were again roused to
commence working. This was the usual routine the
most of the time we were here.

It may be well to remark, however, (for the benefit
of those officers who may wish to follow the example,)
that the commandant had a most
ingenious
method of
assembling his men quickly; he used to stand with his
fist clenched, at the top of the ladder leading from the
bomb-proof, ready to knock down the last man that
came up; and as some one must necessarily be last, he
of course was sure of the blow; and as he was a strong
muscular man, it used to
tell
(as we military men term
it) on the poor fellowâs head.

One man, I remember, who had suffered in this way,
remonstrated, and threatened to complain to his
[Pg 59]

colonel; but the answer was a second âknock down,â
and an order to confine him between two guns in an
angle of the battery, where he was exposed to the
inclemency of the weather for many days and nights
without covering; and when his health was impaired
by this usage, he was still kept in the fort, although it
was the usual practice to send the sick to the general
hospital in Cadiz. He was not allowed to leave the
place until we all left it; and then it is probable if he
had ventured to complain, he might have been flogged
in addition to all he had suffered, for presuming to say
anything against the Hero of Mââ.

We had now got up six guns and two mortars on the
fort, which was all we could mount to have any effect.
We were supported by a Spanish man-of-war and six
or eight gun-boats; and with them we used to bombard
the small village at Fort Lewis, and annoy the working
parties coming down from Porto Real to build batteries.
We often made great havoc amongst them,
with spherical case-shot. One day in particular, I
remember, we brought down an officer who was riding
on a white horse at the head of his party, and we saw
them carry him off in a litter from the place where he fell.

About this time a severe gale came on, by which a
great number of vessels were stranded on the French
side of the bay; most of them were abandoned by their
crews, who got safe over to Cadiz; but one transport
containing the flank companies and staff of a battalion
of the fourth regiment, ran ashore near Port St Maryâs,
and they were all taken prisoners. They had their
colours with them, and I heard afterwards that they
had put them under the coppers and burned them,
rather than let them fall into the hands of the enemy.
Many of these vessels were richly laden; and as they
were sure ultimately to fall into the hands of the enemy,
being also considered fair prizes when they ran ashore
on an enemyâs coast, we procured a couple of boats, and
succeeded in securing part of the cargo of those nearest
us, which was principally silk, with some pipes of wine
and salt provision.

[Pg 60]

The stranded vessels, that lay along the shore, were
often visited by straggling parties of the French, who
used to carry off heavy burdens of the cargo. This
stimulated some of our men to follow their example;
but there was great risk in the adventure. They
could only go at night, and run all hazard of their
absence being discovered; that, however, might be
averted by the sergeants, who of course shared in the
booty; but the marsh which they had to cross was
very dangerous, the road uncertain, and they might have
been taken by the enemyâs picquets; but notwithstanding
these obstacles, there were many who, either
out of a spirit of adventure, or a love of gain, despised
them all, and were well repaid for their trouble by the
valuable articles which they found.

Our party often fell in with the French stragglers,
who were there on the same errand; but they were
quite friendly, and when any wine or spirits were got
in the vessels, they used to sit down and drink together,
as sociably as if they had been comrades for years.
What every man got was his own, and there was
seldom any dissension.

One night I happened to be of the party. We had
made our burdens, parted with our French friends, and
left the vessels on our way to the fort. The party of
the French had left it also. We had not proceeded far,
when we missed one of our comrades; and fearing that
some accident had befallen him, we returned, and near
the vessel saw him struggling with some one. We
hastened up to him; but before we reached the spot,
the person with whom he was engaged fell to the ground
with a groan. At that moment, we saw our comrade
stoop, and tear something from him. âWhat is the
matter?â said one of our party. âCome away,â said
he, âand Iâll tell you as we go along;â and he passed
us on his way to the fort.

We were anxious to see who his antagonist was; and
on raising him up, we found that he was one of the
French party, who had been with us in the vessel. He
had been stabbed in the left side with a Spanish knife,
[Pg 61]

which still remained in the wound. One of the party
withdrew it. The blood flowed out of the wound with
great force. The poor Frenchman gave a deep groanâa
convulsive quiverâand expired.

âThis is a horrid cold-blooded murder,â said I.
âWhere is Sââ?â At this moment we heard the
noise of footsteps approaching, and thinking it might
be the comrades of the Frenchman who had been
barbarously assassinated, we left the place precipitately,
our minds filled with horror at the savage deed.

On our way to the fort we overtook Sââ; but
none of us spoke to him. He, however, strove to
extenuate his conduct, by saying that he observed the
Frenchman find a purse in a chest that he had broken
open, and seeing him linger behind his party for the
purpose of secreting it about his person, he went up to
him, and asked a share of it. The man refusing this,
a scuffle ensued, and he stabbed him in his own defence,
the Frenchman having attempted to stab him. We
knew this to be false; for the Frenchman had no
weapon in his hand, or near him; and we had no
doubt, from what we knew of Sâââs character, that
he had perpetrated the murder for the sake of the
money, which was gold doubloons. He offered to
share it with us; but not one of us would touch it;
and from that time forward, he was shunned and
detested by all who knew of the murder. He never
prospered after. I even thought that his countenance
acquired a demon-like expression, that rendered it
repulsive; and we had not been long in Portugal,
when he went to the rear and died in great misery.
After that we never returned to the vessels.

The Spaniards had a number of hulks moored in
the bay which Lord Nelson made for them, on board
of which they kept their French prisoners, who, we
understood, were very ill used, nearly starved, and
huddled together in such a way that disease was the
consequence. Many of them died daily. They were
kept until sunset, and then thrown over board, and
allowed to float about in the bay. Every tide threw
[Pg 62]

some of them ashore, and the beach was continually
studded here and there with them. When our men
discovered any of them, they scraped a hole in the sand,
and buried them; but they were totally unheeded by
the Spaniards unless when they practised some barbarity
on themâsuch as dashing large stones on their
heads, or cutting and mutilating them in such a way
that the very soul would sicken at the idea.

I was one night on picquet, and along with the
sergeant reconnoitering the ground in front of the fort,
as the French picquets were in the habit of coming
close down on us when it was dark. We saw something
white moving amongst the weeds near the shore,
to the left of the battery; and we went down in that
direction to see what it was; but in an instant we lost
sight of it. When we came to the place where we
first saw it, we found the body of a man extended on
the ground. This was not an uncommon appearance;
but as we had seen something moving when we were
first attracted to the spot, I was induced to feel the
body, to ascertain whether it was dead, and to my
surprise, I found him warm, and assisted by the
sergeant raised him up. It struck us that he had only
fainted, and we rubbed him for some time with our
hands. He at last began to recover, and his first
action, when he came to himself, was to fall down on
his knees at our feet, and cry âMisericordia.â
[5]
We
did not understand what he said; but we asked him, in
English, how he had come there. Whenever he heard
us speak, he sprung to his feet, and seizing our hands,
he cried âVous etes AngloisâGrÃ¢ce Ã  bon Dieu!â
[6]

We threw a great-coat over him, and took him into
the fort, where, placing him before a fire, and giving
him some bread and wine, the poor fellow soon recovered.
When it was discovered that he had no clothes
on, one man took off his shirt and put it on him,
another gave him a pair of trousers, and he was soon
comfortably clothed. He poured out his thanks in
French, but he saw we did not understand the language.
[Pg 63]

He tried the Spanish with like success. He attempted
a mixture of both with as little effect; but when he
pressed his hand on his heart, and the big drop
gathered in his eye, he found by the sympathising
tear which it excited, that no words were necessary to
express the universal language of gratitude.

When he was perfectly recovered, we reported the
affair to the commandant, and the artillery officer
speaking the French language, he was questioned by
him. In reply, he said he was a surgeon in the French
service; that he had been taken prisoner and confined
on board one of the prison ships; that that night he
determined to make his escape, or perish in the
attempt; and having lowered himself down from one
of the gun ports, quite naked, he had swam a distance
of two miles; but was so exhausted when he reached
the shore, that he sank down insensible at the time we
had first seen him; when he recovered, his first idea
was that he had fallen into the hands of the Spaniards,
who, he well knew, would have butchered him without
mercy; but when he found by our language that we
were English, he was overjoyed. He had saved
nothing but a miniature of a female, which hung round
his neck, and which he seemed to prize very much, for
when he recovered, the first thing he did was to feel
if it were still there, and raise it to his lips and kiss it.

He was kept until next day in the fort, when he
was sent over to Cadiz. He seemed distracted at the
idea of going there, lest he should be delivered over to
the Spaniards; and although he was assured to the
contrary, still he seemed to feel uneasy.

It was not many days, however, after that, when he
was sent back, with orders that he should be escorted
to our outposts at night, and left to join his countrymen.
When night came, he took leave of the men in the fort
with a kind of regret. I again happened to be of the
party who escorted him. After leaving our picquet,
the sergeant and I conducted him up the path-way
leading direct from the fort, until we suspected that we
were near the French picquet, and there we told him
[Pg 64]

that we would be obliged to leave him. He pressed
our hands in silence: his heart was too full to speak;
but we could easily guess what were his emotions.
Joy at the idea of again rejoining his countrymen, with
a feeling of regret at parting with those to whom he
considered he owed his life, were contending in his
mind.

The night was dark, and we soon lost sight of him;
but we lay down on the ground, and listened with
anxious suspense, afraid that the French outpost sentry
might fire upon him before he had time to explain, and
he might thus lose his life on the very threshold of
freedom; but we did not hear the sentinel challenge
him, nor did we hear any shot fired. We had therefore
every reason to believe he reached his countrymen in
safety.

During the time we were here, an attack was meditated
on the French positions, and a number of troops
were landed on the fort for that purpose. A strong
party of seamen was also landed at fort Catalina, who
succeeded in storming it, and spiking the guns; but in
consequence of some signals being thrown up by
adherents of the French in Cadiz, they were alarmed,
and the troops were obliged to return without effecting
what had been originally intended.

CHAPTER VIII.

We had now been in the fort about two months; and
from the time that we had silenced the small battery
that had opened on us, when we first gained possession
of the place, the French had not molested us, although
they occasionally fired shots at the boats passing up
and down the bay. We were well aware, however,
that this was only a deceitful calm before a storm; for
they had been busy all this time building batteries
both in front and to our right in the village I have
already mentioned, although they were hidden from
our view by the houses.

[Pg 65]

At last, when every thing was prepared, they commenced
their operations one night by blowing up the
houses which had hitherto masked the batteries. I
was out on picquet at the time; and we perceived
them moving round a large fire which they had
kindled. We suspected that they designed to attack us,
and our suspicions were soon verified; for in a short
time after, they gave a salute of grape shot, which
ploughed the earth on every side of us; but this was
only a prelude. A volley of red-hot shot, at the
Spanish man-of-war, succeeded, which set her on fire,
and obliged her to slip her cable, and drop down the
bay. A volley or two more of the same kind scattered
our gun-boats; and we were then left to bear the
brunt of the battle alone. Now it began in earnest.
Five or six batteries, mounting in all about twenty
guns, and eight or ten mortars, opened their tremendous
mouths, vomiting forth death and destruction. The
picquet was called in.

There was a number of spare fascions piled up on
the sea face of the battery, amongst which, for want
of room in the bomb-proof, we formed huts. In one
of these I lodged. They had been set on fire by a
shell that fell amongst them; and when I entered the
fort, the Spanish labourers were busy throwing them
into the sea. I ran to try to save my knapsack, with
the little treasure which I had gained; but it was too
lateâhut and all had been tossed over. There was
no help for it: I did not know how soon I might be
thrown over also. I was called to my gun, and had no
more time to think on the subject. They were now
plying us so fast with shell, that I saw six or eight in
the air over us at once.

Death now began to stalk about in the most dreadful
form. The large shot were certain messengers where
they struck. The first man killed was a sailor who
belonged to the Temeraire seventy-four. The whole
of his face was carried away. It was a horrid-looking
wound. He was at the same gun with me. âAh!
what will we do with him?â said I to a seaman next me.

[Pg 66]

âLet him lie there,â was the reply. âWe have no
time to look after dead men now.â

At that time I thought it a hardened expression;
but this was my first engagement. Not so with the
tar. He had been well used to them.

The French soon acquired a fatal precision with
their shot, sending them in through our embrasures,
killing and wounding men every volley. I was on the
left of the gun, at the front wheel. We were running
her up after loading. I had stooped to take a fresh
purchase, a cannon ball whistled in through the embrasure,
carried the forage cap off my head, and struck
the man behind me on the breast, and he fell to rise
no more.

The commandant was now moving from place to
place, giving orders and exposing himself to every
danger. No one could doubt that he was brave: had
it been bravery, softened and blended with the finer
feelings of humanity, he would have been a true hero;
butââ. Our artillery officer behaved like a gentleman,
as he had always done; and our subaltern in a
tolerable medium: the midshipman in the style of a
brave, rough and ready seaman. But, alas, how had
the mighty fallen!âour brave adjutant, whose blustering
voice, and bullying important manner, had been
always so remarkable, was now as quiet as a lamb.
Seated in an angle of the battery, sheltered from the
shot, no penitent on the
cutty stool
ever exhibited so
rueful a countenance.

The carnage now became dreadful; the ramparts
were strewed with the dead and wounded; and blood,
brains, and mangled limbs, lay scattered in every
direction: but our menâs spirits and enthusiasm seemed
to rise with the danger. The artillery officer stood on
the platform, and when he reported any of our shot
taking effect, a cheer followed, and âAt it again, my
heroes!â was the exclamation from every mouth.
When any of our comrades fell, it excited no visible
feeling but revenge. âNow for a retaliating shot!â
was the word; every nerve was strained to lay the
[Pg 67]

gun with precision; and if it took effect, it was considered
that full justice was done to their memory.

We had a traversing gun in the angle of the battery
which had done great execution. The artillery sergeant
commanded her; and they were plying her with great
vigour. In the course of the day, however, as the man
was returning the sponge after a shot, and the cartridge
in the hand of another, ready to reload, a thirty-two
pound shot from the French entered her muzzle, she
rebounded, and struck the sergeant with her breach on
the breast, and knocked him over insensible. The shot
had entered so far that she was rendered useless, and
abandoned.

The action was kept up the whole of that day, during
which we lost the best and bravest of our men. Our
guns had been well directed at first; but towards
evening, the most of the artillery who had commanded
them were either killed or wounded; and the direction
of them was then taken by men who knew little about
it. The consequence was that much ammunition was
used to little purpose. The artillery soldier at the gun
next to me was killed, and two men equally ambitious
for what they considered the post of honour, quarrelled
about it. From high words it came to blows; but the
dispute was soon settled; for a shell, falling between
them, burst, and quieted them for ever.

I could scarcely define my feelings during the action;
but so far from feeling fear, when it first commenced,
and the silent gloom of the night was broken by the
rapid flash, and the reverberating thunder of the cannon,
I felt a sensation something resembling delight; but it
was of an awful kindâenthusiasm and sublimity, mixed
with a sense of dangerâsomething like what I have felt
in a violent thunder storm.

The firing, on both sides, had been kept up without
intermission from two oâclock in the morning; but as
it now became dark, it was partially suspended. I
then, for the first time, ventured to go below to the
bomb-proof. The scene there was dismalâthe
wounded filled the whole place, and the doctor had not
[Pg 68]

got through with the dressing of them. In this he
was materially assisted from the commencement of the
action by a female, (Mrs Reston,) whose heroism I have
described in a subsequent volume. It is matter of
surprise to many, that the courage she displayed, and
the services she rendered on that occasion, should have
been entirely overlooked by those who had the power
of rewarding her, or that her claims on the country
were not more warmly seconded by the officer who
commanded in the fort.

Here let me pause in my narrative, to pay a tribute
of respect to the memory of assistant-surgeon Bennet,
who was with us during that trying period. To a fair
knowledge of his profession, he added one of the
kindest dispositions I ever knew any one possessed of;
he was absolutely without one drop of gall in his composition;
so much so, indeed, that some of the officers
endeavoured to make him a butt for their raillery, but
his native wit defeated their purpose, and turned
against them their own weapons. Those who have
been under his care will remember him with grateful
feelings. But his career was brief; shortly after our
arrival in Portugal, he caught infection from some of
the sick whom he was attending, and died.

During the day I had little time to reflect on anythingâall
was noise and bustle; but now that I had
time to look round, and saw the ramparts covered with
the pale and disfigured corpses of those who, a few hours
before, were rioting in the fulness of health and strength,
and others writhing in agony, under the severe wounds
they had received, I could not deny that I felt my heart
sink within me, and sensations of a melancholy and
solemn nature took place of those which had before
excited my mind.

When daylight came in next morning, the firing
again commenced as warmly as the preceding day;
and the precision the French had attained with their
shot was very remarkable. We had a flag-staff of the
usual size, on which was hoisted the Spanish colours.
They had cut it across with a cannon ball, it was
[Pg 69]

repaired, and again replaced; but it was not five
minutes up, when another shot brought it down again.
This occurring four or five times successively, gave
great offence to the sailors, who attributed all that we
had suffered to fighting under the Spanish flag, and
swore that if the union jack were up in its place, the
French would not bring it down so easily.

âThereâs that bloody Spanish flag down again,â said
one of the tars.

âLook ye, Jack! I have got our boatâs ensign hereâlet
me go, and Iâll soon run it up.â

He went, and assisted in repairing the flag staff;
but instead of again bending the Spanish flag to the
halliards, he put the English in place of it.

A general huzza greeted its appearance. âNow,
hang it! weâll beat the French dogs,â said the seamen;
but the cheering attracted the notice of the commandant,
and he ordered it to be hauled down again. Never
was an order so reluctantly obeyed. In a few minutes,
a shot cut through the flag staff. âThere it goes down
againâOh, botheration;â was the surly reply. âLet
it lie there;â and there it lay, for no one would meddle
with it. âBetter to fight without a flag at all, than
under such a bloody treacherous flag as that,â said an
old sailor. âI never could bear it, unless when I saw
it flying at the mast head of an enemy.â

By this time three of our guns were rendered unfit
for service, and they had made great impression on
our parapet, with a breach in the end of the bomb-proof.
A corporal of our grenadier company had gone
below to get some refreshment, and was raising a tin
with some wine in it to his mouth, when a shot entered
the breach, and striking some small arms that were
placed against the wall, shivered them to pieces. One
of the splinters entered his head, and he fell dead on
the spot. The rest wounded several of the men beside
him.

A shell fell about the same time at the magazine
door. A blanket was the only partition between it
and the powder. We were sure all was over,âthat it
[Pg 70]

was impossible but that the magazine would be blown
up. We stood in awful suspense for the few seconds
between its fall and burstingâit burstâand already
we imagined ourselves in the air; but fortunately, it
did not communicate with the powder. There were
two artillery men in the magazine at the time, whose
feelings could not be very enviable.

In the course of the morning, General Stewart came
over from Cadiz to inspect the state of the fort, when
it was found that it could not stand out much longer.
A reinforcement of men from different regiments was
sent over to assist us, in case of the enemy attempting
to storm us in our disabled state, but we received little
assistance from them.

One of our sergeants, who, from his complexion,
was called the âBlack Prince,â had installed himself
commissary; and on the pretence of preventing the
men from getting drunk, he seated himself beside the
cask, which contained our ration wine, and fulfilled his
duty so faithfully that he would not even give the men
their allowance, but gave it away very liberally to any
of the strangers who could â
tip him the blarney
;â and
among hands âhe did not forget himself.â He got
rather tipsy at last; and the men getting clamorous
for their just allowance, to settle the dispute, he staved
the cask, and spilt the wine about the place.

Let it be observed, however, that I do not blame the
action, had his motive been to prevent the men getting
intoxicated, (the best proof of which, would have been
keeping sober himself;) but as the contrary was obviously
the case, it could only be attributed to caprice,
for he withheld the ration allowed from many of the men,
while he distributed to others what they chose to ask.

The affair was scarcely worth mentioning, only that
it will serve to show on what an uncertain basis a
soldierâs fame rests; for he was extolled to the skies,
and subsequently got a situation in the commissariat
department for that action; while others, who had
distinguished themselves by their valour and intrepid
exertions, were passed by unnoticed.

[Pg 71]

It being found that we could not keep the place,
boats were sent to convey us to Cadiz. Mines had
been previously laid, and a major of engineers came
over to superintend the operations for blowing up the
fort; but he had not taken many paces on the battery,
when he was struck by a cannon shot, and fell a lifeless
corpse.

It is remarkable to observe the covetousness of some
men, even in the midst of danger. When he fell, the
epaulettes were torn off his shoulders, and the gold
watch was taken out of his pocket. The watch was
afterwards recovered, but not, I believe, until the
chain and seals were disposed of.

The men were now busy gathering what things they
had together, and moving down to the boats. Some
of them had already sailed. I had now time to reflect
on the almost naked situation in which I was left, for
I had thrown off my great-coat at the commencement
of the action, and some one had taken it away. I ran
down to the bomb-proof, to try if I could find anything
to put on, but I met an engineer officer at the end of
the passage, with his sword drawn, who had been
inspecting the train laid to the mine. He asked me if
I wished to be blown up, and ordered me off instantly.

On coming up the ramparts, I found that all the
men had left the fort, with the exception of three or
four, and the commandant. He was watching the
motions of a strong party of French who were evidently
coming down to take the place. Our ammunition was
expended, but he ordered all the loose powder, grape,
and ball cartridge to be collected, and having stuffed
three guns (all we had left fit for service) to the muzzle
with them, we watched the enemy until within about
two hundred yards of the battery, when they were
fired into the very middle of their column, and laid the
half of them prostrate on the earth; the rest wheeled
to the right about and left us to embark at leisure.

A number of the men, who had been killed, were
lying on the ramparts. Some of them of the same
regiment to which I belonged. We resolved on giving
[Pg 72]

them some sort of burial, as the last kind office we
could perform. We gathered them into a temporary
hut, which had been built of mud, and, throwing it
down over them, âSleep there, brave comrades!â said
we: âfar distant, and ignorant of your fate, is the
wife or mother who would have composed your mangled
limbs.â Hurried and rude was their burial, and a
heart-felt sigh all their requiem, but it was more valuable
than the ostentatious trappings of affected woe.

We then hurried down to the boats; they were all
gone but one, and after entering, I learned from my
comrades that two men of the party who had come to
reinforce us had got themselves so beastly drunk that
they could not stir, and had been left behind.

We were not a great distance from the fort when it
blew up, but only partially. The French were still
firing, and one of the shells falling into a boat, which
preceded us, burst and killed three men, besides
wounding others. We were taken by the boats on
board of the Invincible seventy-four, where we were
very kindly treated; from that we were conveyed to
Cadiz.

The regiment I belonged to had removed to Isla
Camp, but we were marched up to our old barracks in
the bomb-proof, and a motley-looking group we were.
Half naked, and blackened with the smoke of the
gunpowder, we looked more like chimney-sweepers
than soldiers. We were received very coolly by the
Spaniards. They did not seem to feel any commiseration
for us on account of what we had suffered. I
imagined their looks expressed vexation rather at any
of us escaping alive.

When we reached the barrack, exhausted with
fatigue and want of sleep, I threw myself on the stone
floor. My mind was a chaos. The events of the
preceding thirty hours were all jumbled together in
my brain. Previous to that I had a good assortment
of necessaries, with a hundred and fifty dollars, and
some pieces of silk. I was now left with a pair of
canvass trowsers, my shirt, shoes, and forage cap; but
[Pg 73]

it was the fortune of war, and I soon forgot it all in a
profound sleep, I do not know how long I slept, but
when I awoke all my comrades had left the bomb-proof,
away drinking, with the exception of one or
two, who had been left as poor as myself.

I had received a wound in the leg from a splinter
of a shell during the action. At the time I paid little
attention to it, but it had now became so inflamed and
swelled that I could scarcely move it. My former
excitement of mind, with the fatigue I had endured,
had produced a proportionate debility, and my feelings
were no way enviable. Nothing could be more lonely,
desolate, and heartless, than the state in which I felt
myself the remaining part of that day.

CHAPTER IX.

The day following, we marched to join the regiment
at Isla Camp. Our comrades turned out to receive us,
and our hearts thrilled with exultation at the encomiums
passed on our bravery. The poor fellows flew
with alacrity to procure wine to treat us; amongst the
rest, my comrade Dennis was not backward. He and
I had been separated when I went to the fort, and he
was now overjoyed to see me. He seized my hand in
the warmth of his heart, and shook it so long, and
squeezed it so heartily, that I was ready to cry out
with the pain.

âMan alive, Joseph!â exclaimed he, âis it yourself
thatâs in it? troth, I thought Iâd never see you more,
for, when I saw the shot and shell flying about ye like
hailstones, I said to myself, âPoor comrade! itâs all
over with you;â but, thank God, here you are safe and
sound.â

âScarcely,â said I.

âWhatâs the matter, my dear fellow, are you
wounded?â

âSlightly, but that is not the worst of it, I have all
my kit on my back.â

[Pg 74]

âOch, if thatâs all, never fear, my boyâyouâll never
want while Dennis has a shirt in his knapsack, or a
cross in his pocket.â

And his were not empty professions; my heart
glows with grateful feeling to this moment at the
remembrance of his disinterested kindness. In my
chequered journey through life I met few friends of his
description.

After supplying me with things to change myself, he
procured a canteen of wine; and being joined by more
of our comrades, who were willing to show their good
will, and who had come equally well provided, we sat
down in the tent, and I soon forgot all that I had
suffered.

When the wine warmed my head, I entered into a
detail of our proceedings during the time we were in
the fort, and with a feeling of pride and exultationââfought
all the battle oâer again.â My comrades,
ranged around, greedily devoured the relation; and
their exclamations and remarks served to heighten my
enthusiasm. I can smile now at the warmth of my
feeling, and the high ideas I had then of a warriorâs
fame. Yet, I must say, that there is a feeling connected
with military enterprise, which will scarcely fail
to carry all before it, particularly in men of any
imagination. Military glory or fame, calmly considered,
certainly appears a mere bauble, an
ignis fatuus
:
but show me the man, of any soul, who could take this
view of it in the midst of battle; there the imagination
soars unconfined beyond every trammel, and gets into
the region of sublimity and enthusiasm.

Next day we were called out. The regiment formed
square, and the remains of our party was marched into
it. We were then addressed by our commanding
officer in terms of the highest eulogy, and held out to
the regiment as a pattern. The sergeant who had
distinguished himself by staving the wine cask, was
particularly addressed, and told that he would not be
lost sight of. We were then dismissed; but with the
exception of this sergeant, I do not remember any of
[Pg 75]

us who were thought of after the speech. For my
own part, I know that I found difficulty enough in
getting the sum of two pounds eight shillings, in lieu of
all that I had lost! The commandant, however, was
soon raised to the rank of major, and not long after
to that of lieutenant-colonel.

The regiments of the brigade in camp were busily
employed at this time working at the batteries, which
were building on the island; for which they received
ninepence per day, in addition to their pay. They had
also extra rations, such as coffee and sugar for breakfast,
and a pint of porter daily; but the labour was very
hard, and the exposure to the sun brought on sickness
amongst them.

Still we had little reason to complain, for we were
under the command of a general who did not think it
below him to look into the menâs rights and interests,
and anticipate their wants. It was not an uncommon
thing, in a very wet morning, to find him up at our
camp, ordering an extra ration of rum to be served
out to the brigade. There were also double tents
provided for us; as, in consequence of the heavy rains,
the single ones were found insufficient; and on every
occasion he paid the most indefatigable attention to
our comfort. In him was found a rare combination of
the rigid disciplinarian and the
soldierâs friend
. He
discharged his own duty faithfully and well; and he
expected every one under him to do the same, and
would admit of no excuse for the non-performance of
it from either officer or soldier. To those who served
under his command, in that place, it will be unnecessary
to say that the officer to whom I allude, is Lieutenant-General
the Hon. Sir William Stewart. His name will
be associated in their minds with the character of a
gallant and able officer, and a steady friend to the
soldier.

We generally turned out for the working party at
five oâclock in the morning; and our breakfast, which
was coffee with bread, was always ready at that hour.
I remember, the first time we had it, each man came
[Pg 76]

forward with his mess-tin for his allowance, which was
measured out by the cook. We had a Highlandman
in the company, who had enlisted raw from his native
hills, and who, I believe, had never seen anything of
the kind before. When he came for his allowance of
the coffee, which was now nearly done, the cook was
skimming it off the top very carefully, to avoid stirring
up the grounds. Donald, who thought this a scheme
to keep all the good part to himself, exclaimed, âTam
your plod! will youâll no gie some oâ the sik as well as
the sin?â

âOh, certainly,â said the cook, (who was a bit of a
wag,) and stirring the grounds well up, he gave him a
double proportion. Donald came in, chuckling with
satisfaction at having detected the knavery of the cook,
saying, âIf sheâll socht to sheat a Highlandman, sheâll
be far mistook;â and seeing the rest of his comrades
breaking bread in their coffee, he did the same: by
this time the eye of every one in the tent was on him,
scarcely able to refrain from laughing. Donald began
to sup it with his spoon; but after taking two or three
spoonfuls, grinding the coffee grounds between his
teeth, and making wry faces, he threw the tin, contents
and all, out of the tent door, exclaiming, âTam their
coffee! you might as weel chow heather, and drink pog
water as that teevilâs stuff. Giâe Donal a cog oâ brochan
before ony oâ your tea or coffees either.â

The French had once or twice made a powerful
attack on our picquets, but were repulsed with loss;
and the skirmishing at our outposts, and firing from the
batteries, were now carried on almost without intermission.
We expected them to make an attack on us
with their whole force; and scarcely a night passed
without being turned out, in consequence of movements
making on their side, notice of which was communicated
to the troops by different coloured rockets, thrown
up at our outposts.

At this time we had a strong force of British here.
Besides artillery and engineers, we had a battalion of
guards, and nine or ten regiments of the line. There
[Pg 77]

was also a strong fleet of British vessels in the bay;
at one time we had three first-rate men-of-war, namely,
the Caledonia, Hibernia, and Ville de Paris, besides
seventy-four gun ships, frigates, and a great number of
smaller vessels and gun-boats. Batteries were built
on every commanding situation: one of which (St
Fernando) we used to call the Friarsâ battery, having
been built in part by these gentry, and certainly among
the best deeds they had done in that part of the country.
It was on a very commanding situation, extending
completely across the Isthmus at its narrowest part,
with a wide trench, which could be filled with water
from the sea on either side.

At this time the wound on my leg, to which I had
paid little attention, became so ill that I was obliged to
go into the hospital; and I, in a great measure, lost
sight of what was going on amongst the troops. I had
now nothing to relieve the monotony of an hospital
life, unless a visit from Dennis now and then, when he
could gain time from working or duty; and one visit
from a sergeant, (a townsman,) who joined the regiment
at that time, and had brought a letter from my parents.
He had been long on the recruiting service, and was
considered a first-rate hand at it. After some inquiries
respecting my friends and native place, I happened to
remark how successful he had been in getting recruits,
and expressed my surprise that he should have been so
much more so than others who had been on the same
service. He replied, âNo wonder at itâno wonder at
all. I knew Glasgow well. It was my own placeâknew
the minds of the young fellows better than they
did themselvesâfor I had been a weaver myself, and
a lazy one too. I knew how I used to feel. In winter
it was too cold, and in summer too warm to work.
When it was good trade, I could not resist the temptation
of drinking and going idle two or three days in the
week; and when it was bad, I had no time to work
for trying to find out the cause, and setting the government
to rights. The truth is, you could scarcely ever
catch a weaver contented. They are always complaining.
[Pg 78]

Therefore, you would never have much trouble
enticing them to enlist, if you know how to go about
it; or much in going after them, for whenever they got
lazy, they came up and lounged about the Cross. You
could not manage them, however, the same as a
bumpkin. They were too knowing for that. The
best way was to make up to the individual you had in
your eye, and after bidding him the time of the day,
ask him what sort of web he had in. You might be
sure it was a bad one; for when a weaver turns lazy
his web is always bad: ask him how a clever, handsome-looking
fellow like him could waste his time hanging
see-saw between heaven and earth, in a damp, unwholesome
shop, no better than one of the dripping
vaults in St Mungoâs church, when he could breathe
the pure air of heaven, and have little or nothing to do,
if he enlisted for a soldier,âthat the weaving was
going to ruin, and he had better get into some berth,
or he might soon be starved. This was, generally,
enough for a weaver; but the ploughboys had to be
hooked in a different way. When you got into conversation
with them, tell how many recruits had
been made sergeants, when they enlistedâhow many
were now officers. If you saw an officer pass while
you were speaking, no matter whether you knew him
or not, tell him that he was only a recruit a year ago;
but now heâs so proud he wonât speak to you; but you
hope he wonât be so when he gets a commission. If
this wonât do, donât give up chaseâkeep to himâtell
him that in the place where your
gallant honourable

regiment is lying, every thing may be had almost for
nothing,âthat the pigs and fowls are lying in the
streets ready roasted, with knives and forks in them,
for the soldiers to eat, whenever they please. As you
find him have stomach, strengthen the dose, and he
must be overcome at last. But you must then proceed
quickly to work, before his high notions evaporate.
You must keep him drinkingâdonât let him go to the
door, without one of your party with him, until he is
passed the doctor and attested.â

[Pg 79]

âBut,â said I, âyou would not find every one so
easily duped.âââTo be sure,â said he, âsome of your
sentimental chaps might despise all this, but they were
the easiest caught after all. You had only to get into
heroics, and spout a great deal about glory, honour,
laurels, drums, trumpets, applauding world, deathless
fame, immortality, and all that, and you had him as
safe as a mouse in a trap.

âBut, if all these methods failed, and the fellow
remained obstinately determined against parting with
liberty, the next resource was to pretend you had been
joking with himâthat you had no wish to enlist any
man against his willâthat you had advised many a
one not to enlist. Ask him in to take a friendly glass,
ply him briskly, send one of your party out to put on
plain clothes; let another of your men bring him in as
a young man wishing to enlist, set him down next to
the man you have in your eye. After allowing them
some conversation, put the question to them, if they
were talking about enlisting. âYes, Iâll enlist,â would
be the reply of your man, âif this young man will go
also.â Perhaps he might; but if not, your last resource
was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his
pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning
swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get
him persuaded to pass the doctor, as it will save the

smart
should he be rejected. Should he pass, you must
try every means in your power to get him to drink,
blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the
magistrate in some shape or other, and get him
attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.â

âAt this rate,â said I, âmen are taken into the
service by as unfair means as they are pressed on board
a man-of-war. Were you not afraid of complaints
being made to your officers; and did the magistrates
not scruple to attest men who were drunk?â

âNot at all, man,â was the reply. âIt was war
times. As for the magistrates, we knew who to go to
on these occasions. You know it was all for the good
of the service.â

[Pg 80]

âBut had you no honour or conscience of your own?â
said I.

âHonour or conscience!â said he, laughing. âPretty
words in the mouth of a private soldier. You must do
your duty, you know. A good soldier does what he is
ordered, right or wrong.â

âBut I am afraid,â said I, âthat you did more than
you were ordered.â

âPerhaps we were not ordered to do all that we
did; but we were blackguarded if we didnât get men,
and that was the same thing; and whatâs the use of a
man if he canât take a hint?â
[7]

âYou must have made a good deal of money in this
way.â

âMoney!â said he, âno, no. Did you ever hear of
men making money on the recruiting service? They
must have come from the north if they did. No, our
money didnât do much goodâit all went in raking and
drinking. âIt melted awaâ like snaw aff a dyke,â as
the old women at home would say, and we left Glasgow
with bad kitts, and worse constitutions.â

âWell,â said I, âyou may be glad you have left it,
for more reasons than one, and I hope you will never
return to it.â The conversation was dropped, and he
soon left me; but I could not help thinking how many
poor fellows were thus inveigled into a profession they
did not like, and rendered miserable the remainder of
their lives.

While here I was near losing my life in a very
simple manner. There was a garden behind the
hospital, which had formerly been a gentlemanâs house,
kept by a Spanish gardener, who raised vegetables for
the Isla market. In it there was a cistern, from which
the water ran when required to water the garden; and
this was supplied by a contrivance very unlike anything
I have seen in Britain, although common enough
on the Continent. It was raised from a deep well, by
[Pg 81]

means of pitchers attached to the circumference of a
large wheel, which, revolving by the power of a horse
and gin, were successively filled and emptied into the
cistern. To this cistern the men who were able
brought their things to wash; but the gardener, who
either thought that the soap used spoiled his vegetables,
or from sheer crossness, tried every means in
his power to prevent them.

One day, while here dabbling my linen, he came to
the cistern in a rage, and seizing my shirts he threw
them into a dunghill close by. This act was far from
pleasing me, and I applied my fist to his ear in a very
unceremonious manner. This he returned, as is the
usual custom with Spaniards, by drawing his knife,
and making a thrust at me. I saw there was no safety
unless in closing with him, to get it out of his hand;
but as I got in upon him, he made a lunge at me, and
drove it through my coat and shirt, grazing my ribs.
I seized the hand which held it with both of mine, and
tripped up his heels. We both came to the ground.
He was now foaming at the mouth. I could not disengage
his hand; and it would have been a doubtful
thing who would have prevailed had not some of my
comrades come into the garden at that moment. They
freed his hand from the knife, which they withdrew
and threw it into the cistern. They then left me to
manage the Spaniard as I best could, which I found no
difficulty in doing, as he could not use his fists with
much effect. He, however, managed to bite me several
times, before I had done with him.

I was obliged to be extremely cautious after this, as
long as I was in the hospital; for I often saw him
lurking about, eyeing me like a tiger watching his
prey, and, no doubt, if he could have got an opportunity,
he would have despatched me.

We had little opportunity of knowing much about
the Spaniards here; but what we did know gave us no
great idea of them, particularly the lower class. They
seemed to be a jealous-minded, vindictive, and
cowardly race, grossly ignorant and superstitious.
[Pg 82]

Their soldiers are complete scarecrows, (I speak of
them as I found them in every part of Spain,) badly
clothed, ill paid, and worse officered. There could not
be imagined a more barbarous-looking, grotesque assemblage
of men in the world than a Spanish regular
regiment. No two men are dressed alikeâone wants
shoes, another a coat, another has a slip of blanket,
with a hole cut in the middle, and his head thrust
through it, a lapell hanging before and another behind.
It is a rare thing to find one of them with his accoutrements
complete; and their arms are kept in such order,
that if brought into action, the half of them would be
useless. On the march they have no regularityâjust
like a flock of sheep; and such chattering amongst
them, that you would take it for the confusion of
tongues at Babel!

They rarely ever succeeded at anything unless
Guerilla fighting, and then only when they could take
their victims by surprise, or when they were double or
triple the number of their enemy.

There are certainly many brave and noble souls
amongst them, whose hearts beat high in the cause of
liberty, and who have evinced it by their gallant enthusiasm;
but unfortunately they are but a small
number, in comparison to the millions who are sunk in
slavish ignorance and superstition.

FOOTNOTES:

[7]
I do not know whether the sergeant exaggerated or not; but,
in justice to the service, I must remark that such stratagems are
neither authorised nor resorted to at present.

CHAPTER X.

We had been about seven months in Cadiz, when the
regiment to which I belonged was again embarked;
and after a passage of eleven days landed at Lisbon.
We remained there two or three days, making preparation
for our advance; and were then conveyed in boats
up the Tagus to Villa Franca, on our way to join the
grand army under the command of Lord Wellington.
From Villa Franca we marched to the convent of
Alcantara, situated in a bleak moor; it had been
wholly deserted by the monks, and the interior of it
[Pg 83]

completely destroyed. From that we moved to Rio
Mayor, where we were for the first time quartered on
the inhabitants; they seemed comparatively settled
and happy to those of other places, where the troops
had more frequently passed. The site of this village
was beautifulâthe river, from which it took its name,
glided past it in silent majesty, skirted with rows of
large trees; between which could be seen the sloping
fields of maize, interspersed with vineyards, where the
bunches of large purple-coloured grapes were peeping
forth, half hid by the green foliage with which they
were surrounded, tempting, as it were, the passenger
to try how deliciously they tasted; and some of our
men could not resist the temptation, although they
were forbidden fruit. There was something about this
village so calm and serene, combined with the simple
scenery around, which forcibly brought back to my
imagination the Sabbath in a country village on the
banks of the Clyde. I almost considered myself at
home; and when I left it a day after, I felt grieved, as
if leaving a place with which I had been long acquainted.

After halting one day here, we proceeded on the
main road as far as Cavallos. Here we received information,
from men going to the rear sick, that our
army was retreating, after having fought an action at
Busaco. This intelligence was soon confirmed by cars
coming in with the woundedâthose who had suffered
slightly were walking, while others, whose wounds
were more severe, were either sitting or lying on the
cars, which from their construction were ill calculated
for conveying sick and wounded men. They were
about five feet long, and two and a-half broad; but
instead of being boarded at the sides, there were
stakes placed in holes about eighteen inches apart;
the wheels were about two feet in diameter, rather
octagonal than round; and as they were not girt with
iron, it was quite a common thing to have a piece
broken out of the circumference, and of course every
time the wheel turned, the whole car was violently
[Pg 84]

shaken. This was drawn by a pair of oxen, yoked by
the head. A peasant, with a long stick and a sharp
nail in the end of it, walked before them, and every
now and then run his goad into their shoulders to
hasten their pace. This generally produced an awkward
zig-zag trot for a few yards, when the jolting occasioned
by the inequality of the wheels, caused the most excruciating
torture to the poor fellows who were in them,
and forced them to groan with agony. In this manner,
exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and going
at the rate of two miles an hour, they had to travel to
Lisbon, a distance of forty or fifty miles, before they
reached an hospital. The wounded continued to pass
during the remaining part of the day, and throughout
the whole night.

The continual creaking of their wheels was intolerable.
I know of nothing in this country I can liken it
to, unless the grating of an iron door on rusty hinges,
but it was still worse than that. The Portuguese never
put any grease on their wheels; for they think the
noise of them frightens away the devil. The consequence
is, that the axletree often takes fire with the
friction, and burns completely through. I never after
could bear the noise of those cars. The hideous grating
sound was always associated in my mind with the
pallid faces and piercing groans of the wounded whom
we that day saw passing.

Next morning we got orders to march across the
country to Alcobaco, where we were to join the third
division of the army, commanded by General Picton.
This was a beautiful little village, with a very large
convent in it, occupied by Bernardine monksâone of
the richest orders in Portugal. It was built by
Alphonso the First, to fulfil a vow made by him after
the taking of Santarem from the Moors, and for its
support he endowed it with all the land within view of
its walls, which was not a little, for the prospect was
extensive.

When we entered the village, we found it empty of
inhabitants; for they had fled with precipitation when
[Pg 85]

they heard that our army was retreating, leaving every
thing behind them, but what money or jewels they
could carry about their persons. We were quartered
in one of the passages of the convent. The monks had
all left it, with the exception of a few who remained
to superintend the removal of some of their precious
articles.

I forget how many hundred monks there were cells
for in the convent; but an idea of its size may be
formed, when it is known that a whole division of the
army, consisting of not less than five thousand men,
were lodged in the galleries alone, without filling them.
Attached to it was a spacious chapel, the whole inside
of which was decorated in the most superb style; the
walls covered with valuable paintings, and in it a magnificent
organ.

In the convent was the library, which contained a
selection of many thousand volumes, with philosophical
apparatus.

Contiguous to the church belonging to the convent
there was a Gothic mausoleum of hewn stone, in the
midst of which were two magnificent sepulchres of
white marble, containing the remains of Don Pedro
the First of Portugal, and of Dona Ignes de Castro,âa
description of whose tragical death forms a beautiful
episode in the third book of the Luciad.

The kitchen of the holy fathers, which was on the
sunk floor, presented a scene of plenty, which was not
very favourable to the opinion of their severe abstinence.
It was about a hundred feet long; the fire-place, which
was raised on cast-iron pillars in the centre of the
apartment, was thirty feet long, by twelve wide; a
stream of water ran through the kitchen, which was
occasionally overflown to cleanse the floor, and also
supplied the tanks in which they kept live fish.
Certainly, if they lived as well every day as they
seemed to do while we were there, they could not boast
much of fasting; for, in their larders, and kitchen,
there was a profusion of every delicacy which could be
thought of. Their cellar contained upwards of seven
[Pg 86]

hundred pipes of the choicest wines, and in the gardens
belonging to the convent were the rarest and finest
fruits, besides vegetables and plants of every description.

To judge from what we saw, they ought to have been
the happiest fellows imaginable. Good eating and
drinking, fine grounds to walk in, and plenty of books!
What could they wish for more? It is likely,
however, that their usual mode of living was not so
luxurious as we were inclined to think, from what we
saw of their kitchen; but I suppose they considered it
better to use what they could of their dainties, than
leave them to the French; and, to tell the truth, the
poor monks did not seem to have any great appetite
while we were there: for any of our men who entered
the kitchen were liberally supplied with anything that
was cooked.

Previous to the regiment being dismissed, the colonel
cautioned us against taking anything which had been
left by the inhabitants. Before the division came in, I
believe this order was punctually obeyed, and our men
walked peaceably up and down the streets, the same as
they would have done in a village at home; but when
the other regiments, composing the division, arrived,
the scene was soon changed; for they scarcely took
time to take off their knapsacks, before they commenced
breaking up the doors, and plundering every thing they
could lay their hands on.

Some of our men, considering, I suppose, that they
might as well have a share of the spoil as the others,
joined in the throng; but they had a lesson to learn
which some of them paid for rather dearly. They
were not aware that there was a provost marshal
[8]

attached to each division.

And while they were busy he came upon them with
his guard: the old campaigners made good their retreat,
but our
innocent boys
, (as the Irish regiments in the
division called them,) not being acquainted with his
[Pg 87]

person or power, kept their ground, and were so
warmly received, that they did not forget either him or
his kindness while in the division.

An inspection was made next day of the division,
to ascertain whether they had any plunder in their
knapsacks, and anything found more than the regulated
compliment of necessaries was taken from them. The
town fell into the hands of the French the following
day, and it may be thought that it would have been
better to allow us to take the things left than that they
should fall into the hands of the enemy; but nothing
is more subversive of discipline in an army than the
habit of plundering, exclusive of the men, through
covetousness, burdening themselves in such a way
that they cannot march. Whether the means used to
prevent it were the best and most efficient, I do not
pretend to say; but there can be no doubt as to the
necessity of preventing it as much as possible.

In the course of this day, the monks who had been
left departed in chaises, and took not a few boxes of
doubloons with them. The greater part of the pipes
of wine in the cellars were staved, to prevent them
falling into the hands of the enemy. We left the convent
that afternoon, and having marched as far as
Torres Vedras, encamped outside of the town.

When I say encamped, I do not mean that we
pitched tents, for the army were not supplied with tents,
until the last campaign in 1813-14. At this time, the
blue canopy of heaven was all our covering, the earth
our bed, and a single blanket our bed-clothes.

A newly-ploughed field, on the face of a hill, was
our portion. We got out our blankets, and lay down,
expecting to get a comfortable nap, although the
weather was rather cold; but towards morning, it
began to rain so heavily that we were soon wet to
the skin. Some, who had a little wisdom in their
heads, got up, and packed up their blankets; but
others lay still, until they were literally floated with
water and mud, which came rolling in streams down
the ridges, in such a way that they could scarcely be
[Pg 88]

distinguished from the soil around. They were then
obliged to get up, and squeeze their blankets in that
wet and dirty state into their knapsacks. The rain
got heavier, the longer it continued, and we stood
huddled together, shivering with cold and wet. At
last, an order came for us to march into Torres
Vedras; but such a march I never saw, even in the
worst of times afterwards. We were novices in the
business, and not yet weather-proof. Had it not been
that the town was so near, we would have occupied
three or four miles of a line of road, we were so
straggled. The ground was of a clayey nature, and
with the rain that fell it had become like bird-lime.
Our feet stuck fast at every step, and our shoes were
actually torn off, and many of them were left lying in
the clay. Some were walking barefoot; others in
their stockings, without shoes; and more had one
shoe on, and another carrying in their hand. We
were a set of drenched and miserable-looking creatures,
and the officers were in as bad a plight as
ourselves.

At last we reached the town and got into houses;
but the village was too small, and we were crowded in
such a way that we had scarcely room to sit down.
In the course of the day, however, arrangements were
made; and some of the regiments sent to other villages,
so that we were better accommodated.

During the time we were in the Peninsula, the
troops suffered much from exposure to rain; and
nothing renders a soldier so uncomfortable as having
wet clothes about him; or, I believe, hurts his health
more, when first exposed to it. I have often wondered
that no means were taken to prevent this. Many of
the officers had oil-cloth cloaks that completely covered
them. Some such thing for the men would have been
neither expensive nor heavy to carry, and would have
been the means of saving many lives. Much more
attention ought also to be paid to the quality of the
shoes served out to the army, for they in general are
of the very worst kind, and it was no uncommon thing
[Pg 89]

for our store shoes to be in tatters before we had worn
them a week.

After a stay of a few days here, we removed to
Cadaciera in the same line of position, which extended
from the Tagus to the sea. We had not long taken up
our quarters in the village, where our whole brigade
was, when a peasant entered it, driving a flock of
sheep before him. In a moment, a race was made
amongst them by some of the soldiers. Others, stimulated
by their example, followed; and in a few minutes,
officers and men were seen promiscuously scrambling
for the mutton. Dennis joined in the throng, and had
seized one of them, at the same moment that an officer
of the Irish regiment in the brigade made a grasp at
it. âGive me that sheep, sir,â said the officer in an
authoritative tone. âArrah, be aisy, honey!â said
Dennis. âKill a Hessian for yourself, if you plase.â
[9]

The officer relinquished his claim, and pursued another.
The poor Portuguese shepherd stood like a statue, not
knowing well what to do. At last, when he found
himself relieved from all his charge, he went away,
lamenting and muttering curses on the â
ladrones
Englese
,â
[10]
to make his complaint to the general.

Soon after, a wine store was found out, and as
plundering was the order of the day, the contents of it
were soon lessened. This depredation was discovered
by the men becoming intoxicated. The most severe
investigation and search took place, and those with
whom any of the stolen property was found were
confined, tried by a court martial, and flogged; but
they were not the most guilty who suffered.

While we remained in this position, we were obliged
to be under arms two hours before daylight, and
[Pg 90]

remain until clear day; and for a few days after, these
two hours were pretty well occupied by flogging.

Terror seems to be the only engine of rule in the
army; but I am fully persuaded in my own mind that
if a more rational method were taken, the character
of the soldier in quarters would be as exemplary as in
the field.

I cannot adduce any reasonable excuse for this
wanton breach of honesty; for we were regularly
supplied with rations at the time; but I imagine that
most of the men were led into it by the example set by
others, without taking time to think about the impropriety
of the action. The soldier could scarcely think
that there was any harm in the deed which an officer
joined in. This was rather rare, however; but many
of them had no objection to participate in what was
stolen, which to me appeared equally blameable.

When settled in a place for any time, the brigade
assembled on Sundays for divine service. We were
always in full marching order on these occasions; and
not uncommonly had a field day after it. If a person
were to judge from the hitching of knapsacks, and wry
faces that were making, during this ceremony, he would
have thought the soldiers would rather have dispensed
with it; but I dare say, the anticipation of the drill
that was to follow, prevented them from feeling much
benefit from their devotions.

The first Sunday after the outrage already related,
when the chaplain left his station, General Picton took
his place.

This was the first time he had addressed us. I felt
anxious to examine the features of a man who had been
so much the public talk on account of his reputed
cruelty at Trinidad. I could not deny that I felt a
prejudice against him, and his countenance did not do
it away; for it had a stern and gloomy expression,
which, added to a very dark complexion, made it no
way prepossessing; but when he opened his mouth,
and began to pour forth a torrent of abuse on us for our
conduct, and his dark eye flashed with indignation, as
[Pg 91]

he recapitulated our errors, âhope withering fled, and
mercy sighed farewell.â He wound up the particular
part of his speech addressed to us with, â
You are a
disgrace to your moral country, Scotland!
â That had
more weight than all his speech. It sunk deep in our
hearts. To separate a Scotsman from his countryâto tell
him he is unworthy of itâis next to taking away his life.

But General Picton was not the character which we,
by prejudice, were led to think him. Convinced of
the baneful effects of allowing his men to plunder,
he set his face sternly against it, but in other respects
he was indulgent; and although no man could blame
with more severity when occasion required, he was no
niggard of his praise when it was deserved. Nothing
could surpass his calm intrepidity and bravery in
danger; and his presence in battle had the effect
of a talisman, so much had his skill and valour gained
the confidence of the men under his command.

The provost marshal is invested with power to inflict summary
punishment on all soldiers whom he may find plundering, or straggling
from their regiment.

I asked Dennis what the expression meant. He said that
during the rebellion, a number of Hessian soldiers had been in
Ireland, and an âUnited Man,â having shot one of them, was busy
plundering him, when one of his comrades asked share of the booty.
âKill a Hessian for yourself, my gay fellow,â was the reply.

CHAPTER XI.

From Torres Vedras, we removed to Alcoentre, a
small village some miles in rear of Rio Mayor; and we
were kept pretty busy while in it, strengthening our
position, making batteries, breast-works, abattis, &c.

The general of the brigade was quartered in the
same village; and as he had, or seemed to have, a
great antipathy to every thing Scottish, our regiment
of course was included, and he found means to annoy
us a good deal. Perhaps, he believed, with many
people in England, that the Scots run wild about their
native hills, eating raw oats like horses, with nothing
but a kilt to cover their nakedness, and that they had
no right to receive any other treatment, when they
entered the army, than what is usually given to any
wild animal when caged. âRousing up with a long
poleâ seemed to be his hobby. When exercising in the
field, our regiment could do nothing right. When our
guard turned out to salute him, they were either too
[Pg 92]

late, or they did not present arms properly; and he
would order the sergeant to drill them for an hour;
while he stood by and gave vent to the harsh epithets
which he was in the habit of using on those occasions,
âScottish savagesâstupidâbarbarous,â &c.

I have often been led to think that he studied expletives
on purpose. He pretended that he could not understand
a word that any of us saidâthat we spoke
GÃ¦lic; and his aid-de-camp was called to interpret,
although he had no right to understand what was said
better than himself, for I believe he was also an
Englishman.

As a sampleâhe once took a fancy to the wooden
cases which the Portuguese use instead of stirrup irons,
and ordered his Scottish servant to get a pair for him;
for although he disliked the Scots, he employed them
as his servants. The man procured them; but they
were not fellows.

âWell, sir,â said the general, âhave you got those
things?â

âYes, sir, but they are no marrows.â

âMarrows! marrows! whatâs that? whatâs that?â
and calling his aid-de-camp, he asked him what âthe
Scottish savageâ said.

âHe means, sir, that they are not fellows.â

âPoh! poh! you surely do not pretend to understand
what is no language.â

âThat is his meaning in his own language, sir.â

âNonsense, sir, you are as bad as he; go and read
your dictionary.â

He was very strict in duty affairs, particularly in
details, which perhaps another general would not have
troubled his head about. He was very fond of surprising
the sentinels at the outposts, by taking circuitous
routes, and keeping under cover of the bushes. On
one occasion, however, he met his match, if the story
reported was true: but as I only had it from report, I
will not pledge myself for its truth.

One of the men on picquet was planted as outpost
sentry on the road leading to Rio Mayor.

[Pg 93]

âNow, George,â said the corporal to him, as he was
leaving him, âmind that the general is out in front,
keep a good look out, or he may surprise you, and you
know the consequence. Be sure you challenge in time.â

âLeave that to me,â said Geordie.

A short time after (it was dusk when he was posted)
he heard some one coming up the road very cautiously,
as if wishing to avoid observation. At last, when
about to turn the road, the individual, who was on
horseback, clapped spurs to his horse, apparently for
the purpose of passing him before he could challenge.
There was no time to lose, and many a poor fellow
might have been so confused at being taken unawares,
that he would have neglected to challenge before the
person was on him. Not so with Geordie. The
moment he saw him quicken his pace, he challenged.
The challenge was either not heard or purposely unheeded.
Another challenge was given; the general
continued his gallop without answering. âYouâll no
tak me in that way, my gentleman,â said Geordie; and
as he gave the third and last challenge, he came to the
present, and made a bullet whiz past the generalâs ear.
The horse was drawn in immediately.

âWhat! do you mean to shoot your general, you rascal?â

âI dinna ken wha folk are in the dark; but whether
youâre a general or no, my orders are to fire at ony
body that attempts to pass me without answering when
I challenge. Itâs the generalâs orders; and I ken what
I would get if I didna obey them.â

âWell, sir, I am your general; and I wish to pass
into the town.â

âIâm no sure about yeâye may be some French spy
for ony thing I ken; and ye maun just stay whar ye are
till the sergeant oâ the picquet comes; heâll no be lang
now, for the report oâ my piece would alarm them.â

At that moment the picquet arrived, and the general
was allowed to proceed; but from that time, he did
not trouble the outpost sentries so much.

Some time before we left these quarters to advance,
an attack was made by the French, under General
[Pg 94]

Junot, on our advanced posts; and we were ordered
under arms to defend our position, in the event of them
pushing forward. During that day, and the succeeding
night, the baggage of the troops in front, along with
the inhabitants of the surrounding country, filled the
road leading through our village. It was a melancholy
sight to see the poor natives, carrying their children,
and any little thing which they were able to bring
with them, moving along the road, after having left
their homes and propertyâtravelling they knew not
whither, desolate and friendless. In a few days they
might be reduced to beg, or perhaps (what was not
uncommon in Portugal) die of hunger. Alas! thought
I, what misery war causes! I hope I will never see my
own country in such a state.

The French were beaten back, and our troops
resumed their former station; but few of the inhabitants
returned. Not long after this, we were reviewed,
along with part of the first division, by Lord Wellington.
From the place where we were assembled, we could
see Santarem, General Massenaâs head-quarters. Next
day (the sixth of March) the whole army was ordered
to advance, as the French had retreated in three
divisions, by separate routes during the night.

This opened the campaign of 1811. From Alcoentre
we marched to Rio Mayor (our former quarters when
we were on our way to join the army;) but it was
sadly altered,âthe inhabitants had mostly all left it;
the houses were in ruins; and it wore a desolate
appearance. Next day we crossed to Alcaneyde.
From thence we proceeded to Porto de Mos.

When we entered the latter place, there was a large
convent fronting us, which, as well as many of the
houses, had been set on fire by the French. I never
before witnessed such destruction. The finest furniture
had been broken up for firewood; the very floors torn
up, beds cut in pieces, with their contents thrown about,
intermixed with kitchen utensils, broken mirrors, china,
&c. &c., all in one heterogeneous mass of ruin, and
not an inhabitant to be seen.

[Pg 95]

We had scarcely taken up our quarters, until I was
called out for duty, and placed on the commissary
guard. The mules with the stores had arrived, and
the store-keeper looking for a place to put them in,
when we joined him. At last he pitched on a chapel
for the purpose. There was a large fire in the middle
of the floor, on which was heaped broken pieces of the
altar, wooden images, frames of pictures; even the
ornamented wood-work of the organ was broken up for
the purpose.

In searching for the cleanest place to set down the
bags of biscuit, we found a door leading to some place
apart from the chapel. As it was quite dark, I caught
up a burning piece of wood to inspect the placeâbut
what was my horror, when I entered and found the
half-consumed skeletons of human beings on every side;
some lying, others kneeling, and more of them standing
upright against the walls. The floor was covered with
ashes, in many places still red. I stood fixed to the
spotâthe burning stick dropped from my hand. I
informed some of my comrades of what we had seen,
and we re-entered. Such an appalling sight was never
witnessed. Of those who had sunk on the floor,
nothing remained but the bones; while the others, who
were in a kneeling or standing posture, were only partially
consumed; and the agonised expression of their
scorched and blackened features was awful beyond
description.

Next morning we continued our march to Leria, and
on entering it found it burned. We were quartered
in a convent outside the town, which was partially
consumed, where we remained the succeeding day.

On the top of a hill, to the left of the town, was a
sort of redoubt. I went with Dennis to take a view of
the place, and going up to where some of our soldiers
were standing, we found three children lying, two
already dead, but the other was still breathing. There
were pieces of biscuit lying beside them, which our
soldiers had broughtâbut it was too late. They had
evidently perished from hunger; one of them had
[Pg 96]

expired with the bit in his mouth. This was part of
the horrors of war; but only a part. The wanton
cruelty of the French soldiers, on this retreat, defies
description.

From Leria we advanced towards Pombal, in front
of which the French army had concentrated their force
and made a stand; but they retired during the night,
and took up a strong position at the end of a defile
between Pombal and Redinha, with their right on a
wood, and their left occupying the high ground above
the river of Redinha, the town being in their rear.
In this position our division attacked their left, the
light division their right, and the fourth their centre;
the rest of our army being in reserve. Their right was
soon dislodged from their position in the wood, and
retreated across a narrow bridge over the Redinha,
followed by our light troops; but as the fords and
bridge were commanded by their cannon, some time
was lost before a sufficient number of troops could be
passed over, to make a new disposition to attack the
heights on which they had taken post. A portion of
the division crossed the river by swimming, headed by
Major Lloyd; but the columns moved on towards the
bridge. As we were advancing, a cannon shot from
the enemy struck our column, killed a sergeant, and
wounded two or three men; besides tearing our armourerâs
knapsack open, and scattering its contents
about in every directionâthe poor fellow was so frightened
that he grew sick, went to the rear, and soon
after died.

Our troops having passed the river, we soon drove
them from their position back upon the main body,
and next day their whole army was strongly posted at
Condeixa. Our division was ordered to march through
the mountains on their left towards the only road open
for their retreat, which had the effect of dislodging
them from their strong position; here our part of the
duty was very fatiguing, for the hills were so steep that
we had to scramble up the one side on our hands and
feet, and slide down in the same manner on the other.

[Pg 97]

The French had retreated in such haste from their
position at Condeixa that they left the communication
with Coimbra unguarded, and our army communicated
with Colonel Trant and the Portuguese militia, who
were in possession of it.

They were now obliged to abandon all the positions
which they had successively taken in the mountains,
and their rear guard was thrown back on the main
body at Miranda de Corvo, from which they immediately
retreated, destroying part of their ammunition
and baggage. At this place we passed many dead
bodies of French and Portuguese, lying on the road;
and one part of it was covered with asses, which the
French had hamstrung before they left them. It was
pitiable enough to see the poor creatures in this state;
yet there was something ludicrous in the position that
the animals had taken, when thus cruelly lamed; they
were sitting in a group upon their hinder end, staring
in each otherâs faces, seemingly in deep consultation on
some important subject, and looking as grave and dull
as many an assembly of their
biped brethren
at home.

The enemy now took up a new position on the
river Ceira, leaving a division at a small village as an
advanced guard, which was attacked by the third and
light divisions, and after some hard fighting their army
retired across the Ceira during the night, destroying
the bridge. The enemy suffered severely here, for
besides their killed and wounded, numbers were
drowned in crossing the river.

Having taken up another position, from which they
were driven by our division, with the first, and light,
they concentrated their whole army on the Seirra
Moito, from which they retired on the eighteenth,
and our army occupied the ground they had left.
They now continued their retreat so rapidly that our
army, with the exception of our division, the sixth,
and light, were halted for the necessary supplies of
provision to come up. From this until the twenty-seventh
we followed them through the mountains,
harassing their rear, and suffered much fatigue, for
[Pg 98]

during that time we were very ill supplied with rations,
at times wanting bread and rum for two days together,
and when we did get it, perhaps only half allowance;
we were almost always supplied with beef, but it was
of that description that there was little nourishment in
it. The cattle were brought from Barbary, and often
had to travel many hundred miles before they were
used, with very little to eat during their journey; the
consequence was, that when killed they were nothing
more than a mass of emaciated muscle, with a semi-transparent
covering of, what would be a perversion of
language to call fatâit was more like a coating of
train oil. It was never bled properly; and when
boiled, it was as tough and stringy as a piece of junk.
The water it was boiled in was dignified with the name
of soup: and if the blood which boiled out of the beef,
along with the wood ashes that fell into it, constituted
soup, we had it in perfection.

One day we had halted rather early; at this time
we had been without rations for two days. Many a
curse was poured on the head of the commissary, who
was considered the responsible person.

âThere comes the stores, at last,â cried one of the
men.

âWhere? where?â said those around. Every eye
was now directed to a hill at some distance, where a
long train of mules were perceived successively rising
over its summit, and bending their way towards the
division. The men were in transports of joy; a
general cheer greeted their appearance.

âWe will have full rations to-day,â cried one; âand
rum too,â said another, âfor I can see casks on the
mules.â

Another cheer succeeded this discovery; and we
were dancing about overjoyed. âWho goes for the
rations? Get out blankets for the biscuit, and camp
kettles for the rum.â There were soon enough of
volunteers for this duty. The mules had by this time
got into a sort of defile. Every eye was on the stretch,
waiting for their re-appearance. As the first mule
[Pg 99]

emerged from the place where they were hid, every
face was dressed in smiles; but the next second produced
an effect, similar to that which a criminal might
feel, who had been informed of his reprieve on the
scaffold, and the next moment told it was a mistake;
for it turned out to be mules with ammunition for the
division. Never did I witness such a withering effect
on men, as this disappointment produced. We stood
looking at each other for a minute, in all the agony of
hope deferred: the next was opened by a torrent of execration
on all concerned. Those who have never experienced
extreme hunger can form no idea of our feelings.

A day or two after this, we crossed a river and
ascended a hill, where we encamped. Dennis and I
were for duty, and both placed on the out picquet,
which was posted on the face of a hill in front of the
division. The French were on the opposite rise, and a
small river ran at the foot of it. We had only got one
dayâs rations from the time the incident mentioned
above occurred; and as Dennis expressed it, âour
bellies were thinking our throats were cut.â

I procured leave from the officer to go to the river
for water; intending to proceed a little farther down,
to try if I could find anything that I could eat.
Turning round the hill, I came to a mill; and entering
it, found a number of soldiers belonging to different
regiments of the division busy grinding Indian corn;
others were employed drawing a baking of bread,
which the French had left in their hurry, when we
took up our position. I attempted to help myself to
some corn, which was lying in a basket.

âDrop that like a hot potato,â said one of the
Connaught Rangers.

I tried another basket, but it was also appropriated;
and as there were none of my regiment there, I could
not expect to succeed by force; so I left the place
sorrowful enough, on my way back to the picquet, with
a cargo of cold waterâpoor cheer, certainly. But just
as I turned round the hill, I met my friend Dennis,
who had got leave from the officer on some pretence to
[Pg 100]

go down to the river. I told him my melancholy
story; he paused for a moment; then clapping his
hand to his forehead, he exclaimed, âNow I have it!
Give me the canteens.â

When I gave them to him, he poured out the water,
and slung them over his shoulder.

âNow, just stand there a minute,â said he, âand Iâll
show you a scatter.â

He then commenced running, with the canteens
clattering at his back. Those who were in the mill,
being startled by the noise, looked out to see what was
the matter. When Dennis saw them, he cried out,
âOch, ye rogues oâ the world, run for your lives; for
the division has fell in, and the provost is coming down
with his guard; and every one of yees will be taken.â

They were all out in a moment.

âWhich way is he coming?â

âThis way,â said Dennis, pointing to the way he had
come himself. âI am on picquet, and I just run down
to give you warning.â

They all took to their heels in the opposite direction,
leaving the field clear to Dennis and me; and we lost
no time in filling our haversacks.

The right of the French army had retreated by the
high road upon Celerico, but the left (which we were
pursuing) had fallen back upon Govea and the mountains
of Guarda; and having augmented their force, held
the position in great strength. Our army having
collected in the neighbourhood of Celerico, on the
morning of the 29th our division moved for the purpose
of flanking the enemy, and the light and sixth divisions
having moved also, by different routes, in the direction
of Guarda, the attack was combined in such a manner
that the enemy were nearly surprised, and abandoned
many of their effects in their flight, without attempting
to fire a shot, notwithstanding the strong position they
occupied,
[11]
and retired on Sabugal on the Coa, leaving
an advanced guard on our side.

[Pg 101]

The position which the enemy had now taken was very
strong, the river behind which they were posted being difficult
of access, and could only be approached by its left.

Our troops were set in motion on the morning of the
third April, to turn the enemyâs left above Sabugal,
and to force the passage of the bridge of that town. A
strong corps of the enemy were posted on a height
immediately above the bridge.

The light division and cavalry were ordered to cross
the river at two separate fords, upon the enemyâs left.
The fifth division and artillery were destined to attack
the bridge, and our division to cross at a ford about a mile
above the town. The light division crossed first, and
commenced the attack, but they were warmly received,
and the action was for some time doubtful. Our
division now crossed and attacked their centre; while
at the same time the fifth division crossing the bridge,
ascended the heights on the right flank of the enemy,
and the cavalry appeared in rear of their left; they
made a precipitate retreat, leaving a howitzer in possession
of the light division, and about two hundred killed
on the ground, six officers, and three hundred prisoners.

As we descended the hill towards the river, we passed
a convent or chapel, half way down; at the door lay
an old man, who had been killed with a musket shot,
and a genteelly-dressed Portuguese was standing beside
him; he spoke to us as we passed, but we had no time
then to pay any attention to what he said. We learned
after, from the men who were following us with the
baggage, that he had been hung up by some of the
French soldiers, because he would not, or could not,
show them where he had hid his money. His old father,
who was lying at the door, had been shot, and his
motherâs throat cut. His sisters had been first violated by
[Pg 102]

the monsters, and then cruelly used: one of them had
her eyes blackened, and the other her arm broken.
His life was saved by the French General, who came
up just as he had been suspended, and ordered him to
be cut down. Such were the tender mercies of the
French soldiery!

When we had gained the edge of the river, the
French columns were posted on the height above us.
We passed the river under a heavy fire, and proceeded
to ascend the hill. We could now see that more of
our army had crossed, both to our right and left. As
we advanced up the hill, we formed line. General
Picton rode up in front of us, with his stick over his
shoulder, exposed to the heavy fire of the enemy, as
composedly as if he had been in perfect safety.
âSteady, my lads, steady!â said he; âdonât throw away
your fire until I give you the word of command.â We
were now close on them; the balls were whizzing
about our ears like hailstones. The man before me
received a shot in the head, and fell. âWhy donât they
let us give the rascals a volley,â said some of the men.
The left of our brigade, which was nearest them, now
opened a heavy fire; and by the time the line was all
formed, the French had taken to their heels. At this
moment a severe rain storm commenced, and darkened
the air so much that we lost sight of them completely;
when the sky cleared up, they were discovered, about
a mile forward, scrambling their way over hedge and
ditch without any regularity. The ground which they
had occupied now lay before us, strewed with the dead
and wounded; and the Portuguese regiment belonging
to our division were busy stripping them naked. In
this barbarous action, however, they were joined by
very few of the British. The division to our right and
left had by this time succeeded in turning the flanks of
the French army; and they were now retreating in
great confusion.

After waiting under arms for some time, we were
ordered to encamp on the ground we then occupied,
where we remained during that night.

[Pg 103]

FOOTNOTES:

[11]
Guarda lies on the top of a high hill; we were much fatigued
in ascending it, and entered the town with empty stomachs, but we
were agreeably surprised to find that the French had left their dinners
for us ready cooked, as in their haste they had left them on the fire
in the different houses where they had been lodged. In one house
where some of their officers were quartered, and had been obliged to
retreat from table, after it was laid for dinner, some wag placed
a muleâs head in the centre, with a label in its mouth on which was
written â
Pour Mons. Jean Bull

THE

WAR IN THE PENINSULA:

A CONTINUATION OF RECOLLECTIONS OF

THE EVENTFUL LIFE OF A SOLDIER.

CHAPTER I.

The night we passed in the encampment at Sabugal
was uncommonly dark, and at intervals the rain fell in
torrents; fires had been kindled in the hollow trunks
of some large chestnut trees, which, burning up as high
as the branches, illuminated them to the very top.
The flickering, lurid glare which these fiery columns
threw on the naked bodies of the slain, the indistinct
objects in the back ground, and the groups of soldiers
which flitted around them, presented a scene at once
sublime and picturesque; it looked like the midnight
orgies of some supernatural beings.

Next morning we fell in at daylight, and, in a short
time after, pursued our march by the same route the
French had taken the preceding day. The ground
was covered with gum cistus, which had been previously
burned, either through accident, or to serve
some purpose, among which they had left visible marks
of their confused flight, in the torn pieces of clothing
and broken arms which strewed their line of march.
They continued their retreat without halting until they
reached Ciudade Roderigo, a fortified town on the
Spanish frontier, at which place, having crossed the
Agueda, they made a stand and concentrated their
force. In consequence of this our army also halted,
[Pg 104]

and, in a few days after, our regiment was quartered
in a Portuguese village within some miles of them.

On the advance to this place, I became acquainted
with a lad of the name of Henry Gââ. While on
guard with him one day, I perceived him reading a
book, which, on inquiry, I found to be Cromekâs Remains
of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, which he had
borrowed from an officerâs servant. Books of any
kind were rare amongst us at that time, but one of this
description had too much nationality in it, not to be
considered a valuable prize in a foreign land. We
read the book together, and a similarity of feeling and
sentiment subsequently led to a friendship which continued
unimpaired while we remained in the Peninsula.
In his romantic turn of mind and acute sensibility, he
bore a strong resemblance to my former friend and
shipmate, William. He had read a great deal, but,
like myself, he had read with little discrimination. The
effects were nearly the same in both, a propensity to
day-dreaming and castle-building. Many a weary
mile have we travelled together, almost unconscious of
progression, charming the sense of hunger away by
anticipating our future honour and preferment, and in
forming romantic schemes of rural retirement, when
our campaigns were ended. This peculiarity of disposition,
although it might sometimes occasion us uneasiness,
where others, less sensitive, felt but little, yet, on
the whole, in a life like ours, where the scene was
continually shifting, it rendered our minds more elastic;
and the continual play of fancy which was thus excited,
diversified the lights and shadows so much, that
even now, I am at a loss to say, whether at that time
I felt more pain or pleasure. We had only been a few
days in quarters, when my friend Henry was near
being involved in an affair, the consequence of which
would have ruined a mind like his for ever. The captain
of his company was a man of a strange disposition,
which rendered him an object of dislike to both officers
and men. A fellow of infinite jest, he rarely spoke
but in a humorous strain; but there was âa laughing
[Pg 105]

devil in his sneer,â and, like the cat, when she has
secured her prey, he always felt most inclined to sport
with the individual on whose destruction he was bent.
It would be endless to enter into a detail of the methods
by which he tormented his company,âthose who served
under him will remember them well; suffice it to say, that
I have known many officers who possessed bad qualities,
but none who possessed fewer good ones than Captain S.

On the march, he was in the habit of riding his mule
among the ranks, very much to the annoyance of his
company, and one day during the previous advance,
the column was marching through fields which were
fenced in by broad thin stones. The other officers
finding they could not get through conveniently with
the regiment, had taken a lane to the right of the
column, but he continued to move on; finding, however,
that his mule could not get through the openings
made, he desired Henry to overturn one of the stones.
Henry made the attempt, but finding his strength inadequate
to the task, and seeing himself getting behind
the regiment, he passed through and rejoined his company.
The captain had now to take the same road
with the other officers. When he overtook the column,
foaming with rage, he commenced in a measured, affected
style, to abuse Henry, ending with his usual
phrase of encouragement, â
Iâll get you a sweet five hundred.
â
From that day forward, poor Henry was
marked out as a butt for his caprice and tyranny.
Not long after, two men of the company were ordered
to be confined on a charge of selling their necessaries,
one of whom happened to be Henryâs comrade, and
Captain Sââ thinking this a favourable opportunity
for carrying his promise into effect, ordered him to be
confined also. A court-martial was ordered, and the
prisoners warned for trial. Whether by some sinister
manÅuvreing, or that it fell his regular turn, Captain
Sââ was president.

The witnesses were examined; the evidence was
sufficiently clear against the other two, but none was
adduced against Henry.

[Pg 106]

The president, trusting, I suppose, to his influence
with the other members, proceeded (without taking any
notice of the total want of evidence against Henry) to
recommend the prisoners to acknowledge the crime
laid to their charge, and throw themselves on the mercy
of the court. Poor Henry was so struck with the
flagrant injustice of this proceeding, that he could
scarcely muster courage sufficient to say that he had
heard no evidence against him. The president did not
allow him to finish what he had to say, before he
opened on him with a string of the most abusive
epithets; and then, addressing himself to the members
of the courtââGentlemen,â said he, âthis is one of the
most insolent dogs in my company. You may take my
word for it, he is guiltyâhe confessed to me that he
was, before I confined him, which I can prove.â The
members sat mute, as is generally the case while under
the influence of a superior officerâs rhetoric; and Henry
had bade farewell to hope, when one of the officers,
who was but a young subaltern, bursting through the
blind deference too often cringingly paid to power,
even in matters where discipline is not concerned, and
giving way to the words which a natural love of justice
prompted,ââWe have no right, Captain Sââ,â said
he, âsitting here as we do, to try the case according to
the evidence laid before us, to presume that the prisoner
is guilty, in the absence of all evidence. Nor are
we entitled to pay attention to any representation
which you may feel inclined to make, prejudicial to his
character. Sitting where you do as president of this
courtâeither sufficient evidence must be produced
against the prisoner, or we are bound to acquit him.â

Captain Sââ turned the scowl of his dark grey eyes
upon him, wherein the disappointment of baffled revenge
and rage was distinctly visible: but the subaltern bore
the look intended for his annihilation with the utmost
indifferenceâthere even seemed to be a smile of
contempt playing on his countenance. Captain Sââ then
proceeded to bring forward evidence to prove
Henryâs connection with the crime for which the
[Pg 107]

prisoners were triedâprincipally for the purpose of
proving that he had confessed his guilt; and, according
to the presidentâs opinion, this evidence was perfectly
conclusive. The officer already mentioned, seeing that
Henry was nearly sinking under the influence of his
feelings, said, âDonât be afraid, my man, justice will be
done youâI believe you to be innocentâat least I
have heard nothing yet to induce me to think otherwise;
take time, collect yourself, and if you have any questions
to ask the evidence, or any witnesses to call in your
defence, to disprove what has been stated, speak
out fearlessly.â Encouraged by the officerâs kind and
manly conduct, and with his assistance, Henry cross-questioned
the evidence, and brought forward witnesses
that not only disproved all that had been stated against
him, but fixed a suspicion on the minds of those present,
that the president had not only confined him without
cause, but had suborned witnesses for the purpose of
bringing him to punishment. Captain Sââ seeing
that his designs were frustrated, sullenly gave up the
point, and poor Henry was acquitted: but had it not
been for the independent character of the officer above
mentioned, he might not have escaped punishment.
Courts-martial were at that time much too frequent to
expect that justice would be always administered impartially
by them; and I am sorry to say it was too often
evident that individual pique influenced the decisions.
In some regiments, indeed, courts-martial were resorted to
merely to give a colour to the proceedings of the officer
commanding, whose wishes were oftener consulted than
the ends of justice. This was not remedied by what
are called company courts-martial, where the individual
was tried by his peers; for I remember in one case,
where I was president, the point in agitation among
the members was not, âwhat punishment was adequate
to the crime?â but âwhat punishment would please the
commanding officer?â and I had some difficulty in convincing
them that the former was the point they had to
determine. The
surveillance
, established by the commander-in-chief
over courts-martial, was a wise measure,
[Pg 108]

and has altered matters very much. Indeed, too much
praise cannot be bestowed on His Royal Highness, for
the humane and effective policy which has been gradually
introduced into the army: the situation of the
soldier at present is very different from what it was
twenty years ago. From the specimen Henry had got
of Captain Sâââs disposition, he thought it the wisest
plan to get transferred from his company, which he
effected shortly after.

A few days after this occurrence, our regiment was
moved to the village of Fuentes de Honore, a few miles
nearer Almeida; great part of the way, we moved
through a wood of oak trees, in which the inhabitants
of the surrounding villages had herds of swine feeding:
here the voice of the cuckoo never was mute; night and
day its simple notes were heard in every quarter of the
wood.

The village we now occupied was in Spain, and
formed a striking contrast to those of Portugal; the
inhabitants and their houses wore an air of neatness,
cleanliness, and comfort about them, unlike anything
we had as yet seen in the country; their dress and
language were also different.

The site of the village itself was beautiful and
romantic; it lay in a sort of ravine, down which a
small river brawled over an irregular rocky bed, in
some places forming precipitous falls of many feet;
the acclivity on each side was occasionally abrupt,
covered with trees and thick brushwood. Three
leagues to the left of our front lay the villages of
Gallegos and Espeja, in and about which our light
division and cavalry were quartered. Between this and
Fuentes lay a large wood, which, receding on the
right, formed a plain, flanked by a deep ravine, being
a continuation of that in which the village lay; in our
rear was another plain, (on which our army subsequently
formed,) and behind that, in a valley, Villa Fermosa,
the river Coa running past it.

We had not been many days here, when we received
intelligence that the light troops were falling back upon
[Pg 109]

our village, the enemy having re-crossed the Agueda in
great force, for the purpose of relieving Almeida, which
we had blockaded. On the morning we received this
intelligence, (the 3d of May, 1811,) our regiment turned
out of the town, and took up their position with the
rest of the division on a plain, some distance behind it.
The morning was uncommonly beautiful, the sun shone
bright and warm, the various odoriferous shrubs, which
were scattered profusely around, perfumed the air, and
the woods rang with the songs of birds. The light
division and cavalry falling back, followed by the
columns of the French, the various divisions of the
army assembling on the plain from different quarters,
their arms glittering in the sun, bugles blowing, drums
beating, the various staff-officers galloping about to
different parts of the line giving orders, formed a scene
which realised to my mind all that I had ever read of
feats of arms, or the pomp of war; a scene which no
one could behold unmoved, or without feeling a portion
of that enthusiasm which always accompanies âdeeds
of high daring;â a scene justly conceived and well
described by Moore, in the beautiful songâ

âOh the sight entrancing,

When morningâs beam is glancing

Oâer files arrayâd,

With helm and blade,

And plumes in the gay wind dancing.â

Our position was now taken up in such a way, that
our line ran along the frontiers of Portugal, maintaining
the blockade of Almeida by our left, while our right
kept open the communication with Sabugal, the place
where the last action was fought.

The French advanced on our position in three
columns, about three oâclock in the afternoon, and
detached a strong body of troops against Fuentes,
which was at this time occupied as an advanced post
by the 60th regiment, and the light company of our
division. The skirmishers were covered in their
advance by cavalry, in consequence of which ours
were obliged to fall back, for greater safety, to some
[Pg 110]

stone fences on the outskirts of the village, while a
party of our German hussars covered their retreat.
The cavalry now commenced skirmishing, the infantry
keeping up an occasional fire. It was rather
remarkable that the cavalry on both sides happened
to be Germans. When this was understood, volleys
of insulting language, as well as shot, were exchanged
between them. One of our hussars got so enraged
at something one of his opponents said, that raising
his sword, he dashed forward upon him into the very
centre of their line. The French hussar, seeing that
he had no mercy to expect from his enraged foe, wheeled
about his horse, and rode to the rear; the other, determined
on revenge, still continued to follow him. The
whole attention of both sides was drawn for a moment
to these two, and a temporary cessation of firing took
place; the French staring in astonishment at our
hussarâs temerity, while our men were cheering on.
The chase continued for some way to the rear of their
cavalry. At last our hussar coming up with him, and
fetching a furious blow, brought him to the ground.
Awakening now to a sense of the danger he had thrown
himself into, he set his horse at full speed to get back
to his comrades; but the French, who were confounded
when he passed, had recovered their surprise, and
determined on revenging the death of their comrade;
they joined in pursuit, firing their pistols at him. The
poor fellow was now in a hazardous plight, they were
every moment gaining upon him, and he had still a
long way to ride. A band of the enemy took a circuit,
for the purpose of intercepting him; and before he
could reach the line he was surrounded, and would
have been cut in pieces, had not a party of his comrades,
stimulated by the wish to save so brave a fellow,
rushed forward, and just arrived in time, by making
the attack general, to save his life, and brought him off
in triumph.

The overwhelming force which the French now
pushed forward on the village, could not be withstood
by the small number of troops which defended it; they
[Pg 111]

were obliged to give way, and were fairly forced to a
rising ground on the other side, where stood a small
chapel. The French now thought they had gained
their point, but they were soon undeceived; for being
reinforced at this place by the Portuguese caÃ§adores,
our lads came to the right about, and attacked them
with such vigour, that in a short time they were driven
back to their old ground. While retreating through
the town, one of our sergeants who had run up the
wrong street, being pushed hard by the enemy, ran
into one of the houses; they were close at his heels,
and he had just time to tumble himself into a large
chest, and let the lid down, when they entered and
commenced plundering the house, expressing their
wonder at the same time concerning the sudden disappearance
of the âAngloisâ whom they had seen
run into the house. During the time, the poor sergeant
lay sweating, and half smothered, they were
busy breaking up every thing that came in their way,
looking for plunder; and they were in the act of opening
the lid of his hiding place, when the noise of our
men cheering, as they charged the enemy through the
town, forced them to take to flight. He now got out,
and having joined his company, assisted in driving the
French back. No other part of the line had as yet
been attacked by the French; they seemed bent on
taking the village of Fuentes in the first place, as a
âstepping stone,â and the main body of each army lay
looking at each other. Finding that the force they had
sent down, great as it was, could not keep possession
of the place, they sent forward two strong bodies of
fresh troops to retake it, one of which, composed of the
Irish legion, dressed in red uniform, was at first taken
for a British regiment, and they had time to form up
and give us a volley before the mistake was discovered.
The village was now vigorously attacked by the enemy
at two points, and with such a superior force, that in
spite of the unparalleled bravery of our troops, they
were driven back contesting every inch of the ground.

On our retreat through the village, we were met by
[Pg 112]

the 71st regiment, cheering, led on by Colonel Cadogan;
which had been detached from the line to our support.
The chase was now turned, and although the French
were obstinately intent on keeping their ground, and
so eager, that many of their cavalry had entered the
town, and rushed furiously down the streets, all
their efforts were in vain: nothing could withstand
the charge of the gallant 71st; and in a
short time, in spite of all resistance, they cleared the
village. This regiment during the Peninsular war, was
always remarkable for its gallantry. The brave
Cadogan well knew the art of rendering his men
invincible; he knew that the courage of the British
soldier is best called forth by associating it with his
country, and he also knew how to time the few words
which produced such magical effects. We were now
once more in possession of the place, but our loss, as
well as that of the French, had been very great.

In particular places of the village, where a stand
had been made, or the shot brought to bear, the slaughter
had been immense, which was the case near the river,
and at the small chapel on our side of the town;
among the rest lay one poor fellow of the 88th light
company, who had been severely wounded, and seemed
to suffer excruciating agony, for he begged of those
who passed him to put him out of torture. Although
from the nature of his wound there was no possibility
of his surviving, yet none felt inclined to comply with
his request, until a German of the 60th rifle battalion,
after hesitating a few moments, raised his rifle, and
putting the muzzle of it to his head fired the contents
of it through it. Whether this deed deserved praise or
blame, I leave others to determine. The French,
enraged at being thus baffled in all their attempts to
take the town, sent forward a force composed of the
very flower of their army; but they gained only a
temporary advantage, for being reinforced by the 79th
regiment, although the contest remained doubtful until
night, we remained in possession of it, with the exception
of a few houses on the rise of the hill at the French side.

[Pg 113]

The light brigade of our division was now withdrawn,
and the 71st and 79th regiments remained as a picquet
in it during the night; next morning it was again
occupied as before. On the fourth, both sides were
busily employed burying the dead and bringing in
the wounded; French and English promiscuously
mixed, and assisted each other in that melancholy
duty as if they had been intimate friends. So far did
this friendship extend, that two of our lads who spoke
French, went up that night after dark to the enemyâs
picquet, and having conversed and drank wine with
them, returned unmolested to their company. During
this day the French Generals reconnoitered our position,
and next morning, (the fifth), they made a movement
to their left with two strong columns; this caused a
corresponding movement in our line, and it was
scarcely made, when they attacked our right, composed
of the seventh division, with all their cavalry, and
succeeded in turning it; but they were gallantly met
by some squadrons of our dragoons, and repulsed.
Their columns of infantry still continued to advance on
the same point, and were much galled by the heavy fire
kept up on them by the seventh division; but in consequence
of this movement, our communication with
Sabugal was abandoned for a stronger position, and our
army was now formed in two lines, the light division
and cavalry in reserve, this manÅuvre paralyzed their
attack on our line, and their efforts were now chiefly
confined to partial cannonading, and some charges with
their cavalry, which were received and repulsed by the
picquets of the first division in one instance; but as they
were falling back, they did not perceive the charge of
a different body in time to form, and many of them
were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners. Colonel
Hill, who commanded the picquets, was among the
latter; the 42d regiment also, under Lord Blantyre,
gallantly repulsed another charge made by the
enemyâs cavalry. The French then attempted to
push a strong body of light infantry down the
ravine to the right of the first division, but they
[Pg 114]

were driven back by some companies of the guards
and 95th rifles.

While on the right this was going on, the village of
Fuentes was again attacked by a body of the imperial
guard, and, as on the third, the village was taken and
retaken several times. At one time they had brought
down such an overwhelming force, that our troops
were fairly beat out of the town, and the French
formed close column between it and us; some guns
which were posted on the rise in front of our line,
having opened upon them, made them change their
ground; and the 88th regiment (Connaught Rangers)
being detached from our division, led on by the
heroic General MâKinnon, (who commanded our
right brigade,) charged them furiously, and drove them
back through the village with great slaughter. Some
time previous to this, General Picton had had occasion
to check this regiment for some plundering affair they
had been guilty of, and he was so offended at their
conduct, that in addressing them, he had told them
they were the greatest blackguards in the army;âbut
as he was always as ready to give praise as censure,
where it was due, when they were returning from this
gallant and effective charge, he exclaimed, âWell done
the brave 88th!â Some of them, who had been stung
at his former reproaches, cried out, âAre we the greatest
blackguards in the army now?â The valiant
Picton smiled, and replied, âNo, no, you are brave
and gallant soldiers; this day has redeemed your
character.â

At one time during the contest, when the enemy had
gained a partial possession of the village, our light
troops had retired into a small wood above it, where
they were huddled together without any regularity; a
French officer, while leading on his men, having been
killed in our front, a bugler of the 83d regiment starting
out between the fire of both parties, seized his gold
watch; but he had scarcely returned, when a cannon
shot from the enemy came whistling past him, and he
fell lifeless on the spot. The blood started out of his
[Pg 115]

nose and ears, but with the exception of this, there was
neither wound nor bruise on his body; the shot had
not touched him. The phenomenon here described
has been the subject of much discussion among medical
men, some attributing it to the shot becoming electrical
and parting with its electricity in passing the body;
while others maintain, that the ball does strike the
individual obliquely, and although there is no appearance
of injury on the surface, there always exists
serious derangement of the system internally.

We had regained possession of the village a short
time after, and got a little breathing time; a few of
our lads and some of the 79th were standing together,
where a poor fellow lay a few paces from them weltering
in his blood. As he belonged to the 79th, they
went over to see who he was; the ball had entered the
centre of his forehead, and passed through his brain,
and to all appearance he was completely dead; but
when any of the flies which were buzzing about the
wound, entered it, a convulsive tremor shook his whole
body, and the muscles of his face became frightfully
distorted; there could scarcely be imagined anything
more distressing, or more appalling to the spectator.

Within the walls of the old chapel, where our men
and the French had got under cover alternately, as
they were pursuing or pursued, there lay a mixture
of various nations, wounded, dying, and dead, and
presented a sight which no language could describe,
raving, groaning, calling for assistance and drink.
He must have had a hardened heart who could have
beheld it without feeling deeply. One noble-looking
fellow of the imperial guard lay wounded through
both legs, and one of his arms shattered; he had been
plundered and stripped half naked. One of our
light company, of the name of James Cochran, as
much distinguished for bravery in the field as for a
mild and humane temper, (for they are not incompatible,)
seeing the poor fellow lying in this plight, unable
to help himself, and the flies irritating his woundsâthrew
his own blanket over himâbrought some
[Pg 116]

water, and left it and some bread with him; but what
was his mortification on returning that way, to find
that he was again plundered of all, and left as before.
The poor fellow, however, seemed to feel the most
lively gratitude for what Cochran had done, and
wished to force some money on him, which had escaped
the search of his plunderers.

After the various taking and retaking of the village,
night again found us in possession of it. On the 6th
no attempt was made to renew the attack, and, as on
the 4th, the army on each side were employed in
burying the dead, and looking after the wounded. On
the 7th we still remained quiet; but on this day the
whole French army were reviewed on the plain by
Massena. On the night of the 7th, some companies of
our regiment were detached on picquet to the ravine on
the left of the town, and during the night I was placed
one of the outpost sentries. The French picquets
occupied the opposite side, and the distance between
us was but trifling. The night was very dark, and
the place where I was posted was amongst bushes and
trees, near the riverâs edge. All was still save the
river gurgling over its rocky bed, or when a slight
breeze set the leaves in motion, and the
qui vive
of the
French sentinels could be distinctly heard.

I had been some time posted, ruminating on the
awful responsibility attached to my post, as it was
probable the enemy might make an attack during the
night. I was straining my eyes through the thick
darkness towards the spot where I imagined the French
sentry was placed, at the same time eagerly listening.
In the midst of this anxiety I was alarmed by the
noise of something rustling among the bushes near the
river. The thought struck me instantly that it must
be the French picquet advancing on my post; my first
impulse was to fire in the direction of the noise, but I
recollected that there was a possibility of giving a false
alarm, and I felt myself in a strange dilemmaâI could
not fire until I ascertained that it was an enemy, and
before that could be done I might be surprised and
[Pg 117]

killed. The noise ceased, but still I was all attention,
for this did not give me confidence; sticking my ramrod
in the ground, I put my ear to it, but could hear
nothing. I now assumed more courage, and almost
persuaded myself I had been deceived. At that
moment, a burst through the bushes in my front,
accompanied by a horrid yell, robbed me of all presence
of mind. In the desperation which fear sometimes
inspires, I dashed forward against the object of my
alarm with my charged bayonet, and plunged it in the
foe; he fell, and for a few seconds I had not power to
move. Silence was now only broken by the smothered
groan of my dying victim; and recovering myself a
little, I stooped to ascertain whether it was really a
French grenadier I had slain, but found it was only a
poor assâs colt which had strayed from its dam, and
browsing about had thus been the unconscious cause
of my alarm.

On the 8th the French sentries were withdrawn at
day light, the main body of the enemy having retired
during the night, to the woods between Fuentes and
Gallejos. On the 9th they broke up, and retired from
their position; and on the 10th they had re-crossed the
Agueda without having accomplished the relief of
Almeida. On the morning of the 11th, however,
about one oâclock
A.M.
, the garrison having blown up
part of the fortifications, made their escape past the
troops who had blockaded them, in consequence of the
darkness of the nightâsome said the carelessness of
the regiments on that duty. One regiment in particular
was blamed, but the excuse might be more properly
sought for in the masterly dispositions which
the governor (General Brenier) had made, both for
the escape of the garrison, and the subsequent retreat.

CHAPTER II.

We were again quartered in Fuentes, but the place
was sadly altered; the inhabitants had fled, many of
[Pg 118]

the houses were destroyed, and all of them plundered;
although the dead had been in general buried, there
still remained some bodies lying about swelled and
blackened by the heat of the sun; the ground was
strewed with uniform caps and clothing, and the streets
were dyed with the blood of the combatants; the whole
place wore an air of desolation and wretchedness. We
were only a few days there when we received orders
to march along with the 7th division, for the purpose
of laying siege to Badajos, a fortified town on the
Spanish frontier, in the province of Estremadura.
The distance between Fuentes and Badajos might be
about 40 leagues, Portuguese, (150 miles;) we proceeded
by Alfeyates, Penamacore, and Castello Branco,
where we were quartered in a Franciscan convent for
two days. From thence we marched to Villa Valhe,
where boats were ready for us to cross the Tagus.
This was a romantic spot: the side on which we lay
previous to passing was a plain, the opposite one a
mountain, which rose abrupt and precipitous, clothed
with trees and bushes to the top, throwing its dark
shade on the bosom of the river which rolled along at
its base, deep, dark, and rapid. Here it was reported
Lord Wellington had lost his two orderly dragoons
some days before. He had received information that
the French army under Marshal Soult was coming
down in great force on Beresfordâs army, and he was
so anxious to get forward, that when he came to the
river, and found the bridge of boats not thrown across,
he plunged in followed by his orderly dragoons, (certainly
a most hazardous attempt;) the current was so
strong that the dragoons with their horses were carried
away and drowned, his lordship only escaping by the
superior strength of his horse.

Having crossed the river, we proceeded by a winding
road cut in the face of a hill to Niza; this was a
most distressing march, being up hill the whole way.
Passing Alpalhao, we reached Porto Legre two days
after. From this we marched to Arronches, and
from thence to Campo Mayor, situated about ten miles
[Pg 119]

from Badajos, where we remained for some days,
while preparations were making for the siege. This
was a very handsome town, walled, but very slightly
fortified; one building in particular, a small chapel,
called Capella des Osses, is worth noticing. It had
been erected to commemorate some massacre. The
whole interior was built up with skulls and thigh
bones, laid across, and two skeletons, one on each side,
were built into the wall.

On the 25th of May we marched towards Badajos,
which the French had gained possession of in the
beginning of the campaign, through the treachery of
the Spanish governor, at the very time Lord Wellington
had promised relief, and given orders to hold out.
When we first came in sight of the town, its spires
appeared above the hill which rises on the Campo
Mayor side of it, as if the town lay immediately beneath,
but we found it was still a great way off; we then
took a circuitous route to the left of the town, and
having crossed the Guidiana, we encamped about three
miles from it, on the slope of a small hill which skirted
the Elvas road; here we constructed huts in the best
manner we could, with bushes and branches of trees.

On the night of the 29th, the stores and ordnance
having arrived, we marched down towards the town,
for the purpose of breaking ground: it was fortunately
very dark, and as we kept the greatest silence, the
French were not aware of our approach. When we
reached the place where it was intended we should
open the trenches, we formed a line across the front of
the town, where two thousand intrenching tools had
been laid. We were then told our safety depended on
expedition, for if the French discovered our presence
before we had worked ourselves under cover, a warm
salute might be expected. The officers were dependent
on our exertions for safety; and it was remarked in
what kind and familiar tones some of those spoke, who,
in greater security, would have acted the blustering
tyrant. I cannot understand what makes many officers
so supercilious, haughty, and morose to their men,
[Pg 120]

when, by a little good humour, or friendly feeling displayed,
I have no doubt they might not only make
themselves beloved, but have their orders much better
obeyed.

We now commenced work vigorously, and in six
hours were under cover, without the French having
discovered our presence. The operations of the siege
were now carried on with great vigour on both sides
of the river Guidiana; the opposite one was conducted
by the seventh division against fort St Christoval, an
outwork that protected the advance to the bridge. By
the second of June we had two batteries playing on the
walls, and four were opened by the seventh division on
fort St Christoval. The guns were partly served by
Portuguese artillery, who behaved extremely well.
The troops were told off in two parties, relieving each
other every twenty-four hours.

A communication was kept up between the several
trenches, and a covered way formed, which prevented
the men from being so much exposed in going to, and
returning from the camp; but still we suffered severely
from the enemyâs shot and shell, with which they now
plied us hotly, having their guns constantly ready to
fire at even a single individual if he put his head above
the trench; and the shells fired from the garrison were
thrown so as to make them fall in it. At night we
could see them by the fusee, and were often enabled to
get out of their way; in the day, we ran more risk, although
we could still distinguish them from shot, by
the whistling sound they made coming through the air.

The second or third night after the trenches were
opened, Dennis and I were down on the working party.
Captain Sââ, already mentioned, was one of the
officers. They were telling off a covering party, who
were to go out in front, to prevent any sudden surprise
by the enemy making a sortie, when the word âshell!â
was given. All eyes were instantly turned on it,
watching its direction, that they might run in the
opposite one. Captain Sââ, although so valiant on
parade, seemed to have no predilection for a âglorious
[Pg 121]

deathâ more than his neighbours; and he, in company
with a brother captain, headed the retreat. They had
not gone many paces, when notice was given of another
shell falling in the direction they were running. By
this time the first had fallen short of the trench, and a
retrograde movement took place; but the captains
were now in a bad plight, for the crowd was so condensed
in the direction they had to go, that there was
no getting through. The shell was giving intelligence
by its quickened revolutions, that it was falling, but
there was no means of escape, the whole were fairly
wedged in and had fallen on each other; and had the
shell burst among them, it would have made dreadful
havoc. As I threw myself down by the side of the
trench, I perceived Captain Sââ running about like
a chicken in a coop, seeking an opening by which he
might escape, but finding none he wormed his head into
the crowd, which had fallen in his front, and thus remained.
The shell fell in a direction that placed me
in imminent danger; but I could not refrain from
laughing at his ludicrous position; it burst, however,
without doing any injury.

On one occasion, when Dennis and I were on duty
in the trench, and at one of the batteries with some
others, at the formation of an embrasure, we had nearly
completed it, but it still required opening and facing off
towards the enemy; this was a very hazardous business,
as we were sure of a volley of cannon shot, the moment
we mounted the parapet. âCome, my brave fellows,â
said the superintending engineer officer, âwhich of
you will volunteer to go outside, and form the embrasure?â
Dennis and I were standing close by him, and
jumped upon the top of the breastwork. We were followed
by two more, but had scarcely appeared, when a
cannon shot striking the parapet close where I stood,
covered me with earth. âNever mind,â said Dennis, âto
miss is as good as a mile,â He scarcely had finished,
when he was served in the same mannerâno way
dispirited, he exclaimed, âTime about is fair play.â One
of the lads who worked with us began to show symptoms
[Pg 122]

of fear. âDonât be afraid,â said Dennis, âyouâll never
die till your time come.â His eloquence did not seem
to take effect. âGo into the trench,â said Dennis, âwe
will do without you.â The lad was in the act of doing
so, when a shot struck him, and he fell mortally
wounded. Soon after, our dinners having come down,
we were relieved by others and called in. The mess I
belonged to had sat down round the camp kettle, and
were beginning to help themselves, when the cry âshell!â
was given; all were to their feet in an instant, for we
found by the noise that it was coming in our direction.
The others endeavoured to make their escape; whether
from a belief in Dennisâs doctrine of predestination, I
cannot at present recollect, but instead of running from
it, I threw myself down flat in the embrasure. I had
scarcely done so, when the shell fell within two yards
of me. âNow,â thought I, âthere is no chance of
escape,â and during the few seconds of suspense, while
the last part of the fusee was whizzing in my ear, reflections
which would have occupied an hour at another
time, on home, parents, death, and my future fate,
whirled through my mind, like a wild and giddy
dream. The shell burst, and for a few moments I was
bereaved of recollection. Coming to myself, I scrambled
out from amongst the stuff with which I was covered.
âAre you kilt?â asked Dennis, running up to me with
an expression of real concern: looking to myself to see
whether I was wounded, I replied, âNo;â but I had
been well frightened. âThatâs right, my boy,â said he,
âI donât believe the shotâs made that will kill any of
us. Manyâs the long yarn about this business Iâll be
after telling to the ould women of Ireland yet.â

On the sixth, the breach in fort St Christoval being
considered practicable, a detachment of the different
regiments composing the seventh division was selected
to storm it: being at night we could not see the attack
farther than the flash of their fire-arms, which, from
our encampment, looked like an exhibition of fire
works; but we understood that from the nature of the
impediments thrown in our way, although they had
[Pg 123]

advanced under a heavy discharge of shot and shell
from the town, and musketry and hand grenades from
the garrison, they were unable to succeed, and were
ordered to retire. The firing was continued upon the
breach for three days longer, and a second attempt was
made to carry it on the evening of the ninth, with
another detachment of the seventh division. The
attack was made with the utmost gallantry, and they
advanced intrepidly to the foot of the breach; but the
same obstacles presented themselves as on the first
attempt, and after having suffered most severely,
without being able to effect a lodgment, they were
again ordered to retire. The loss in officers and men
was considerable.

The men of our division, unaccustomed to failure in
any enterprise, and perhaps rather conceited, were
inclined to attribute the failure of these attempts to the
troops composing the seventh division being mostly
foreigners; but in this opinion it is likely they were
wrong, as in the subsequent storming of the town, in
the ensuing year, the obstacles thrown in the way
were sufficient to resist even the bravest British troops.
A day or two after this affair, intelligence having been
received that Soult was advancing with a large army,
for the purpose of relieving Badajos, Wellington
deemed it prudent to raise the siege, converting it into
a blockade. From this until the seventeenth we were
busy withdrawing the guns and stores, which were
sent to the garrison of Elvas, as a place of security,
and on the seventeenth quitted our investment of the
place, and withdrew to Campo Mayor. On the morning
we left it, the French cavalry were out skirmishing
with a party of the eleventh hussars, who were covering
our retreat, and followed us the greater part of the
way.

While in Campo Mayor, where we remained for
some time, a German of the sixtieth regiment, a
Frenchman, and two Italians, belonging to the Chasseurs
Britannique, were shot for desertion,âthe former
belonging to our division, the latter three to the
[Pg 124]

seventh. On the morning that the sentence of the
first was carried into execution, the division was
assembled outside of the town, where they formed three
sides of a square. The prisoner was marched past the
various regiments, accompanied by the chaplain of the
division, and the guard appointed to shoot him. When
his devotions were finished, he was blindfolded by the
provost marshal, and placed kneeling on the brink of
his grave already open to receive him. He gave the
signal, and the next moment he fell pierced by half a
dozen musket balls. The different regiments then
marched past the body, receiving the word âeyes leftâ
as they past him.

I was on the general provost guard, the evening
previous to those of the seventh division being shot.
The sergeants came with the companyâs books to settle
their accounts; the two Italians were in paroxysms of
agony, crying and wringing their hands. The behaviour
of the Frenchman, who had been taken prisoner,
had volunteered into the Chasseurs Britannique, and
afterwards deserted from them to his countrymen,
formed a strong contrast to that of the others. Calm
and dignified, he seemed to feel no fear of death, nor
did any complaint pass his lips, save an occasional
exclamation against the injustice of trying him as a
deserter, being a Frenchman. In his circumstances,
he argued it was natural that he should endeavour to
join his friends the first opportunity that offered.
When the sergeant was settling their accounts, the
Italians paid no attention to anything said to them;
but he discussed every item with the greatest exactness,
and the sergeant wanting a small coin about the value
of a farthing to balance, he desired him to procure it
before he would sign the ledger; but though thus
exact with the sergeant, the moment he received his
balance, which amounted to some dollars, he divided
every penny of it amongst his fellow-prisoners. When
the Italians received their money, they sent for brandy,
and began to drink intemperately, endeavouring to
drown their sorrows and sear their minds; but it had
[Pg 125]

quite a different effect, for they then broke from all
restraint in the expression of their feelings, and cried
and groaned with agony in such a manner, that they
could be heard at a considerable distance from the
guard-room. In this state they continued until morning,
when they ceased their lamentations, only because
nature was exhausted by their former violence. Quite
different was the conduct of the Frenchman: when the
brandy was procured, the Italians pressed him to take
some, but he thanked them, and refused, âNo,â said
he, throwing a look of mingled pity and contempt on
them, âI need no brandy to enable me to face death.â
He continued to walk about with his arms folded
during the whole evening, without seeming in the
least disturbed; occasionally, indeed, his countenance
softened, and a tear-drop gathered in his eye, but it
was not permitted to linger there; and as if ashamed
of showing the least want of firmness, he assumed redoubled
inflexibility of countenance.

I could not help admiring his manly fortitude and
courage. I had no opportunity of speaking to him,
without being intrusive; but in silence I watched the
expression of his face, with a feeling I could hardly
describe. It was reported that he was a brother of
Marshal Soult: the truth of this I cannot pretend to
affirm. He was, however, certainly a man of a noble
mind and independent spirit. About midnight he lay
down and slept soundly until near the hour of execution;
his courage seemed to be now even more exalted.
He cleaned himself with the greatest nicety, conversed
with his fellow-prisoners cheerfully, and endeavoured,
although without success, to infuse some courage into
the poor Italians. The guard having arrived, he took
leave of those prisoners who were confined with him;
and to one, with whom he was more familiar than the
others, he gave some private injunction, and on parting
with him he said emphatically, âRemember, I die a
Frenchman.â He marched off to the place of execution
with the same collected intrepidity he had before
evinced, and I understood afterwards, that his demeanour
[Pg 126]

on the ground where he was shot, was similar to
that displayed while a prisoner. All admired his
courage, and were sorry for his fate.

CHAPTER III.

Leaving Campo Mayor we returned by the same route
that we had come, re-crossing the Tagus at Ville Valhe,
and halting at Albergeria, a village near the place from
whence we had first set out to go to Badajos, and not
far distant from Ciudade Roderigo, in which the French
had a garrison. We remained here in camp for some
time, very busy making fascions and gabions to fortify
the position which our army had taken. While we lay
in this encampment the weather was uncommonly
warm, and the bushes and long grass, among which we
had raised temporary huts, were rendered inflammable
as tinder; the grass on our left had been by accident
set fire to, and the flames soon spread in every direction.
The whole of the soldiers were turned out to
stop its progress; but in spite of their endeavours, it
communicated to a wood which lay on the face of a
steep hill in our rear, burning with the greatest fury.
The night happened to be very dark, and there could
scarcely be anything more grand or awful: the whole
mountain was in a blaze of fire, and the noise and
crackling of the trees burning was like the noise of a
hurricane; it was a scene which a person could stand
and gaze at it in mute astonishment, without being able
to define the sensations which were raised in his mind.
The wind fortunately carried the fire to the rear of our
encampment, or it might have been productive of great
injury, by blowing up the ammunition, &c.

From this place we removed more in advance to
Robleda, a Spanish village. The people seemed to be
comfortable, the houses were extremely clean, and here
we had a fair specimen of the manners of the Spanish
peasantry. All their domestic concerns were conducted
with the greatest regularity: they were very punctual in
[Pg 127]

the observance of all the rites of their church, and in
catechising their children. They seemed to me to be
really pious, and from their prudent, industrious habits,
happy and contented. The people I was quartered on
were uncommonly friendly; being able to speak the
language a little, and Dennis being of the same
religious persuasion, we were almost considered as members
of the family. The inhabitants were mostly all
employed in agriculture, and were very lively and fond
of amusement, particularly of singing and dancing;
here they had their fondangos and boleras every
Sunday evening after mass, dressed in the gay and
becoming fashion of their country, and many a ditty
was chaunted in praise of General Mina and Don
Julian. The village, however, proved very unhealthy:
during the short time we were in it, eighty or ninety of
our men left us to go to the rear sick, most of them
with fever and ague, and among the number my poor
friend Dennis.

On the 24th September, in consequence of the
advance of the French, we were ordered to march
from this to El-Bodon; and it was with unfeigned
regret on both sides, I believe, that we parted with our
friendly hosts.

On the 25th, at two oâclock in the morning, we
were turned out to the heights above the town, which
our brigade, along with one of cavalry, occupied. Our
position was on a range of heights, over which passed
the road leading from Roderigo to Fuente Guinaldo.
Here we lay under arms until about eight oâclock
in the morning, when we perceived, issuing out of
Roderigo, one column of cavalry after another advancing
along the road towards our post, to the amount of
about forty squadrons; these were succeeded by twelve
or fourteen battalions of infantry, with twelve piece of
cannon. Our situation now began to get precarious,
being completely separated from the rest of the army,
by at least six miles. Still we had no orders to retreatâand
to retreat without orders is not the custom of the
British army.

[Pg 128]

One of the regiments was posted on the hill over
which the road passed, and when it was seen that the
French were bent upon advancing in that direction,
two more regiments, the 77th British, 21st Portuguese,
and the brigade of cavalry, were sent to reinforce
them.

This was scarcely done, when the advanced squadrons
of the enemyâs cavalry and artillery made a furious
attack on this post, and succeeded in taking two piece
of Portuguese cannon. The Portuguese artillery
behaved bravely, having stood until actually cut down
at their guns, which were posted on a rising ground to
the right. The 5th regiment was now ordered to
charge, and they succeeded in retaking the guns.
While this was going on on the right, we were attacked
by another body of cavalry in front, which was met
and repulsed with determined bravery by the 77th
regiment. Our cavalry also were warmly engaged,
and charged different bodies of the enemy which
ascended on the left. Here we kept our post gallantly,
surrounded by about two thousand cavalryâuntil at
last the French infantry being brought up, we were
ordered to retreat in squares on Fuente Guinaldo,
supported only by the small body of cavalry already
mentioned. The French cavalry seeing us preparing
for retreat, rushed furiously on, and the various squares
were now successively charged by powerful masses of
their cavalry, one in particular on three faces of the
square, but they halted, and repulsed them with the
utmost steadiness and gallantry. The French in those
charges suffered severely, having a tremendous fire
poured in on them each time. As they rushed on
with impetuosity, when they were brought to a dead
stop by the points of our bayonets, they were thrown
into the greatest confusion, and were brought down
by our shot in numbers. The whole now proceeded
to retreat in excellent order, at an ordinary pace,
keeping exact distances, ready to form up in the event
of a charge being made.

We were much annoyed by shot and shell from the
[Pg 129]

heights where the French artillery were posted, some
of which falling in the squares did great mischief,
killing and wounding several of our men, and blowing
up our ammunition. We had about six miles to retreat
in this manner before we reached the body of the
army, with the French cavalry hanging on our flanks
and rear, some of whom had even the audacity to ride
to our front, and having taken part of our baggage,
brought it back close past our columns: we could
render no assistance, as our own safety wholly depended
on keeping ourselves ready to form square. Here
General Picton showed that coolness and intrepidity
for which he was so much distinguished; for some
time he rode at the head of our square, while a strong
body of French hung on our right, waiting a favourable
opportunity to charge. The captain who commanded
us (both field officers being sick) was throwing many
a fearful glance at them, and was rather in a state of
perturbationââNever mind the French,â said Picton,
âmind your regiment; if the fellows come here, we
will give them a warm reception.â

At length we came in sight of the rest of our army,
and the main body of the French hung back, but we
were escorted into the very lines by their advanced
guard. Here, however, they met with a warm reception
from some squadrons of our cavalry, which made
them retreat. We halted in rear of Fuente Guinaldo,
where an intrenched camp had been formed, and remained
here that night and next day, during which
the French, having brought forward their infantry,
took post on a hill opposite, and we expected an
engagement; but Lord Wellington, for good reasons,
no doubt, deemed it more prudent to retire. When
night came, we were ordered to kindle a great number
of fires, for the purpose of making the French believe
we still remained in our encampment. Two hours
after, we commenced our retreat, leaving the fires
burning brightly, and marched all night; the road we
travelled was uncommonly narrow, and various impediments
in the way often caused the rear to halt.
[Pg 130]

The fatigue we had undergone the preceding two or
three days, and the almost total want of sleep during
that time, completely overcame us; the moment a
halt was made, we dropped down on the ground fast
asleep, and it was by the greatest exertion that we
were able to rouse ourselves to proceed. So overpowering
was its effects, that I would have been content
to be taken prisoner, or even to suffer death, I dare
say, had it been the alternative, had I been allowed to
sleep. Indeed, some of the men could not resist its
effects, and stepping aside off the road, threw themselves
down, and yielded to its influence, although
certain of being taken by the enemy, which they
accordingly were. Next day we halted in a meadow,
where, having our rations served out, we proceeded on
to a village, near which our light division and cavalry
had a severe skirmish with the French, whom they
repulsed. The enemy then retreated to their old
position, and we were quartered in a Portuguese
village, on the frontiers, within a few leagues of Roderigo,
where we remained until January, 1812. This
was a miserable, dirty place, with a few poor wretched
inhabitants in it. It was designated by the soldiers,
the âHungry Village;â as, to answer some purpose
which we were then unacquainted with, we had
only half rations during the greater part of the time
we were in it; to add to the rest, the officer in temporary
command of the regiment at that time, was
ignorant of his duty, which, in conjunction with a
naturally cruel and vindictive disposition, bade fair to
ruin the regiment in the few months he had the command
of it. I shall not trace his pedigree to the low
origin from whence he sprung, because, had he been a
good man, it would only have enhanced his merit; nor
shall I particularize the deformity of his person, which
he could not help; but there will be no harm in giving
a specimen of his mode of discipline while in command
of the regiment, particularly as it forms a strong contrast
to that of an officer whom I shall have occasion
to mention in the course of this narrative.

[Pg 131]

Having neither the education nor the breeding of a
gentleman, he felt jealous in the company of the officers,
and lived in a retired and sullen manner. He generally
passed his time in gossiping with his barber or
his cook, or indeed any of the men, with an affectation
of entering into all their concerns. By this and eavesdropping
he became acquainted with little circumstances
which another commanding officer would have disdained
to listen to, and which he always made a bad use
of. The full extent of his malevolent disposition was
not known, however, until he got command of the
regiment, when he introduced flogging for every trivial
offenceâin fact, the triangles were generally the
accompaniment of every evening parade. In addition
to this, he invented more disgraceful and torturing
modes of inflicting the punishment; but all this was
not enough,âhe ordered that defaulters should have
a patch of yellow and black cloth sewed on the sleeve
of the regimental jacket, and a hole cut in it for every
time they were flogged. The effects of this soon
became visible: as good men were liable to be punished
for the slightest fault, the barrier between them and
hardened ill-doers was broken down, and as they had
lost respect in their own eyes, they either became
broken-hearted and inefficient soldiers, or grew reckless
of every thing, and launched into crime; those who
were hardened and unprincipled before, being brought
by the prevalence of punishment nearer a level with
better men, seemed to glory in misconduct. In fact,
all ideas of honour and character were lost, and listless
apathy and bad conduct were the prevailing features of
the corps at this time.

That flogging is notoriously useless in reclaiming
men where they are bad, must be evident to every one
who knows anything of the service, and surely it is
not politic to disgrace an individual, and break his
heart for a casual error. There ought always to be an
opening left for a man to retrieve a false step; but
once bare his back at the halberts, and you shut it for
ever.

[Pg 132]

In the regiment I belonged to, I had a good opportunity
of marking its effects, and in every instance, I
have observed that it changed the individualâs character
for the worse; he either became broken-hearted and
useless to the corps, or shameless and hardened. In
two individual cases, its inefficiency to prevent the
recurrence of the fault was particularly marked,âthe
first was desertion, and the second drunkenness.
These men had received at various times upwards of
two thousand lashes, but the first continued to absent
himself, and the other to get drunk, periodically,
although they were perfectly sure that flogging would
be the result. There were men in the service to whom
the excitement produced by ardent spirits seemed as
necessary as food; in them this unnatural craving for
liquor appeared to me to be a disease, calling for
medical treatment more than punishment.

I have no doubt that many commanding officers resorted
to corporal punishment from the conviction that
it could not be done without; they had tried to dispense
with it and could notâbut I doubt much whether
the experiment was fairly made. They found difficulties
at the outset, and that it was more easy to exert
their authority than their patience; the consequence
was, that flogging was again resorted to, and they
satisfied their conscience, by saying that it could not
be dispensed with. The real method of accomplishing
the desired end was neglected, namely, making themselves
acquainted with the character and disposition of
the men under their command: this, I believe, many
would think incompatible with their dignity; but has
not a commanding officer as good a right to make
himself acquainted with the dispositions of his men,
as the medical officer with their constitutions? If
they did so, they would soon find other means than
flogging, to make those under their command what
they would wish them to be. I am aware that its
frequency at one time had the effect of blinding the
judgment of officers who possessed both feeling and discrimination;
and I have occasionally witnessed a ludicrous
[Pg 133]

waste of sympathy on some inferior animal, where
nothing of the kind was felt for their fellow-creature
suffering under the lash. For instance, I have known
an officer shed tears when his favourite horse broke its
leg, and next day exult in seeing a poor wretch severely
flogged for being late of delivering an order; but I am
happy to say, that the severe discipline of the old school
is fast falling into disrepute, and I hope the time is
not far distant when it will altogether be abolished.

The lieutenant-colonel joined when Captain Lââ
had been some time exercising his power in this despotic
manner, and being a man of a different stamp, he
was not well pleased to find the men of his regiment,
whom he had always been proud of, treated in this
manner. His first order was to cut off all the badges
which Captain Lââ had ordered on the men. The
frequent punishment was next done away, and the
regiment was again placed on a fair footing; but the
effect of their previous ill usage did not so soon disappear.

This village was situated at the foot of a high hill,
which was covered with wood, and from which the
wolves were in the habit of coming down at night, and
prowling about the village in quest of prey. On one
post beside the field where the cattle were killed, the
sentries were very much annoyed by them; but I believe
they did no farther injury than devouring some
pigs and an ass, which had been left out all night.
Towards the end of December we were once or twice
marched from our village, to within a short distance of
Roderigo, for the purpose of intercepting supplies which
the French attempted to throw into it, and the weather
being extremely cold, we suffered much on the journey.
The governor of that garrison (General Renaud) while
out on a reconnoitering party about this time, was taken
prisoner by the Spanish Guerilla chief, Don Julian.

In the beginning of January, 1812, we were removed
for the purpose of besieging Ciudade Roderigo, and we
left this miserable village in the midst of a snow storm,
and marched to Morti Agua. Next day we forded the
[Pg 134]

Agueda, and took up our quarters in Ceridillo del
Arroyo. The siege now commenced; the light division
having succeeded, on the night of the 8th January, in
storming one of the principal outworks (the redoubt of
St Francisco), we opened the trenches the same night,
within 600 yards of the town, the outwork which they
had carried forming part of the first parallel. The
weather was so severe, and the cold so intense, that
the army could not encamp, but the divisions employed
at the siege marched from their different quarters and
relieved each other alternately, every four-and-twenty
hours. Our division took its turn of the duty on the
11th, and the frost was so excessive that we were almost
completely benumbed, and nothing but hard working,
I believe, kept us from perishing with the cold;
indeed, it was said that some Portuguese soldiers actually
died from its effects. Still, however, the work went
on rapidly, and on the night of the 13th, another outwork
(the fortified convent of Santa Cruz) was stormed
by the 1st division, under General Graham. On the
14th the batteries in the first parallel were formed, and
commenced firing from twenty-two pieces of cannon;
that same night the fourth division carried all the remaining
outworks, and we were established in the
second parallel, 150 yards from the town, on the 15th,
on which day it fell our turn, a second time, for the
duty.

The French kept up a very destructive fire on us
during the whole of our operations, and while forming
the second parallel they threw out some fire balls to
enable them to see where we were working, that they
might send their shot in that direction; one of them
fell very near where a party were working, and by its
light completely exposed them to the view of the enemy.
A sergeant belonging to our regiment, of the name of
Fraser, seeing the danger to which they were exposed,
seized a spade, and jumping out of the trench, regardless
of the enemyâs fire, ran forward to where it was
burning, and having dug a hole, tumbled it in and
covered it with earth.

[Pg 135]

On the morning of the 18th, a battery of seven guns
was opened in the second parallel, while those in the
first still continued their fire upon the walls. On the
19th our division again took their turn of the duty;
but as the breaches were now considered practicable,
the other troops destined for the attack were also assembled,
it being Lord Wellingtonâs intention to storm
it that night.

The attack was directed to be made in five different
columns: the two right composed of part of our division,
under the command of Major Ridge of the 5th
regiment, and Colonel OâToole of the 2d CaÃ§adores,
were to protect the attack of the third column (composed
of our right brigade, commanded by General
MâKinnon), upon the principal breach; the left of this
assault was to be covered by part of the light division,
who were, at the same time, to ascend the breaches on
the left; while General Packâs brigade made a false
attack on the south of the fort. On the right of the
whole, the regiment I belonged to were to descend into
the ditch, for the purpose of protecting the descent of
General MâKinnonâs brigade against any obstacles
which might be thrown in the way by the enemy.

Thus arranged, some time after it was dark, we
moved down from our encampment towards the town,
and our regiment having formed behind the walls of an
old convent, each section being provided with a pickaxe
and rope, we advanced rank entire under a heavy
fire from the garrison, to the brink of the trench, where,
planting the one end of the pickaxe firmly in the
ground, we threw the noose of the rope over the other,
and then descended by it into the ditch. After descending,
we moved along towards the breach. Our
orders were to remain there, and protect the right
brigade; but our colonel finding no obstacles in the
way, pushed up the breach, leading on his regiment to
the attack; the fifth regiment, which also belonged to
the covering party, joined us as we ascended, and together
we succeeded in establishing ourselves on the
ramparts, in spite of the obstinate resistance made by
[Pg 136]

the French. The other troops advancing at the same
time, we were masters of the town in half an hour from
the commencement of the attack; but the gallant
General MâKinnon was killed by the springing of a
mine, just as we gained the ramparts. The last time
he was seen alive was when addressing a young officer
who had displayed much courage,ââCome,â said he,
âyou are a fine lad, you and I will go together.â The
next moment the mine sprung. In the morning his
body was got a short distance from the place, wounded
and blackened by the explosion. He was much regretted,
for he was an intelligent, brave, and enterprising
officer. General Crawford, a brave and much
beloved officer, who commanded the light division, was
also mortally wounded in the assault.

The French had behaved well during the siege, and
made a tolerable resistance at the breaches the night of
the storm; but they appeared either to be panic struck,
not expecting us to storm the town so soon, or the
individual who commanded wanted ability, for the dispositions
made for the defence were a mere nothing, in
comparison to those at Badajos, when that town was
taken some time after. In mounting the breach, we
found great difficulty in ascending, from the loose earth
slipping from under our feet at every step, and throwing
us down; the enemy at the same time pouring
their shot amongst us from above. After having gained
possession of the ramparts, the enemy retreated into a
square in the centre of the town, where they were pursued,
and gave up their arms.

Among the prisoners taken, were eighteen deserters
from our army, who were subsequently tried and shot.
The town was partially plundered by those who had
straggled from their regiments, but the different columns
remained formed on the ramparts until daylight, when
a party from each regiment were sent to bury the dead,
and collect the wounded, and I was one of the number.
The first we found was Captain W., a brave and good
officer. He fell mortally wounded near the head of the
breach, while cheering on his men to the assault.

[Pg 137]

Among the wounded lay Lieutenant T., whom we
used to call Robinson Crusoe, from his wearing very
large whiskers, and always carrying a goat skin haversack,
in which he kept the greater part of his necessaries,
including his pipe and tobacco, of which he was
very fond. The other officers rather shunned his company,
from his not being very exact in his dress, and
eccentric in his habits; but he was well liked by the
soldiers, being an excellent officer, and brave as a lion.

In this respect he was worth a hundred dandies. A
few moments before he received the wound, he dragged
a minikin officer from a hiding-place, and brandishing
his sword over him, threatened to cut him down if he
did not advance. But the poor fellow did not go many
paces farther himself, when he was brought down by a
grape shot; yet still he continued to cheer on, and
encourage the men who were ascending.

On the ascent of the breach, lay many dead, and
among the rest my ill-fated friend Sandy, whom I
have had already occasion to mention, as parting from
his wife at Jersey. When I saw him stretched lifeless
on the breach, that scene flashed full upon my memory,
and I could not but remark how true his wifeâs forebodings
had turned out.

By taking the town, we became masters of one
hundred and fifty-three piece of cannon, including the
heavy train of the French army, and a great number
of stores. The Governor (General Banier,) seventy-eight
officers, and one thousand seven hundred men,
were taken prisoners.

Our division was marched out of the town in the
morning, and returned to the village where we were
quartered. On the way home we lost one of our men,
and we never heard of him after. It was suspected
that he either perished among the snow, which lay
thick on the ground, or that he was murdered by some
of the peasantry.

[Pg 138]

CHAPTER IV.

After remaining a few days in Ceridillo del Arroyo,
we removed to Villa Mayor, where we remained until
we received orders to march back our old route to
Badajos, which we invested on the 17th of March.
Our division again taking the left of the Guidiana,
along with the 4th and light, while the right was
occupied by a brigade of General Hamiltonâs division,
we broke ground rather to the left of our old trenches,
within about two hundred yards of Fort Picurini, a
strong outwork.

On the 19th the enemy made a sortie from one of
the gates, a little to the right of our trenches, with two
thousand men; but they were almost immediately
driven in, without effecting anything, having suffered
severely.

On the 25th we opened six batteries with twenty-eight
piece of cannon; and having kept up a heavy
fire on Fort Picurini during the day, for the purpose
of destroying the defences, when it was dark, a detachment
of five hundred men of our division, under
the command of Major General Kempt, were ordered
to storm it. They were formed in three parties, who
attacked at different places at the same time; and they
succeeded, after an obstinate resistance, in gaining
possession of it. Two hundred men garrisoned the
place, out of which one hundred and sixty were killed,
or drowned in the overflow of the river. The colonel
commanding, three other officers, and eighty-six men,
were taken prisoners. Seven cannon were found in
the place, besides some stores. During the assault,
the enemy made a sortie from the town, with a view
either to recover the place, or cover the retreat of the
soldiers who manned it; but they were driven in by
a party of the detachment stationed to protect the
attack.

In this affair we lost a great number of officers and
men, some of them after the place was taken, the
[Pg 139]

enemy having bombarded the fort from the town,
when they found we were in possession of it.

The second parallel was now opened within three
hundred yards of the town, in which two batteries
commenced firing on the 28th. During this time the
weather was so bad, and the rains so heavy, that we
were working in the trenches up to the knees in mud,
and the river swelled to such a height, that the pontoon
bridge, over which we crossed the Guidiana, was
carried away. On the 29th another sortie was made
by the enemy on the right; but they were repulsed by
General Hamiltonâs division. On the 31st twenty-seven
piece of cannon were opened in the second
parallel, on the walls of the town; and the firing was
continued with great effect until the 4th, when another
battery of six guns was opened. Practicable breaches
were effected on the 5th, and we were turned out that
night to storm the town; but the enemy having made
formidable preparations for the defence, the attack was
deferred until next night, during which time all the
guns in the second parallel were brought to bear upon
the breaches. This delay was productive of very
serious feeling throughout the succeeding day, as we
were warned at the time to be ready to storm the town
the next night.

Various were the effects produced on different individuals.
There was an unusual talking of relations, a
recalling to mind of scenes forgotten; a flow of kindly
feeling which softened down the rough soldier into
something milder and more pleasing. Many letters
were written during that day to absent friends, in a
more affectionate style than usual; and many injunctions
given and taken, about writing, in the event of
the fall of either party, to their relations.

The nearer the time drew for the intended attack,
the more each individual seemed to shrink within himself;
yet still nothing of fear or doubt of our success
was expressedâevery feeling displayed was natural and
manly. At length night came, and the appointed hour
for turning out.

[Pg 140]

It was dark and gloomy; not a single star showed
its head; the air was still, not a sound could be heard
but the noise of the field cricket, and the croaking of
frogs; every word of command was given in a whisper,
and the strictest silence enjoined, which I believe was
unnecessary; few felt inclined to speak. At last the
order was given to advance, and with palpitating hearts
we commenced our marchâslow and silent, a dead-weight
hanging on every mind. Had we been brought
hurriedly into action, it would have been different; but
it is inconsistent with the nature of man not to feel as
I have described, in such a situation. The previous
warningâthe dark and silent nightâthe known
strength of the placeâthe imminent danger of the attackâall
conspired to produce it. Yet this feeling was
not the result of want of courage; for I never witnessed
anything like the calm intrepidity displayed in the advance,
after we came within range of the enemyâs cannon.
Being apprized of our intentions, they threw out fireballs
in every direction, and from total darkness they
changed the approaches to the garrison into a state
light as day. By this means they were enabled to see
the direction of our columns, and they opened a fire of
round and grape shot which raked through them, killing
and wounding whole sections. A circumstance
occurred at this time, which may be worthy of notice:âA
man who had been very remarkable for his testy
disposition, and inveterate habit of swearing on all occasions,
happened to hit his foot against a stone, and
stumbled; this vexed him, and uttering an oath, he
wished a shot would come and knock his brains out;
he had scarcely finished these words, when a grape shot
struck him on the forehead, and literally fulfilled the
rash wish. We still advanced, silent as before, save
the groaning of our wounded comrades, until we reached
a sort of moat about fifty feet wide, formed by the inundation
of the river; here we had to pass, rank entire,
the passage being only capable of admitting one at a
time. On this place the enemy had brought their guns
to bear, and they kept up such a fire of grape and
[Pg 141]

musketry on it, that it was a miracle any of us escaped.
When we reached the other side we formed again, and
advanced up the glacis, forcing our way through the
palisades, and got down into the ditch. The ladders by
which we had to escalade the castle were not yet
brought up, and the men were huddled on one another
in such a manner that we could not move; we were
now ordered to fix our bayonets. When we first entered
the trench, we considered ourselves comparatively
safe, thinking we were out of range of their shot, but
we were soon convinced of our mistake, for they opened
several guns from angles which commanded the trench,
and poured in grape shot upon us from each side, every
shot of which took effect, and every volley of which
was succeeded by the dying groans of those who fell.
Our situation at this time was truly appalling. The
attack had commenced at the breaches towards our left,
and the cannon and musketry which played upon our
troops from every quarter of the town attacked, kept
up a continual roll of thunder, and their incessant flash
one quivering sheet of lightning; to add to the awfulness
of the scene, a mine was sprung at the breach,
which carried up, in its dreadful blaze, the mangled
limbs and bodies of many of our comrades.

When the ladders were placed, each eager to mount,
crowded them in such a way that many of them broke,
and the poor fellows who had nearly reached the top,
were precipitated a height of thirty or forty feet, and
impaled on the bayonets of their comrades below; other
ladders were pushed aside by the enemy on the walls,
and fell with a crash on those in the ditch; while more
who got to the top without accident were shot on
reaching the parapet, and tumbling headlong, brought
down those beneath them. This continued for some
time, until at length a few having made a landing good
on the ramparts, at the expense of their lives, enabled
a greater number to follow. When about a company
had thus got collected together, we formed and charged
round the ramparts, bayoneting the French artillery at
their guns. In the direction that the party I was with
[Pg 142]

took, they had drawn out a howitzer loaded to the very
muzzle, pointed it towards us, and a gunner had the
match ready to fire, when he was brought down by one
of our party; in this direction we charged until we
reached the sally-port communicating with the town.
In a short time the whole division were established in
possession of the castle, but the contest at the breaches
was still severe.

The light and 4th divisions had advanced from the
trenches a short time after us, until they reached the
covered way; their advanced guards descended without
difficulty into the ditch, and advanced to the assault
with the most determined bravery, but such was the
nature of the obstacles prepared by the enemy at the
head of the breach, and behind it, that they could not
establish themselves within the place. Repeated
attempts were made until after twelve at night, when
Lord Wellington finding that success was not to be
obtained, and that our division had succeeded in taking
the castle, they were ordered back to the ground where
they had assembled, leaving the breach covered with
dead and wounded. When the governor (Philipon)
found the castle was taken, he retreated into fort St
Christoval, and at daylight in the morning he surrendered
with all the garrison; it had consisted of five
thousand men, of which number twelve hundred were
killed during the siege.

When the town surrendered, and the prisoners were
secured, the gate leading into the town from the castle
was opened, and we were allowed to enter the town for
the purpose of plundering it. We were scarcely through
the gate when every regiment of the division were
promiscuously mixed, and a scene of confusion took place
which baffles description: each ran in the direction
that pleased himself, bursting up the doors and
rummaging through the houses, wantonly breaking up
the most valuable articles of furniture found in them.
Small bands formed, and when they came to a door
which offered resistance, half-a-dozen muskets were
levelled at the lock, and it flew up; by this means
[Pg 143]

many men were wounded, for having entered at another
door, there was often a number in the house, when
the door was thus blown open. The greater number
first sought the spirit stores, where having drank an
inordinate quantity, they were prepared for every sort
of mischief. At one large vault in the centre of the
town, to which a flight of steps led, they had staved
in the head of the casks, and were running with their
hat-caps full of it, and so much was spilt here, that
some, it was said, were actually drowned in it.
Farther on, a number of those who had visited the
spirit store were firing away their ammunition, striving
to hit some bells in front of a convent.

The effects of the liquor now began to show itself,
and some of the scenes which ensued are too dreadful
and disgusting to relate; where two or three thousand
armed men, many of them mad drunk, others depraved
and unprincipled, were freed from all restraint, running
up and down the town, the atrocities which took place
may be readily imagined; but in justice to the army, I
must say they were not general, and in most cases perpetrated
by cold-blooded villains, who were backward
enough in the attack. Many risked their lives in defending
helpless females, and although it was rather a
dangerous place for an officer to appear, I saw many of
them running as much risk to prevent inhumanity, as
they did the preceding night in storming the town. I
very soon sickened of the noise, folly, and wickedness
around me, and made out of the town towards the
breach. When I arrived at where the attack had been
made by the light and 4th divisions, what a contrast to
the scene I had just left! Here all was comparatively
silent, unless here and there a groan from the poor
fellows who lay wounded, and who were unable to
move. As I looked round, several voices assailed my
ear begging for a drink of water: I went, and having
filled a large pitcher which I found, relieved their wants
as far as I could.

When I observed the defences that had been here
made, I could not wonder at our troops not succeeding
[Pg 144]

in the assault. The ascent of the breach near the top
was covered with thick planks of wood firmly connected
together, staked down, and stuck full of sword and
bayonet blades, which were firmly fastened into the
wood with the points up; round the breach a deep
trench was cut in the ramparts, which was planted full
of muskets with the bayonets fixed, standing up perpendicularly,
and firmly fixed in the earth up to the
locks. Exclusive of this they had shell and hand
grenades ready loaded piled on the ramparts, which
they lighted and threw down among the assailants.
Round this place death appeared in every form, the
whole ascent was completely covered with the killed,
and for many yards around the approach to the walls,
every variety of expression in their countenance, from
calm placidity to the greatest agony. Anxious to see
the place where we had so severe a struggle the preceding
night, I bent my steps to the ditch where we
had placed the ladders to escalade the castle. The
sight here was enough to harrow up the soul, and which
no description of mine could convey an idea of. Beneath
one of the ladders, among others lay a corporal
of the 45th regiment, who, when wounded, had fallen
forward on his knees and hands, and the foot of the
ladder had been, in the confusion, placed on his back.
Whether the wound would have been mortal, I do not
know, but the weight of the men ascending the ladder
had facilitated his death, for the blood was forced out
of his ears, mouth, and nose.

Returning to the camp, I passed the narrow path
across the moat, where many lay dead with their bodies
half in the water. When I reached the opposite side,
I perceived a woman with a child at her breast, and
leading another by the hand, hurrying about with a
distracted air, from one dead body to another, eagerly
examining each. She came to one whose appearance
seemed to strike her (he was a grenadier of the 83d
regiment), she hesitated some moments, as if afraid to
realise the suspicion which crossed her mind. At
length, seemingly determined to ascertain the extent of
[Pg 145]

her misery, releasing the child from her hand, she
raised the dead soldier (who had fallen on his face),
and looking on his pallid features, she gave a wild
scream, and the lifeless body fell from her arms. Sinking
on her knees, she cast her eyes to heaven, while
she strained her infant to her bosom with a convulsive
gasp; the blood had fled her face, nor did a muscle of
it move; she seemed inanimate, and all her faculties
were absorbed in grief.

The elder child looked up in her face for some time
with anxiety; at last he said, âMother, why donât you
speak to me?âwhat ails you?âwhat makes you so
pale?âO speak to me, mother, do speak to me!â A
doubt seemed to cross her mindâwithout noticing the
child, she again raised the mangled corpse, looked
narrowly at his face, and carefully inspected the mark
of his accoutrementsâbut it was too trueâit was her
husband. Neither sigh, nor groan, nor tear escaped
her; but sitting down, she raised the lifeless body, and
placing his head on her knee, gazed on his face with
feelings too deep for utterance. The child now drew
himself close to her side, and looking at the bleeding
corpse which she sustained, in a piteous tone, inquired,
âIs that my father? is he asleep? why doesnât he
speak to you? Iâll waken him for youââand seizing
his hand, he drew it towards him, but suddenly relapsing
his hold, he cried, âO mother! his hand is coldâcold
as ice.â

Her attention had been drawn for some moments
to the child: at length bursting out, she exclaimed,
âPoor orphan! he sleeps, never to wake againânever,
O never, will he speak to you or me!â The child did
not seem to understand her, but he began to cry. She
continued, âO my God! my heart will burst, my
very brain burnsâbut I canât cryâSurely my heart is
hardâI used to cry when he was displeased with meâand
now I canât cry when he is dead! O my
husband! my murdered husband!âAy, murdered,â
said she, wiping the blood that flowed from a wound
in his breast. âO my poor children!â drawing them
[Pg 146]

to her bosom, âwhat will become of you?â Here she
began to talk incoherentlyââWill you not speak to
me, William?âwill you not speak to your dear Ellen?
Last night you told me you were going on guard, and
you would return in the morning, but you did not
comeâI thought you were deceiving me, and I came
to look for you.â

She now ceased to speak, and rocked backwards and
forwards over the bleeding corpse; but her parched
quivering lip, and wild fixed look, showed the agonized
workings of her mind. I stood not an unmoved spectator
of this scene, but I did not interrupt it. I considered
her sorrow too deep and sacred for commonplace
consolation. A woman and two men of the
same regiment who had been in search of her, now
came up and spoke to her, but she took no notice of
them. A party also who were burying the dead
joined them, and they crowded round striving to console
her. I then withdrew, and hastened on to the camp,
my mind filled with melancholy reflections; for many
days after I felt a weight on my mind, and even now I
retain a vivid recollection of that affecting scene. But
she was not a solitary sufferer: many a widow and
orphan was made by the siege and storming of Badajos;
our loss amounting, in killed and wounded, to
about three thousand men.

The camp during that day, and for some days after,
was like a masquerade, the men going about intoxicated,
dressed in the various dresses they had found in
the town; French and Spanish officers, priests, friars,
and nuns, were promiscuously mixed, cutting as many
antics as a mountebank. It was some days before the
army could be brought round to its former state of
discipline. Indeed the giving leave to plunder the
town, was productive of nothing but bad consequences,
and for the interests of humanity, and the army at
large, I hope such license may never recur, should we
be again unfortunately plunged in war.

[Pg 147]

CHAPTER V.

A few days after the town was taken, I took the fever
and ague, with which I was so extremely ill, that when
we marched, which we did immediately after, I was
unable to keep up with my regiment, and was left with
four others, about five leagues from Castello Branco, in
charge of a sergeant, who was to endeavour to bring
us on; but being unable to proceed, he was obliged to
put us into a house in the small village in which we
were left. It was occupied by a poor widow, who had
two children; there was only one apartment in the
house, in which there was a loom; and having crept
under it, I lay there for four days without bed or
covering, with the exception of an old great-coat, my
necessaries, which I was unable to carry, having gone
forward with the regiment. The poor Portuguese
widow had little to give except commiseration, and
seemed to feel much for me in particular, as the others
could move about a little. I have often heard her,
when she thought I was asleep, soliloquizing on the
grief it would give my parents, were they to know my
situation; and in her orisons, which she was in the
habit of repeating aloud, she did not neglect a petition
for the âpovre rapaz Englese.â
[12]
She often brought
me warm milk, and pressed me to take a little of it; I
felt very grateful for her sympathy and kindness, but I
was too sick to taste it. As we were here without any
means of support, the sergeant managed to press five
asses to carry us to Castello Branco, where there was
a general hospital forming; on one of these I was
mounted, and supported by the man who drove it, I
took leave of the tender-hearted widow, while the tears
stood in her eyes. Such disinterested feeling I was at
that time little accustomed to, and it was precious.
We proceeded on our journey, but never did I endure
such torture as I did on that day, and I often begged
of them to allow me to lie down and die.

[Pg 148]

On the second day we reached our destination, and
remained waiting in the street for two hours before the
general doctor would look at us. When he did come,
his countenance foreboded no good. âWhatâs the matter
with you, sir?â said he to me, in a scowling tone of
voice. âYou ought to have been with your regiment;
a parcel of lazy, skulking fellowsâthereâs nothing the
matter with any of you!â

I said nothing, but I looked in his face, with a look
which asked him if he really believed what he said, or
if he did not read a different story in my pale face and
sunken cheek. He seemed to feel the appeal, and softening
his countenance he passed on to another. We
were then placed along with others, in the passage of
a convent, which was converted into an hospital; here
I lay that day on the floor, without mattress or
covering. Night came, and a burning fever raged
through my veins; I called for drink, but there was no
one to give it me. In the course of the night I became
delirious; the last thing I remember was strange fantastic
shapes flitting around me, which now and then
catched me up, and flew with me like lightning through
every obstacleâthen they would hold me over a precipice,
and letting me fall, I would continue sinking,
with a horrid consciousness of my situation, until my
mind was lost in some wild vagary of a different nature.
For some days I was unconscious of what was passing,
and when I recovered my senses, I found myself in
a small apartment with others who had bad fevers,
but I was now provided with a mattress and bed-clothes.

A poor fellow, a musician of the 43d regiment, was
next berth to me, sitting up in his bed in a fit of delirium,
addressing himself to some young females,
whom he supposed to be spinning under the superintendence
of an old woman, in a corner of the ceiling;
he kept a constant conversation with his supposed
neighbours, whom he seemed to think were much in
awe of the old dame, and he frequently rose out of his
bed to throw up his handkerchief as a signal. When
[Pg 149]

he recovered, the impression was so strong, that he
remembered every particular.

There was a great want of proper attendants in the
hospital, and many a time I have heard the sick crying
for drink and assistance during the whole night,
without receiving it. There seemed also to be a
scarcity of medical officers during the Peninsular war.
I have known wounded men often to be three days
after an engagement before it came to their turn to be
dressed, and it may be safely calculated that one-half
of those men were thus lost to the service. Those
medical men we had were not always ornaments of the
profession. They were chiefly, I believe, composed of
apothecariesâ boys, who, having studied a session or
two, were thrust into the army as a huge dissecting
room, where they might mangle with impunity, until
they were drilled into an ordinary knowledge of their
business; and as they began at the wrong end, they
generally did much mischief before that was attained.
The extent of their medical practice in most disorders
was to âblister, bleed, and purge,âââwhat then?
why âblister, bleed, and purge again.â This method
of cure with poor wretches who were anything but
over-fed, and whose greatest complaint often was
fatigue and want of proper sustenance, was quite
Ã -la-Hornbook, and the sufferers were quickly laid to
rest. In the field they did more mischief, being but
partially acquainted with anatomy; there was enough
of what medical men call
bold practice
. In cutting
down upon a ball for the purpose of extracting it, ten
chances to one but they severed an artery they knew
not how to stem; but this gave no concern to these
enterprising fellows, for clapping a piece of lint and a
bandage, or a piece of adhesive plaster on the wound,
they would walk off very composedly to mangle some
other poor wretch, leaving the former to his fate.

Here I may be accused of speaking at random, on a
subject I do not understand; but there is no man who
served in the Peninsular war, but can bear witness to
the truth of what I have stated. I, however, do not
[Pg 150]

pretend to say there were not many exceptions to this
character; and in justice to the whole, it must be admitted,
that the duties of a surgeon on the Peninsula,
were fatiguing and arduous in the extreme. The
medical department of the French army was much
superior to ours at that time in every respect; this can
only be accounted for by the superior opportunity they
had of studying anatomy, which in Britain is now almost
prohibitedâmore the pity! Those who have
witnessed the evils resulting to the army in particular,
from imperfectly educated surgeons, must regret that
government does not afford greater facilities to the
study.

The ague fits having returned when the severe fever
left me, I recovered very slowly; the medicine I received,
which was given very irregularly, having done
me no good. While in this state, General Sir John
Hope, who lately commanded the forces in Scotland,
happened to pay a visit to the hospital, and going
round the sick with the staff-surgeon, he inquired,
âWhat was the prevailing disease?â the reply was,

âFever and ague.â

Sir John, whose kind and humane disposition is well
known, mentioned that he had heard of a cure for that
disease among the old women in Scotland, which was
considered infallible. The staff-surgeon smiled, and
begged to hear what it was. âIt is,â said the good old
general, âsimply a large pill formed of spiderâs web,
to be swallowed when the fit is coming on. I cannot
pledge myself for its efficacy, but I have heard it much
talked of.â The staff-doctor gave a shrug, as much to
say it was all nonsense, looked very wise, as all doctors
endeavour to do, and the conversation dropped. I had
been listening eagerly to the conversation, and no
sooner was the general gone, than I set out in quest of
the specific. I did not need to travel far, and returned
to my room prepared for the next fit; when I felt it
coming on, I swallowed the dose with the greatest confidence
in its virtues, and however strange it may appear,
or hard to be accounted for, I never had a fit of the
[Pg 151]

ague after, but got well rapidly, and was soon fit to
march for the purpose of joining my regiment, which I
overtook at Pollos. They had been quartered for some
weeks in a village on the frontiers, from whence they
advanced, and having passed Salamanca, were now in
this place, which was situated on a rising ground on
the bank of the river Douro, our army occupying the
one side, and the French the other.

In this place we were in the habit of turning out of
the town during the night, and lying under arms in the
field; in the day we occupied the village, still wearing
our accoutrements. Fuel was uncommonly scarce; the
inhabitants in the best of times, having only the prunings
of their vines for that purpose, and we were
obliged to cook our victuals with stubble. While here
there was an understanding, I believe, between both
armies, that each should have the use of the river without
molestation, and our men and the French used to
swim in it promiscuously, mixing together, and at times
bringing brandy and wine with them, for the purpose
of treating each other; but though thus friendly to our
men, the French soldiers studiously avoided coming
near the Portuguese, whom they knew by the dark
colour of their skin. This friendly feeling between our
soldiers and the French was remarkably displayed
during the whole war, whenever we were brought in
position close to each other, or either party were taken
prisoners, and it could only be accounted for by the
respect excited by the bravery of each nation, and a
similar generosity of sentiment, for in this the French
were not deficient. How different were our feelings in
this respect from many of our countrymen at home,
whose ideas of the French character were drawn from
servile newspapers and pamphlets, or even from so low
a source as the caricatures in print shops; but I myself
must confess, in common with many others, that I was
astonished when I came in contact with French soldiers,
to find them, instead of pigmy, spider-shanked wretches,
who fed on nothing but frogs and beef tea, stout,
handsome-looking fellows, who understood the principles
[Pg 152]

of good living, as well as any Englishman
amongst us; and whatever may be said to the contrary,
remarkably brave soldiers.

During the time we lay in this position, a German
belonging to our band deserted to the enemy, taking
with him a horse and two mules; he had taken them
down to the river to drink, and led them through to
the opposite side, in the face of both armies; when he
reached the opposite bank, the French lifted him on
their shoulders, and leading the cattle behind him,
carried him up to their camp in triumph, cheering all
the way.

From this place, in consequence of orders to that
effect, we retired upon Salamanca, followed by the
enemy, and took up our position about a mile and a half
from that town, on the right bank of the river Tormes,
where we lay until the 22d July. On the evening of
the 21st it came on a dreadful storm of thunder and
lightning, which so terrified the horses and mules, who
were fastened to stakes in the camp, that they broke
loose and ran about in every direction, causing great
confusion.

On the morning of the 22d, having re-crossed the
Tormes, we took up our position in front of Salamanca,
behind the village of Aldea Teja. The enemy, who
had manÅuvred during the forenoon, about two oâclock
began to extend their left, and moved forward on our
position, which was now taken up,âthe seventh division
on the right, the fourth and fifth in the centre,
while the first and light divisions on our left were
opposed to the enemyâs right, and were, with the fifth
division, in reserve. The attack commenced by our
division, in four columns, moving forward, supported
by a body of cavalry, to turn the enemyâs left: we were
led on by General Packenham, (General Picton having
gone to the rear sick a few days before,) and completely
succeeded; for having formed across the enemyâs flank,
we advanced under a heavy fire from their artillery,
overthrowing every thing before us. The fifth regiment,
in attacking a body of infantry posted on a small
[Pg 153]

height, were furiously charged by the enemyâs cavalry,
and thrown into some confusion: but ours coming up
in time, not only routed them, but cut off the retreat of
their infantry, who were taken prisoners, many of them
dreadfully wounded by our dragoons, some having
their arms hanging by a shred of flesh and skin, and
others with hideous gashes in their faces. In this
manner driving in their left, we came in front of where
our artillery were playing on the enemy; but no time
was lost, for by marching past in open column, they
continued to fire without interruption, sending their
shot through the intervals between each company, without
doing us any injury, although it created rather unpleasant
sensations to hear it whistling past us. The
enemyâs shot and shell were now making dreadful
havoc. A Portuguese cadet who was attached to our
regiment, received a shell in the centre of his body,
which, bursting at the same instant, literally blew him
to pieces. Another poor fellow receiving a grape shot
across his belly, his bowels protruded, and he was
obliged to apply both his hands to the wound to keep
them in; I shall never forget the expression of agony
depicted in his countenance. These were remarkable
cases, but the men were now falling thick on every side.
During the time we were thus successfully engaged, the
fourth and fifth divisions advanced on the enemyâs
centre, supported by Sir Stapleton Cottonâs cavalry,
and drove them from one position after another with
great slaughter; but they were in some measure retarded
in their progress by a fresh body of troops being
pushed forward on their left, from a height which the
enemy had continued to hold in spite of the efforts of a
brigade of our troops under General Pack. This accession
of force was so powerful, that the fourth division
was now brought up, and success was restored; but
the enemyâs right, which was reinforced by those who
had fled from the left, and who had occupied the
heights above-mentioned, still made a stand; the first
and light divisions now had their turn of the battle, and
attacking them with determined vigour, in a short time
[Pg 154]

succeeded in turning their right. The flanks being now
turned, the centre was attacked by the sixth division,
supported by ours and the fourth; but the enemy made
a brave and most determined resistance, and it was
dark before the point was carried.

The French then broke up in great confusion, and
fled through the woods towards the fords of the Tormes,
pursued by the cavalry and first and light divisions, as
long as any of them could be found together. Next
morning the pursuit was renewed at daybreak by the
same troops, who, having crossed the Tormes, came up
with the enemyâs rear-guard of cavalry and infantry;
they were immediately attacked by our dragoons, and
the French cavalry fled, leaving the infantry unprotected,
who were charged by the heavy cavalry of our
German legion, and the whole body, consisting of three
battalions, were taken prisoners.

During the battle, the Spanish army, under Don
Carlos dâEspagne, had remained at a respectable distance
on a height in our rear without having been
engaged; they seemed to be perfectly contented with
seeing us fighting for their country, without having a
hand in it themselves; and when we were successful,
they threw up their caps in the air, and cheered as
heartily as if they had earned the victory; they had
only one or two men wounded of their whole army,
while ours lost nearly the half of its number in killed
and wounded.

In this engagement twenty piece of cannon were
taken, several ammunition waggons, two eagles, and
six colours; one general, three colonels, three lieutenant-colonels,
one hundred and thirty officers of
inferior rank, and between six and seven thousand
prisoners. Four generals were killed and General
Marmont severely wounded.

The French continuing their retreat, our army,
passing Alba de Tormes and Penaranda, continued
their advance towards Madrid, some leagues from
which, there was a severe skirmish between the
French cavalry and some of our German dragoons.
[Pg 155]

The Portuguese cavalry had been first engaged, but
behaving ill, the Germans were obliged to take their
place, and soon retrieved the day. When we passed
the village where the skirmish had taken place, those
who had fallen were lying on the road side, and our
attention was drawn particularly to one of the French
cavalry, who had received such a dreadful blow, that
his head was completely cleft through his brass helmet.
Passing on, we encamped about half a league from
Madrid on the 11th of August, and in a short time our
camp was filled with the inhabitants who had come out
to see us, and in their own language, welcomed us as
their deliverers. On the 12th, being ordered to march
into the town, we were met by the inhabitants carrying
branches of laurel, and playing on guitars and tambourines;
joy beamed on every countenance, the ladies
thronged round the British colours eager to touch them,
and the air was rent with acclamationsââViva los
Engleses,â echoed from every mouth. The windows
were hung with embroidered cloth, and filled with
ladies waving their handkerchiefs.

This was a proud day for the British army. Having
marched up to the Placa del Sol, we took up our
quarters in a large building; but our work was not
yet finished. The French having fortified the Retiro,
had left a garrison in it, whose outposts were established
in the Prado and botanic garden; but that night a
detachment having driven them in, broke through the
wall in several places, and established themselves in
the palace of Retiro, close to the exterior of the enemyâs
works, enclosing the building called La China. Next
morning, the 13th, we were turned out and assembled
on the Prado, with scaling ladders ready to attack the
works, when they capitulated, and were allowed to
march out with the honours of war, the officers their
baggage, and soldiers their knapsacks, and surrendered
themselves prisoners.

There was found in the garrison one hundred and
eighty-nine piece of brass cannon, nine hundred barrels
of gunpowder, twenty thousand stand of arms, and
[Pg 156]

considerable magazines of clothing, provisions, and
ammunition, with the eagles of the thirteenth and fifty-first
regiments. Having relieved their guards, they
marched out at four oâclock in the afternoon, two
thousand five hundred and six men, among whom
were two colonels, four lieutenant-colonels, twenty-two
captains, and thirty-five subalterns.

We were now peaceably quartered in the town,
having time to look about us and recover from our
former fatigues. No place could have been better
adapted for this than Madrid; the air was pure and
healthy; wine, fruit, and provision, good and cheap.
Here we had food for observation in the buildings,
institutions, and manners of the inhabitants, and we
ranged about in the environs, and from one street to
another, as if we had been in a new world. Madrid
has been so often described by writers of ability, that
it would be presumption in me to attempt it, even did
the limits of this work allow; but the delightful walks
of the Prado, the gardens breathing perfumeâthe
beautiful fountainsâthe extensive and picturesque view
from the Segovia gateâthe cool and delicious shades
on the banks of the Manzanaresâtheir womenâtheir
music and nightly serenades, gave it to my mind the
charm of romance.

During the time we remained in Madrid, our troops
were allowed free access to the museum, in the street
Alcala, nearly opposite our barracks. In it there was
a very valuable collection of natural history, particularly
a lump of native gold brought from South America,
which weighed many pounds, some enormous boa
constrictors, and the entire skeleton of a mammoth.
This, like the British Museum, was free to all visitors
three or four days a-week.

Several times during our stay in Madrid we were
admitted, gratis, to see the bull fights, the great
national amusement of the Spaniards. The place of
these exhibitions was a vast amphitheatre, with three
tiers of boxes ranged along the wall, the roof of the
building projecting so far over as to cover them only,
[Pg 157]

all the rest being open. In the highest range of these
on the shade side, was the kingâs box, gorgeously
decorated, those on its right and left being occupied by
the principal nobility. About a dozen seats sloping
from the lowest tier of boxes formed the pit, where the
common people were admitted, and which varied in the
price of admission, according to the degree of shade
afforded. In front of the pit was a passage of a few feet
wide, separated from the arena by a barricade between
five and six feet high. The arena or space where the
bulls were fought was of great dimensions; two main
passages opened into it through the barricade, one by
which the bulls were drawn off when killed, and the
other by which they entered, communicating with a
place where they were kept previous to the fight, that
resembled, in some degree, a large cage, having spaces
between the planks that covered it, where they goaded
and otherwise tormented the animals, to render them
more savage before they entered the arena. But besides
these entrances there were smaller doors opening into
the passage, by which the bull could be driven back
into the area, in the event of his leaping the barricade,
this being no unfrequent occurrence.

I only witnessed the sight once. Lord Wellington
was present, and sat in a box on the right of the kingâs,
the royal box being empty. The performance commenced
by a guard of soldiers marching into the centre of
the arena, forming a circle, and on a signal by beat of
drum, facing outwards, and marching up to the
barricade, where, placing a foot on a step, on the next
signal, they vaulted over into the passage, where they
stood during the exhibition. The horseman who was
to attack the bull, now entered, dressed somewhat in
the same manner as our equestrians or rope dancers,
armed with a spear, rolled round with cord to within
half an inch of the point, to prevent the wound which
he might give the animal from proving mortal. With
him also entered the men on foot, whose office was to
irritate or divert the attention of the bull from the
horseman when in too great danger. They were dressed
[Pg 158]

in nearly the same style, only carrying different coloured
mantles or cloaks.

The signal was now given for the performance to
commence. The footmen ranged themselves round the
barricade, while the horseman, placing his spear in the
rest, remained opposite to, and some distance from, the
door by which the bull was to enter. All being thus
prepared, the door was thrown openâthe animal
rushed furiously out, his nostrils dilated, and his eyeballs
gleaming fire. A flight of pigeons which were
let off at his head as he entered the arena, irritated
him, and attracted his attention a little; but perceiving
the horseman, he began to roar and paw the ground,
and rushed forward upon him. The horse being urged
to a gallop, he was met half-way, and struck by the
spear on the shoulder, and fairly thrown on his hind
legs, bellowing fearfully with the pain of the wound.
The horse had now started aside, and when the animal
regained his feet, which he did almost instantaneously,
he was surrounded by the footmen, who, whenever he
made charge at one of them, threw a mantle over his
head, and while he tossed it, and roared to get rid of
it, danced round, planting arrows in his sides and neck
filled with crackers, which, by the time he got free of
the cloak, began to go off, and maddened him to the
utmost degree. His appearance at this time was terrific.
The horseman was now prepared for a second
charge, which being made, the bull was again attacked
by the footmen, who often ran imminent danger, being
pushed so closely that they were obliged to leap the
barricade. This alternate attack was continued several
times, until the people being tired, the matador was
called for, who entered on foot without any defence
but a small sword. The men on foot still continued to
irritate the animal, until it was roused to the utmost
pitch of madness, when the matador placing himself in
its way, in the midst of one of its most furious attacks,
calmly waited its approach. Seeing the bull close upon
him, we expected that the man would be gored to
deathâthat there was no possibility of his escape. But
[Pg 159]

the moment the enraged animal came within his reach,
he darted the sword, quick as lightning, between the
horns into the back of his neck, and he fell dead at his
feet, without giving a single struggle. The music now
began to play, and amidst the deafening plaudits of the
spectators, six mules, gaily caparisoned, entered, and
having their traces fastened to the dead bull, dragged
him from the arena.

Six bulls were thus despatched without much variation
in the mode; but one of them (of Andalusian
breed), remarkable for its strength and fierceness, having
been missed by the horseman in his attempt to strike
him, came on so furiously that he had not time to
escape, and the bull running the poor horse up against
the barricade, lowered his head, and bringing up his
horns, tore up his belly in such a way, that part of his
bowels protruded at the wound, and hung down to the
ground. The horseman, who had with great agility
drawn up his leg, was now supported from falling by
those who were in the passage, his right leg being
jammed in between the horse and the barricade. The
attention of the animal was soon drawn off by the men
on foot; and the man was no sooner released from his
dangerous situation, than, mounting afresh the wounded
animal, he endeavoured to push it forward to another
charge, with its bowels trailing on the ground. This
action, which deserved to be execrated as a piece of
wanton cruelty, was lauded to the skies, and cries of
âBravo! bravo!â resounded from every quarter. But
the poor animal only moved a few steps, when it fell
down dead.

The bull was now enraged so much that nothing
could divert him from his purpose, and having followed
one of the footmen to the limits of the arena, fairly
leaped the barricade after him. A scene of dreadful
confusion ensued, those in the pit and passage flying in
every direction. The danger was soon over, however, for
opening one of the doors already mentioned, he was driven
back into the arena, and despatched by the matador.

The last bull ushered in was baited by dogs. I do
[Pg 160]

not believe that many of our men were much captivated
with this amusement; it was rather considered a cruel
and disgusting one. I cannot understand how it is so
much encouraged in Spain, unless it be to serve the
same purpose that we pay boxers to murder each other,
namely, to keep up the national courage.

I have known some of those âbruisingâ fellows in
the army,âindeed every regiment has its âbully;â but
although they were always forward enough to abuse
and tyrannize over their fellow-soldiers, who were not
of the âfancy,â I never knew one of them that displayed
even ordinary courage in the field; and it was invariably
by fellows of this description that outrages, such
as those perpetrated at Badajos, were committed.

While in Madrid, one of their state prisoners was
executed for treason: I do not remember his rank or
name, but the mode of execution was so singular, that
it may be worth describing.

On the day appointed for his execution, a scaffold
was raised in the Placa Real, or Royal Square. In
the centre of this platform there was fixed an apparatus,
resembling a chair, only, in place of the usual back,
there was an upright stake; to this there was fastened
an iron collar, which, by means of a screw behind,
could be tightened or relaxed at pleasure. A vast concourse
of people had assembled to see the criminal
suffer. He was led to the place of execution on an
ass, having his arms pinioned, a crucifix in his hand,
and surrounded by priests. On mounting the scaffold,
he was placed on the seat already described, bound
firmly down, and the priest took his place in front of
him, with a crucifix in his hand, and from his violent
gesticulations, seemed to be exhorting him very earnestly.
This ceremony finished, the garotte or collar
was placed about his neck, and his face covered. The
executioner stood prepared, and on the signal being
given, as far as I recollect, one wrench did the business,
having completely flattened his neck. In this situation
he remained a considerable time, when the body was
removed, and the crowd dispersed.

[Pg 161]

Poor English Boy

CHAPTER VI.

About the 24th of October, we marched from Madrid
to Pinto, a distance of about three leagues; in consequence
of the enemy advancing in great force in that
direction. Here we remained until the 30th, when we
were ordered to retreat upon Madrid, and passed our
pontoons burning on the road side, having been set on
fire to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy.

We supposed at first that we would again occupy
Madrid, but when we came in sight of it the Retiro
was in flames, and we could hear the report of cannon,
which proceeded from the brass guns in the fort being
turned on each other for the purpose of rendering
them useless to the enemy; the stores of provision and
clothing which we had previously taken were also
burned, and every preparation made for evacuating the
place. The staff-officers were galloping about giving
directions to the different divisions concerning their
route; the inhabitants whom we met on the road were
in evident consternation, and every thing indicated an
unexpected and hurried retreat: instead, therefore, of
entering the city, we passed to the left of it. The
enemyâs cavalry by this time being close on our rear,
and before ours had evacuated the town on the one
side, the French had entered it on the other. We
marched about a league past Madrid, when we encamped
for the night; but next morning we proceeded
on our retreat, nor halted until we reached Salamanca,
having the enemy encamped close on our rear every
night.

The French having taken up nearly the same position
they had occupied on the 22d of July, on the
afternoon of the 15th November we turned out of the
town, and forming on nearly our old ground, expected
an immediate engagement. We had been so much
harassed in retreating from Madrid in the severe
weather, that we felt much more inclination to fight
than to go farther, but we were disappointed; and
[Pg 162]

after performing some evolutions, we filed off on the
road leading to Roderigo, and commenced retreating
as night was setting in. I never saw the troops in
such a bad humour.

Retreating before the enemy at any time was a
grievous business, but in such weather it was doubly
so; the rain, now pouring down in torrents, drenched
us to the skin, and the road, composed of a clay soil,
stuck to our shoes so fast, that they were torn off our
feet. The night was dismally dark, the cold wind
blew in heavy gusts, and the roads became gradually
worse. After marching in this state for several hours,
we halted in a field on the road side, and having piled
our arms, were allowed to dispose ourselves to rest as
we best could. The moon was now up, and wading
through the dense masses of clouds, she sometimes
threw a momentary gleam on the miserable beings who
were huddled together in every variety of posture,
endeavouring to rest or screen themselves from the
cold. Some were lying stretched on the wet ground
rolled in still wetter blankets, more having placed
their knapsack on a stone, or their wooden canteen,
had seated themselves on it with their blankets wrapped
about them, their head reclining on their knees, and
their teeth chattering with cold; while others more
resolute and wise, were walking briskly about. Few
words were spoken, and as if ashamed to complain of
the hardships we suffered, execrating the retreat, and
blaming Lord Wellington for not having sufficient
confidence in us to hazard a battle with the enemy,
under any circumstances, were the only topics discussed.

A considerable time before daylight we were again
ordered to fall in, and proceeded on our retreat. The
rain still continued to fall, and the roads were knee
deep. Many men got fatigued and unable to proceed.
Some spring waggons were kept in the rear to bring
them up, but the number increased so fast that there
was soon no conveyance for them; and as we formed
the rear guard, they soon fell into the hands of the
[Pg 163]

French cavalry, who hung on our rear during the
whole retreat. When we came to our halting ground,
the same accommodation awaited us as on the preceding
evening. By some mismanagement the commissary
stores had been sent on with the rest of the
baggage to Roderigo, and we were without food. The
feeling of hunger was very severe. Some beef that
had remained with the division was served out to us,
but our attempts to kindle fires with wet wood was
quite abortive. Sometimes, indeed, we managed to
raise a smoke, and numbers gathered round, in the
vain hope of getting themselves warmed, but the fire
would extinguish in spite of all their efforts. Our
situation was truly distressing; tormented by hunger,
wet to the skin, and fatigued in the extreme, our reflections
were bitter; the comfortable homes and firesides
which we had left were now recalled to mind, and
contrasted with our present miserable situation; and
during that night many a tear of repentance and
regret fell from eyes, âunused to the melting mood.â

About the same hour as on the preceding morning,
we again fell in and marched off, but the effects of
hunger and fatigue were now more visible. A savage
sort of desperation had taken possession of our minds,
and those who had lived on the most friendly terms in
happier times, now quarrelled with each other, using
the most frightful imprecations on the slightest offence.
All former feeling of friendship was stifled, and a misanthropic
spirit took possession of every bosom. The
streams which fell from the hills were swelled into
rivers, which we had to wade, and vast numbers fell
out, among whom were officers, who, having been
subject to the same privation, were reduced to the
most abject misery.

It was piteous to see some of the men, who had
dragged their limbs after them with determined spirit
until their strength failed, fall down amongst the mud,
unable to proceed farther; and as they were sure of
being taken prisoners, if they escaped being trampled
to death by the enemyâs cavalry, the despairing farewell
[Pg 164]

look that the poor fellows gave us when they saw us
pass on, would have pierced our hearts at any other
time; but our feelings were steeled, and so helpless
had we become, that we had no power to assist, even
had we felt the inclination to do so. Among the rest,
one instance was so distressing, that no one could
behold it unmoved. The wife of a young man, who
had endeavoured to be present with her husband on
every occasion, if possible, having kept up with us
amidst all our sufferings from Salamanca, was at length
so overcome by fatigue and want, that she could go no
farther. For some distance, with the assistance of her
husbandâs arm, she had managed to drag her weary
limbs along, but at length she became so exhausted,
that she stood still unable to move. Her husband was
allowed to fall out with her, for the purpose of getting
her into one of the spring waggons, but when they
came up, they were already loaded in such a manner
that she could not be admitted, and numbers in the
same predicament were left lying on the road side.
The poor fellow was now in a dreadful dilemma, being
necessitated either to leave her to the mercy of the
French soldiers, or by remaining with her to be taken
prisoner, and even then perhaps be unable to protect
her. The alternative either way was heart-rending;
but there was no time to lose,âthe French cavalry
were close upon them. In despairing accents she
begged him not to leave her, and at one time he had
taken the resolution to remain; but the fear of being
considered as a deserter urged him to proceed, and
with feelings easier imagined than described, he left
her to her fate, and never saw her again; but many
a time afterwards did he deprecate his conduct on that
occasion, and the recollection of it embittered his life.

On this night the rain had somewhat abated, but
the cold was excessive, and numbers who had resisted
the effects of the hunger and fatigue with a hardy spirit,
were now obliged to give way to its overpowering
influence, and sunk to the ground praying for death
to relieve them from their misery; and some prayed
[Pg 165]

not in vain, for next morning before daylight, in passing
from our halting ground to the road, we stumbled
over several who had died during the night. Inadvertently
I set my foot on one of them, and stooped down
to ascertain whether the individual was really dead,
and I shall never forget the sickening thrill that went
to my heart, when my hand came in contact with his
cold and clammy face. On this day our hearts seemed
to have wholly failed us: to speak was a burden, and
the most helpless weakness pervaded every individual;
we had now arrived at that pitch of misery which
levels all distinction of rank, and I believe no order
would have been obeyed unless that which was
prompted by regard to the common safety.

Dennis, round whom there used to be gathered a
host of his comrades, listening to his witticisms or quaint
remarks, and whose spirits I had never known to fail,
was now crest-fallen, and moved along with the greatest
difficulty. Nothing but death, however, could altogether
keep down his buoyant spirits; for if we got a
minuteâs halt during the march, he made such ludicrous
remarks on the wo-begone countenances of himself or
his companions, that, although the effort was distressing,
they were obliged to smile in spite of their misery.

This day we halted sooner than usual, and the
weather being clearer, we got fires kindled,âstill no
rations; but we were encamped among oak trees, and
greedily devoured the acorns which grew upon them,
although nauseous in the extreme, the officer commanding
the brigade and our colonel joining in the
repast. In many respects the officers were in a worse
situation than the men, not having anything to change
themselves, as their baggage had been sent on before us.

If anything could have given us comfort in our
miserable situation, it was having a kind and sympathising
commanding officer: he made many of the
weakly men throw away their knapsacks, and by every
means in his power he endeavoured to infuse comfort
and courage into their sinking hearts, braving every
difficulty in common with the meanest individual, and
[Pg 166]

even rejected the superior accommodation which his
rank afforded, while he saw the men suffering. It was
in a situation like this where true greatness of mind
could be displayed; and there must have been something
innately great and noble in the mind which could
thus rise superior even to nature. In my opinion, a
much greater degree of real courage was necessary to
brave the horrors of this retreat, than to face the fire
of a battery.

During the night our situation was worse than in
the day, for there was then nothing to divert our attention
from our wretched state; and although we
despaired of ever seeing it, we felt that indescribable
longing after home, which every one must have felt in
the same situation. It will be needless to detail our
next dayâs sufferingsâthey were of the same nature
as the preceding, only more aggravated.

We were now drawing near Roderigo, where our
baggage had been ordered; each day our hopes had
been kept alive in the expectation that we would find
provision at our halting place, but we were deceived.
Now, however, these expectations were more likely to
be realised. About dusk we took up our ground on
the face of a hill near Roderigo, and the weather
changing to a severe frost, was intensely cold. We
had not been long halted when the well known summons
of âTurn out for biscuit,â rung in our ears.
The whole camp was soon in a bustle, and some of the
strongest having gone for it, they received two daysâ
rations for each man. It was customary to divide it,
but on this night it was dispensed with, and each
eagerly seizing on what he could get, endeavoured to
allay the dreadful gnawing which had tormented us
during four days of unexampled cold and fatigue. In
a short time, two rations more were delivered, and the
inordinate eating that ensued threatened to do more
mischief than the former want. We went into quarters
next day, and many who had borne up during the
retreat now fell sick, and were sent to the hospital.

From this place we removed in a few days some
[Pg 167]

way into Portugal, where we took up our winter
quarters in a small village, called Fonte Arcada.

CHAPTER VII.

Fonte Arcada, in which our regiment was quartered,
(the remainder of the division being distributed in the
surrounding villages,) was situated on the face of a hill,
which formed one of an extensive range; at its foot
ran one of the tributary streams of the Douro,
meandering through a fertile and tolerably well
cultivated valley. The village itself was built on a
bare and rugged mass of rock, and the frowning ledge
that hung over the town gave it a wild and romantic
air. The place had not escaped the ravages of war,
but being more out of the common route, it had
suffered little in comparison to others. The houses had
rather a mean appearance, with the exception of three
or four belonging to fidalgos, who resided in the village;
but the situation was healthy. And after we had
cleaned it, (which we had to do with every Portuguese
village before we could inhabit them,) we felt ourselves
very comfortable, and soon forgot our former fatigue,
which we did the readier, that we had now a commanding
officer who interested himself warmly in our
welfare.

Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd had joined us from the 43d
regiment. I have already had occasion to mention him,
in describing the retreat from Salamanca. No eulogium,
however, of mine can convey an idea of his merits as a
man and soldier; but it is deeply engraven on the hearts
of those who served under him.

So harmoniously did he blend the qualities of a brave,
active, intelligent officer with those of the gentleman
and the scholar, that the combination fascinated all
ranks. His exterior corresponded with his mind; he
was somewhat above the middle sizeâand to a face
and head cast in the true Roman mould, was joined an
elegant and manly body. His system of discipline was
[Pg 168]

not coercive; he endeavoured to encourage, not to
terrifyâif there was a single spark of pride or honour
in the bosom, he would fan it to a flame. His aim was
to prevent crime rather than to punish it, and he rarely
resorted to corporal punishment. When he did so, it
was only in the case of hardened ill-doers, with whom
no lenient measures would succeed; even then, he never
punished to the tenth part of the sentence awarded; and
if the culprit sued for pardon, promising not to be guilty
again, he would say, âI take you at your word, and
forgive you, but remember your promise.â

The menâs interests formed his chief study, and the
complaint of the meanest individual was heard and
investigated with the strictest impartiality, without
respect to persons. By the measures he took, he made
every individual interested in his own honour and that
of the regiment; and I believe that every man in it
loved and honoured him. So successful were his efforts,
that he brought the regiment into a state of order,
cleanliness, and discipline, which could never have
been attained by any other means. He was always
the first in danger and the last out of it; and in camp,
he went later to rest, and was sooner up than the
meanest individual composing his corps.

He was a native of Ireland, (Limerick, I believe,)
and a striking corroboration of the general remark, that
where an Irishman is a gentleman, he is one in the
most extensive meaning of the word; unfettered by
cold, calculating selfishness, his noble heart and soul is
seen in every thing he doesâsuch was Colonel Lloyd.

The inhabitants here were similar to those we had
met with in other villages in Portugal,âsunk in
ignorance, dirt, and superstition; and although some
of the fidalgos boasted that the blood of Braganza
flowed in their veins, they did not seem to be a whit
more refined or better informed than the plebeians.
They were rigid attendants on all the religious ceremonies
of their church, but religion with them appeared
to be a mere habit,âit played on the surface, but did
not reach the heart. When the bell rang at stated
[Pg 169]

periods for prayers, each rosary was put in requisition;
but this did not interrupt the conversationâthey
managed to pray and converse at the same time. As
bigotry is always the attendant of ignorance, they
were no way liberal in their opinions concerning us;
and so contaminated did they consider us by heresy,
that they would not drink out of the same vessel. But,
to tell the truth, I believe they did not understand
the principles of the religion they professed, and the
âPadre Curaâ of the village (a gross and unspiritual
looking piece of furniture) did not seem much qualified
to inform them.

We remained here near six months, during which
vigorous preparations were made for the ensuing
campaign, but little occurred interesting or worth
recording while quartered in the village, with the
exception of a love affair in which my friend Henry
was engaged, which is so tinged with romance that I
could scarcely expect credence to the detail, were it
not that all who were then present with the regiment
can vouch for its truth. Henry, whose warm heart
and romantic imagination often produced him remarkable
adventures, here fell deeply in love. In fact, his
head was so stuffed with the machinery and plots of
novels and romances, that his heart, as Burns expresses
it, âwas like a piece of tinder ready to burst forth into a
flame, from the first casual spark that might fall upon
it.â Fortune, however, had as yet guarded it from any
such accident, and reserved for winter quarters and
quieter times, the shaft which was to destroy his
peace.

He had by dint of application to the principles of
the language, and a talent for acquiring it, gained a
tolerable knowledge of the Portuguese, and at this
time he held a situation which exempted him in a
degree from military duty, and left him time to associate
with some of the inhabitants who were fond of
his conversation, and felt friendly towards him. It
was by this means he became acquainted with a female
whose charms had captivated him. She was niece to
[Pg 170]

one of the principal inhabitants, and about fifteen or
sixteen years of age. In her he imagined he had found
the long cherished ideal mistress of his soul, on whom
he had lavished more accomplishments and perfections
than would have made an angel in our degenerate
days. I was, of course, his confidant, and certainly,
of all I had ever heard or read of loveâs extravagance,
I witnessed it in him. He could neither eat nor sleep;
every spare moment that he had was spent on a small
eminence opposite the house where she lived, gazing at
the windows, in hopes to catch a glance at her; here
he would sit luxuriating in all the wild uncertainty of
hope, anticipation, and despair, which lovers commonly
indulge in, and although his familiarity with the family
might have gained him access to her company any
time he pleased, he grew diffident of visiting them, and
even shrunk from the idea of speaking to herself on the
subject. He poured all his doubts and hopes in my
ear, and he could not have found one to whom they
were more interesting. Of the same romantic temperament,
I shared in all his sensations. Seeing the state
of mind in which he was placed by his violent attachment,
I recommended him strongly that he should
endeavour to gain an interview, and speak to her on
the subject; but he considered this impracticable, as
the sight of her never failed to agitate him in such a
manner, that it robbed him of all power of utterance.
Thus situated, and willing to render my friend a
service, through my interest with a family whom she
was in the habit of visiting, I brought about an interview
between the parties; and here, for the first time,
I saw Maria. She was certainly a very pretty, good-humoured,
lively girl, but in my opinion very far
indeed from the paragon of perfection which Henry
was inclined to think her; but I felt not the magic
influence of that power, which, like the philosopherâs
stone, can transmute the baser metals into gold.
Little satisfaction accrued to Henry from this meeting,
but it subsequently led to others in which the parties
came to a mutual explanation, and he had reason to
[Pg 171]

hope that he was not regarded by her with indifference.
From this time their interviews were more frequent
and less guarded; and visiting her aunt frequently,
although he could not converse freely with Maria, still
their eyes, which âlooked unutterable things,â were
not sufficiently restrained, and the old lady began to
suspect the truth; the tattle of the village confirmed
her suspicions, and she forbade Henry the house.
They had a few stolen meetings at her friendâs in the
village, but this also was discovered, and Maria was
prohibited from leaving the house unattended.

I am almost persuaded that had affairs gone on
smoothly, Henry would have come to his senses, and
the attachment would have died a natural death. But
these obstacles only served to increase his ardour and
perseverance; for so well was Maria now guarded, that
there was no possibility of seeing her. In this dilemma,
he determined on applying to Donna Anna, the girlâs
aunt; from this application he had but little to hope,
yet still he could lose nothing. Having thus resolved,
he went boldly into the house, and without speaking to
any one, lest they might frustrate his purpose, he
traversed the passages, until he perceived Donna Anna
in one of the apartments alone, employed at her
distaff. He entered, his heart fluttering with suspense;
and after apologizing for his rudeness in thus intruding
upon her, he proceeded to declare his love to Maria,
and to beg her acquiescence to their union. The old
lady seemed thunderstruck at his presumption, yet still
Henry had so qualified his address to her, that she had
no good reason to be angry, and after taking a few
minutes to recollect herself, she replied, âthat Maria
was already betrothed to a very deserving young man,
a cousin of her own; but independent of this engagement,
she could not give her consent. What had
Maria to expect if she married a soldier of a foreign
regiment? In the midst of war, the soldiers themselves
suffered much, but those hardships and sufferings
must fall heavier on a delicate female who had
never known anything but comfort. No,â continued
[Pg 172]

she, âMaria has superior expectations. But supposing
I considered you a fit match for her in every other
respect, still your religion would be an insurmountable
barrierâto enter into the bonds of matrimony with a
heretic, she might as well ally herself to the devil! I
have no objection to your character, and feel a friendship
for you, but I can never encourage you in your
present designs, nor give my consent to a marriage,
that would be productive of misery to at least one, if
not to both parties.â

The calm and decided tone in which she spoke, convinced
Henry that he had nothing to hope for from
her, and his heart grew too big for utterance. He
tried to suppress his feelings, but they were too strong
for him, and he was only relieved from their suffocating
effect by a flood of tears. The Donnaâs heart softened
to see his distress, yet she still remained inflexible to
her purpose. Maria, who had seen Henry enter the
house, having followed him to the door of her auntâs
apartment, had overheard the conversation, and now,
seeing her auntâs back turned towards the door, she
watched him until he raised his eyes, when giving him
a sign which infused new hope into his mind, she retired.
Henry now took his leave without enforcing his
suit any farther. I had been waiting his return, and
when he told me the result of his visit, I encouraged
him to hope that all might yet be well.

During the day he received a message by a Portuguese
boy, who was servant with one of our officers, informing
him that she was so closely watched, that there was no
hope of her being able to see him, unless he could
manage to get over the garden wall, which was
exceedingly high; if so, that she would meet him that
night. Having returned an answer that she might
expect him, he called upon me; we reconnoitred the
garden wall, and having noted where there was a ladder,
and procured a rope which was intended for our descent,
after waiting anxiously until within half an hour of the
appointed time, we proceeded to the place where we
intended to effect our escalade. The inhabitants
[Pg 173]

having retired to rest, and the village silent, we got
over without difficulty. We had waited for some time
at the head of one of the side walks (the place appointed)
concealed by the bushes, when we heard the gentle
sound of footsteps. We did not move from our hiding
place until the appointed signal was given, when in an
instant, they were in each otherâs arms.

Where the heart is pure, I am led to believe, that
the zest of love is the higher, the lower the station of
the lovers. No fictitious refinement interferes to check
the cup of joy: so it was in the present instance. Still,
however, our situation was perilous, and I urged the
necessity of forming some plan to bring about the
desired purpose; but their hearts were too much
fluttered with joy and hope, uncertainty and fear, to
make the necessary arrangements, and they parted
hurriedly without doing more than appointing a second
meeting. The appointed time again arrived, and we
reached the garden as easily as before, but Maria did
not come for nearly an hour after the time agreed on,
and we were beginning to think some accident had
befallen her, when we heard her steps coming up the
walk. She seemed much disturbed; âYou would
wonder at my delay,â said she, âbut I am afraid they
suspect me. My aunt did not retire to rest at the
usual hour, and before she did, she came into my
apartment, and held the candle close to my face, but
I pretended to sleep soundly; she then retired, and I
embraced the opportunity of slipping outâbut I cannot
stayâshe may return to my apartment, and if she
does I am undone.â

âBut can we come to no conclusion with regard to
what should be done?â said I. âYou have no reason
to hope that your aunt will ever consent to your
marriage; therefore your only plan is to escape with
Henry, and get married by the chaplain of the division,
before your friends can prevent it; then, when they
find that no better can be done, there is every reason
to believe they will be reconciled to you.â

âO it is impossible!â said she; âI know them too well.â

[Pg 174]

âCertainly,â said I, âthe sacrifice is great, but the alternative
is to bid each other adieu for ever. You must
now decide, or we may never have another opportunity.â

âI cannot make up my mind to-night,â said she:
âI will meet you here to-morrow night at this hour,
determined and ready prepared either to remain, or
make my escape. Now farewell, for I am afraid that
I am discovered.â

So saying, she parted hastily from us, and returned
into the house, leaving poor Henry in no enviable state;
his fate hung upon her decision, she had spoken with
uncertainty, and he looked forward to the next meeting
as the die that would determine his future happiness or
misery.

During next day, Henryâs mind was in such a state
of uneasiness and suspense, that I could, with great
difficulty, bring him to make the necessary arrangements
in the event of her escaping with him. It was
necessary that he should apply to his commanding
officer for permission to marry; and I advised him to
disclose the whole matter to him, well knowing that
such a character as he was would take an interest in
his fate. Henry took my advice, and having called on
Colonel L., disclosed every circumstance connected with
the affair. Colonel L. listened with attention, and
seemed much interested. The story in part was not
new to him; he had heard it from some of the principal
inhabitants. He reasoned the matter with Henry like
a father; represented the difficulty which would lie in
his pathâmarrying a foreigner of a different religionâthe
hardships she would have to endureâand the
many difficulties which two people, marrying so young,
would have to encounter. âBut,â said he, âI suppose
all these things appear as trifles to you at present.â

Henry owned that his affection was too deeply rooted
to be moved by these considerations.

âWell,â said Colonel L., âif you are determined on
trying the experiment, and that she is agreeable, I
have no objection to giving you permission to marry,
but I cannot say you have my approbation.â

[Pg 175]

Henry, however, it may be easily imagined, was
not to be moved by sober reasoning.

The time of meeting arrived, and Henry, trembling
with suspense and apprehension, accompanied me to
the garden. We were not long there, when Maria
arrived with a few articles of wearing apparel, which
she had hurriedly collected.

âWell, Maria,â said I, âhave you decidedâare you
ready to accompany us?â

âI donât know,â said she, âI am so filled with apprehension,
that I cannot think or speak.â

âSay the word,â said I, âall is ready.â

âOh, I donât know,â said she. âEither let me
return into the house, or let us leave this, or I shall
die with fear: I am sure I have been observed. O
Jesu, Maria! there they comeâI am lost.â

So saying, she fled down the opposite path, where
she was immediately seized by some of the domestics,
who had been mustered for the purpose of surprising
us. There was no time to lose, for resistance would
have been useless; and we too well knew the nature
of the Portuguese, to depend much on their mercy.
Hurrying, therefore, towards the wall, and having
assisted Henry, who was rendered nearly powerless by
the effect of his feelings, I made a spring and seized
the top of the wall; Henry was ready to lend me
assistance, but before I could get myself raised to the
summit, a sword aimed for my body, struck the wall
so close to my side, that it cut out a piece of my jacket
and shirt. Ere the blow could be repeated, I had
fallen over on the opposite side, carrying Henry with
me in my fall. I was severely hurtâbut there was
no time to lose, and we knew the alarm would soon
be raised; therefore, having conveyed the ladder to
where we had found it, we hurried to our quarters.

Next day the Portuguese boy brought information
to Henry that early that morning two mules had been
brought into the court yard; that Maria was brought
out weeping, and mounted on one, her aunt on the
other, and that two servants, armed, had accompanied
[Pg 176]

them; he was not allowed to follow them, and therefore
could not tell what direction they had taken,
but Maria had whispered to him, to give Henry her
last farewell, for she never expected to see him again,
as she was ignorant of where they were taking her.
When Henry received this information, distracted with
a thousand contending emotions, among which despair
was predominant, he seized a bayonet, and rushed bare-headed
from his quarters, traversed one road after
another in search of her, making inquiry of every person
whom he met, if they had seen her,âbut she had been
some hours gone. After travelling about from one place
to another in this distracted state, and being taken for
a madman by all who met him, worn out by the violence
of his feelings, he became calm, and returned home in
the dusk of the evening; but it was a calm produced
by one master feeling having swallowed up the rest;
despair had now taken possession of his mindââThe
stricken bosom that can sigh, no mortal arrow bears.â
He walked into his apartment, and having taken up a
musket, and loaded it, he placed the muzzle against his
head, and was in the act of putting his foot on the
trigger, when a soldier happened to enter, and seizing
him, arrested the rash deed.

I had been placed on guard that morning, nor did I
know anything of what had occurred, until Henry was
brought to the guard-house, where he was ordered to
be particularly watched. I went over to speak to him,
but he looked at me with a vacant stare, nor did he
seem conscious of what I said. Sitting down in a
corner, he remained with his eyes fixed on the floor
for some time, then rising, he walked about with a
hurried pace, while his countenance showed the burning
fever of his mind; a fit of tenderness succeeded, and he
raved of all that had happened, which I only could
understand. To me it was a most affecting scene, for
I had no hope that his reason would return, and I
contemplated the wreck of his mind, as one would do
the destruction of all that was dear to him. I watched
him attentively during the night, and towards morning
[Pg 177]

nature became so far exhausted, that he fell into a
confused slumber. When he awoke, the naked reality
of his situation struck him intensely. He perceived me,
and stretching out his hand, he burst into tears. In
broken accents he informed me of the death of all his
hopes; but his mind was unstrungâhe could not think
connectedly.

At this time he was sent for to attend at the colonelâs
lodgings. The noble character of our commanding
officer was particularly shown in the sympathy and
concern which he evinced for the unfortunate Henry;
he entered into all his feelings, and alternately soothed
and reasoned with him, until he had brought him to a
calmer state of mind; then after expressing the kindest
solicitude for his welfare, he dismissed him to his
quarters, telling him at the same time, that he would
use his interest to gain the consent of her relations to
the match, and that nothing should be wanting on his
part to bring the affair to a happy conclusion. This,
in some measure, restored the balm of hope to Henryâs
mind; but, alas! it was only a temporary relief, for
although Colonel L. faithfully kept his promise, and
several of the officers who were on good terms with the
family used their utmost endeavours in his behalf, it
was all to no purpose,âthe more they pressed, the
more obstinate they became.

Things were in this state when he unexpectedly
received a message from Maria, informing him that
she was closely confined in the house of a gentleman
(who was a relative of her aunt,) about nine miles
from the town; from the manner in which she was
guarded, she had no hope of being able to make her
escape, for there were people employed to watch the
avenues to the house, with orders if he approached it
to show him no mercy; that she saw little use in giving
him this information, but she could not resist the
opportunity which had presented itself, of letting him
know where she was. Henry gave way to the most
entrancing anticipations on receiving this information;
but when he communicated it to me, I considered the
[Pg 178]

subject in a different light. I saw that it was more
likely to keep alive the commotion of a passion which
there was little hope of ever arriving at its object; I
knew the attempt to go to the house would be pregnant
with danger, still I felt inclined to assist him in another
determinate effort to carry off the prize.

Henry called on Colonel L. for the purpose of procuring
a pass. When he communicated his intention,
he not only gave him the pass, but also a letter to the
gentleman of the house where Maria was, (with whom
he was well acquainted,) to serve as an introduction.
Thus prepared, Henry and I, in company with the boy
already mentioned, set forward after it was dark
towards the place, taking a by-road. When we
reached the house, we left the boy outside, as he was
known to the family, and entering, presented the
letter from Colonel L. We were kindly received; and
as it was late, the gentleman insisted on us stopping all
nightâso far all was well. We had been about an
hour in the house when Maria happened to come down
stairs: she knew us immediately, but concealed her
emotions, and coming near the fire, she watched an
opportunity until the servants were engaged about the
house, and then whispering to us, asked our motive in
coming there. âIf they know you,â said she, âyour
lives are not safe.â

I told her that our motive was by some means to
endeavour to effect her escape; she replied, it was
utterly impossible, she was too well guarded. âFarewell,
Henry,â said she, âfarewell for ever, for I believe
I will never see you again; it would have been happy
for us both if we had never seen each other.â

At this moment a female servant of Donna Annaâs,
who had accompanied Maria, came to speak to her,
and recognizing Henry, she flew up stairs. Maria saw
that we were discovered, and she cried to us, âFly for
your lives!â The whole family collected, were now
descending the stairs, and Maria was hurried up to
her room. The old lady of the house assailed us with
the most abusive epithets, the men-servants gathered in,
[Pg 179]

and every thing wore a hostile appearance. The
gentleman, however, to whom the letter was directed,
commanded silence, and addressing us, âI do not
presume to say what your intentions may be towards
my ward, but being convinced of the identity of the
individual who has already caused us so much trouble,
I am forced, even against the laws of hospitality, to
retract my request of you to remain here to-night, and
for the safety of those committed to my charge, I must
insist on you returning immediately to your quarters.
If you have come here for the purpose of decoying
Maria from this house, I can tell you that whatever
inclination she once might have felt for this foolish
young man, she is now better advised, and does not
wish to be troubled with him any more.â

âLet me hear that from her own lips,â cried Henry
in a frenzied tone, âand I will give my word that I
shall never trouble her again.â

A short consultation was held by the family, and
after some minutes delay, Maria was brought down
stairs trembling and weeping. But all their endeavours
could not force her to repeat the words which they
wished her to say. At length, Henry, as if inspired
with more than his natural energy, exclaimed, âI find
that every fresh effort of mine only causes you additional
restraint and mortification. I must now cease to hopeâthey
have cruelly parted us in this world, Maria,
but we may yet meet. Suffer me,â said he, âto take a
last farewell, and I will trouble you no more.â

This was spoken with such an impassioned voice
and gesture, that it had a visible effect on those around.
Maria, who had been restrained by the lady of the
house, now broke from her, and fell into Henryâs arms.
While he pressed her to his bosom, a new spirit seemed
to animate himâhis eyes brightenedâand putting his
hand into his breast, where he had a pistol concealed,
âLet us carry her off, Joseph,â said he to me in English,
âor die in the attempt.â

âThen you will die before you reach the door,â said
I; for the house was now filled with the retainers of
[Pg 180]

the family; and as if they suspected his purpose, Maria
was torn shrieking from his arms.

Afraid that he might be induced to commit some
rash act, I hurried him out of the house, and we returned
home. I endeavoured to lead him into conversation,
but he appeared not to hear me, nor did he speak a
word during the journey; he evinced no feeling of any
kindâhis mind seemed to be in a state of the utmost
confusion.

Next morning the Portuguese boy brought him
intelligence that Maria had passed through the village
very early, escorted by her relations, on her way to a
nunnery, about three leagues distant, where she was
destined to remain until our army advanced.

This took place in a few days after, and they never
met again. Henryâs mind had been strained far beyond
its pitchâit was now unnervedâand he fell into a
state of listless melancholy from which he did not
recover for many months.

CHAPTER VIII.

During the time the army were in winter quarters,
great preparations were made for the campaign which
was about to open, and we could now muster an army
of about one hundred and thirty thousand men, namely,
forty thousand British, twenty thousand Portuguese,
and seventy thousand Spaniards,âthe two former in
the highest state of discipline, well clothed, and provided
with stores of every description. The old camp-kettles,
that were formerly carried on mules, were
exchanged for lighter ones, which the men could carry
on the top of their knapsacks; and the mules now
carried tents, which we had not been provided with
prior to this period. In fact, the whole arrangements
made reflected the highest honour on Lord Wellington.

The army commenced its advance on the 13th May,
1813, in three columns. The second division, commanded
by General Hill, formed the right, which was
[Pg 181]

destined to advance along the line of the Tagus. The
centre column, consisting of the fourth, sixth, seventh,
and light divisions, under the immediate command of
Lord Wellington, to advance by Salamanca. The left,
consisting of the first, third, and fifth divisions, under
the command of General Graham, to advance direct
through Portugal, taking the line of Benevente for
Burgos, and to be supported on the left by the Gallician
army. The centre column came up with the French
on the 26th May, and in a skirmish with their rear
guard, took two hundred prisoners. A junction was
here formed with General Hill, extending the line from
the Tormes to the Douro. The left, to which our
division belonged, passed the Elsa at Miranda de Douro
on the 31st May, Lord Wellington being present, and
advanced upon Zamora, when the French fell back
upon Toro. Passing Valladolid, we continued our
march upon Burgos, which the enemy evacuated on
the 13th of June, having first blown up the works;
thirty of the garrison perished by the explosion. The
retreat of the French had been so rapid during this
time, that our marches were often very severe, which,
together with the heat of the weather, and occasional
scarcity of water, caused many to get fatigued, and
unable to keep up with their regiment. Here again
the conduct of Colonel Lloyd was remarkable. By
every means in his power he encouraged and assisted
those who were weakly, taking their knapsacks from
them and carrying them on his own horse; sometimes
having half a dozen on it, and a man sitting above all,
while he walked on foot at the head of his regiment, in
the most difficult parts of the roadâat the same time,
inducing the other officers to follow his example.
Often when he saw an individual failing, through want
of strength, he has taken off his liquor flask and given
it to the poor fellow to drink, saying, âDonât let your
spirits down, my man; you will soon get strength, and
be able to keep up with the best of them; none of them
shall have to say that you fell to the rear.â

He had a most extensive and thorough knowledge
[Pg 182]

of his profession, added to an acquaintance with most
of the European languages. When he came into
camp he was never a moment idle, either reconnoitreing
the enemyâs position, or drawing charts of the roads,
&c. He scarcely allowed himself to rest, and was
always up an hour or two before the bugle sounded;
but he would never allow the men to be disturbed before
the proper time. âNo,â said he, âlet the poor fellows
get all the rest they can.â
But then
he expected them
to be alert; officers and men, without distinction, were
obliged to be in their respective places at once without
delayâall his motions were double-quickâand he
detested nothing so much as laziness.

General Picton, who had joined from England a
considerable time before, again commanded the division.
To judge from appearance, no one would have suspected
him of humour; yet he often indulged in it: his wit
was generally, however, of the satirical kind. On this
advance, a man belonging to one of the regiments of the
brigade who was remarkable for his mean, pilfering disposition,
had on some pretence lingered behind his regiment
when they marched out to the assembling ground,
and was prowling about from one house to another in
search of plunder. General Picton, who was passing
through, happened to cast his eye upon him, and called
out, âWhat are you doing there, sir? Why are you behind
your regiment?â The man, who did not expect to see
the general in the village, had not an answer very ready,
but he stammered out an excuse, saying, âI came back
to the house where I was quartered to look for my
gallowses,â (braces.) âAy, I see how it is,â replied the
general; âget along, sir, to your division, and take my
adviceâalways keep the word
gallows
in your mind.â

Having crossed the Ebro on the 16th, Lord
Wellington took up his quarters a few leagues from
Vittoria; and on the 19th we came up with the French,
who had taken a position in front of that town, their
left posted on a range of heights. Our army having
closed up on the 20th, on the morning of the 21st,
General Hillâs division commenced the battle, by attacking
[Pg 183]

their left on the heights of Puebla, and succeeded,
after a most desperate and sanguinary contest, in gaining
possession of them. When we descended the hill
towards the river, the second division was warmly
engaged, and the French commenced cannonading us
from a small white village in front of Vittoria, where
they had part of their army stationed. There was a
brigade of our guns directing their fire towards this
place when we were crossing the river along with the
seventh division. Our attention was drawn to a young
artillery officer who was with them, and who seemed
to be very much frightened; for every time that either
our own or the French guns fired, he ducked to the
ground. Some of the men felt inclined to make game
of him; but it only showed that fighting needs practice
before people can take things easy. It is likely that
it was the first time he had been engaged, and I have
no doubt but he would eventually get the better of that
custom. Those who have not known it by experience,
can form no idea of the indifference with which our
soldiers entered a battle after being some time in the
Peninsula. As an instance of this, we were at one
time lying opposite to the enemy, in daily expectation
of being engaged. One of our men, (a Highlandman,)
having lost the small piece of ornamented leather which
is worn in front of the uniform cap, on taking off his
hat for some purpose, the deficiency caught his eye,
and, looking at it for a few moments, he said, very
seriously, âI wish to God there may be an engagement
to-day, till I get a rosette for my cap.â

After crossing the river, our division advanced in
two lines upon the village where their artillery were
posted under a tremendous fire, and succeeded, after
an obstinate resistance, in dislodging them. The fourth
and light divisions having also crossed the river, advanced
upon the enemyâs centre. The French had
made sure of defeating us at this point; and it was said
that Joseph Buonaparte had erected a buttress on one
of the spires, for the purpose of seeing them drive us
back. But he was doomed to a severe disappointment;
[Pg 184]

for the second division having succeeded in driving the
French off the heights, they commenced their retreat
on the Burgos road, but were intercepted by General
Graham, with the left of our army; and after losing
several villages in succession, which they warmly contested,
they were at length compelled to abandon the
main road to France, (Joseph himself narrowly escaping,)
and take the road to Pampeluna, followed in
pursuit by the whole army; and such was their haste,
that they were obliged to abandon all their baggage
and guns, with the exception of one gun and one
howitzer. One hundred and fifty-one cannon, four
hundred and fifteen ammunition waggons, one hundred
other waggons, fourteen thousand rounds of ammunition,
two million ball cartridges, and forty thousand
pounds of powder, with the baggage and treasury
waggons, said to be worth Â£630,000, fell into our
hands.

The enemy lost ten thousand killed and wounded,
and one thousand nine hundred prisoners. The loss
on our side amounted to about three thousand killed
and wounded.

When we reached the town, passing to the left of it,
we found their baggage to the right of the road, lying
in the greatest confusion. The columns passed on, but
some of the stragglers who fell out got immense sums of
money out of the treasury waggons. Few of them
were much the better of it, however. I knew one man
who got to the amount of Â£2000 here, who was going
without shoes before we left the country. We passed
on some distance beyond Vittoria, and encamped; but
many of the men returned that night to the baggage,
and got money and valuables of every description.
The camp that night and next day was like a fair; and
the dollars and doubloons were flying about in every
direction.

The wounded were left in Vittoria, among whom
was a Captain Gââ of ours, who subsequently lost
his life in a melancholy manner. During his stay in
Vittoria, while recovering from his wounds, he had
[Pg 185]

become acquainted with a young lady, and, it was said,
had seduced her. Her brother who was an officer in
the Spanish army, having learned the circumstance,
vowed revenge; and one night, when on guard, he took
some of his men with him armed, and forced his way
into Captain Gâââs quarters, who was undressing
himself to go to bed. Hearing a noise, he seized his
sword, and coming out into the passage, he was
attacked by the Spaniards; but so well did he defend
himself, that they were fairly beaten out of the house,
and the door shut upon them. They had not been long
gone, however, when they returned, and endeavoured
to gain entrance. Captain Gââ had again left his
apartment to see what was the matter, and was
standing in the passage with his sword in his hand,
when they burst open the door, fired a volley at him,
and made their escape. One of the shots took effect,
and he fell, mortally wounded. We were very sorry
for him, for he was an excellent officer; and however
he might have been to blame otherwise, the base
manner in which he was assassinated excited the
indignation of the whole army. I never learned
whether any investigation took place, or any justice
was rendered by the Spanish government.

The rear of the French army entered Pampeluna on
the 24th, having previously lost their gun; and out of
their whole artillery, they had now only left one
solitary howitzer. Never was an army so discomfited.
They were so confident of success, that they had made
no provision for a retreat.

Having left a garrison in Pampeluna, they proceeded
to retreat by the road of Roncesvalles, and we invested
Pampeluna on the 26th. We were in camp for a day
or two here; and during that time, a party of our
regiment relieved a Spanish picquet on a hill above
our encampment. It had rained during the night,
and the picquetâs arms, which were piled in front of
the tent, had got a little rusty. Being fatigued, they
had neglected to clean them. Colonel Lloyd, who was
ever on the alert, particularly when near the enemy,
[Pg 186]

having paid them a visit very early in the morning,
took notice of their arms; but, without passing any
remark, he called the sergeant, who, thinking that he
wished to inspect the picquet, ordered them to turn out.
âNever mind falling in,â said the colonel; âI only called
to ask why you did not make those Spaniards whom you
relieved last night take their arms with them.â The
sergeant who did not see through the sarcasm, replied,
that the Spaniards did take their arms with them.

âAnd pray, whose arms are these?â

âThe picquetâs arms,â replied the sergeant.

âPoh! nonsense! you donât intend to make me
believe these arms belong to British soldiers. Send for
the Spaniards, and make them take away their arms.â
So saying, he walked down the hill. Each man felt
his honour implicated, and the colonel had not gone
many paces when they were all busy cleaning their
muskets. It was in this manner that he could convey
severe reproof, and endear himself to his men at the
same time.

From this place we marched across the country to
Sanguessa, and on the march I was left on duty, which
detained me behind the regiment. In my route to join
them I had halted for the day with my party at a house
a short distance off the road. There was a wood to
the rear of the house, and we had not long taken up
our quarters, when I perceived a lady galloping from it
with great speed down a by-path towards us. As she
approached I observed that her dress was in great
disorder, her face stained with blood, and she held a
pistol in her hand, with which she urged on her horse.
I was struck with surprise on seeing a lady in such trim,
and did not know well what to think of her, when she
reined up her horse at the door, and before I had time
to assist her, sprung to the ground, and replacing the
pistol in the holster, removed the saddle from her
horse, and turned him loose to graze; then sitting
down, she drew forth a small pocket mirror, and began
to arrange her dishevelled tresses. As a favour she
asked me to procure her a little water, and when I had
[Pg 187]

brought itââThank you,â said she, âI believe I stand
in need of this, for I have had a severe scuffle and a
brisk gallop. I am on my way to join the Spanish
army, and although eager to get forward, I could not
persuade my lazy servants to dispense with their usual

siesta
, and when the fellows went to sleep I left them
and pushed forward myself; but I had not travelled far
when I was stopped by three brigands, who, seizing
my horseâs bridle, demanded my money. Powder and
shot are more plentiful with me than money in these
times, and I drew out a pistol and sent a ball through
the fellowâs head who asked itâhe fell, and I urged
forward my horse; but one of the villains still held by
the bridle, and I was near unhorsed. Having another
pistol left, I lost no time in making him relax his hold.
My horse was now free, and sprung forward with me;
but a bullet from the surviving robber nearly stopped
my flight, for it grazed my cheek here,â said she, pointing
to a slight wound which she was bathing with the
cold water: âit was a narrow escape, certainly.â I
was not a little surprised at the
sang froid
with which
she described the imminent danger she had been in,
and could not sufficiently admire her courage and
presence of mind; but I ceased to wonder, when her
servants coming up a short time after, told me that I
had been conversing with the
heroine of Saragossa
.

In half an hour after they arrived, she again set
forward. I had seen her before at Cadiz; but I did
not recollect her features. Every one has read or
heard of her conduct at Saragossa; it will, therefore, be
needless for me to recapitulate it here.

Having remained in camp at Sanguessa a few days,
we returned, and were quartered in a small village,
called Olaz, about three miles from Pampeluna, sending
out working parties to the batteries which were
forming against the town.

General Graham having pushed on by the sea side
as far as Passages, and General Hill having dislodged
the enemy on the rightâthe whole had now retired
into France.

[Pg 188]

We remained in this place until the 25th of August,
when Soult having hastily collected an army of forty
thousand men, made a furious attack on the fourth
division. Our division advanced to their support, but
not being able to keep our ground against such a force
as they had brought up, the whole were obliged to
retreat precipitately that night upon Huarte, where a
position was taken up by the army. On the 27th they
made a desperate attack on the left of our line, where
we had possession of a hill, which they made repeated
attempts to gain possession of, but without successâfor
whenever they drove in our skirmishers, so as to
reach the top, the regiments stationed to defend it came
forward, and having poured a volley into them, charged
them down the hill with dreadful slaughter.

On the 28th they again attempted it, but with like
success. A desperate attack was then made on the
fourth division, but they charged with the bayonet,
and repulsed the enemy with immense loss. On the
29th Soult manÅuvred to turn our left; but on the
30th, our army in turn attackedâthe seventh division
their right, our division their left, and the other
divisions their centreâwhen they were defeated and
fled in all directions, losing in their retreat many
prisoners, among whom were a number of raw conscripts,
who had not been four months enlisted.

During the time we lay in position, the French
occupied a hill on one side, while our division were
posted on a rise opposite, a small valley being between;
in this valley there was a sort of entrenchment formed,
where our picquets lay. It could be of little use to
either side, as it was exposed to the fire of both armies;
but the French, out of bravado, determined on taking
it, and selected a party for that purpose. A brave
fellow of an officer headed them, and came cheering
down the hill; our men did not incommode themselves
in the least, until they were so near that they could
take a sure aim, when those in the rear of the entrenchment
starting up, saluted them with a volley of musketry
that brought down an immense number, among others
[Pg 189]

the officer, who was some way in front: whenever
they saw him fall, they turned to the right-about, and
ascended the hill, leaving him on the ground. We felt
sorry for the fate of the brave fellow who had led them,
and reprehended the cowardly scoundrels who had left
him.

It is a peculiar feature of the British soldier, that
his bravery does not depend on that of his officers,
although, no doubt, it may be stimulated by the
presence and example of a good oneâI never knew it
to fail through their bad conduct.

From this we followed the French by the road of
Roncesvalles, and took up our encampment on one of
the Pyrenees, above that village so much renowned in
Spanish poetry. In our ascent we found a number of
half-burnt bodies lying on the mountain side, being
those of the enemy who had been killed in the preceding
engagement, and whom they thus disposed of.
When we reached the top of the hill, we found ourselves
enveloped in mist; and during the few days we remained
on it, it was so thick that we durst not move
from the camp for water, without forming a chain of
men to guide us back. From this place we removed,
and were posted on the heights above the village of
Maya, occupying the ground from which part of our
advanced posts were driven back on the 25th; the
scene of action being marked out by the dead bodies
lying about, and the ground strewed with the fragments
of clothing, particularly the tartan dress of one of our
Highland regiments.

Being relieved by other troops, we descended the
mountain, and were encamped near the village of
Ariscune. While here, one of the 83d regiment was
shot for desertion; he had deserted when we formed
the advance at the Maya pass, and having come out
with some of the French generals to reconnoitre our
position, they were attacked by a picquet of our cavalry,
when the French officers decamped, leaving the deserter
behind. He was then taken, and being subsequently
tried by a general court-martial, was sentenced to be
[Pg 190]

shot. He blamed the tyrannical conduct of the officer
commanding his company, and the pay-sergeant, for
being the cause of his desertion,âthat they had taken
ill-will at him on some account, and rendered his life
so miserable, that he was driven to the desperate step
which ended in his death. Whether his statement
was true, I cannot say, but his comrades were inclined
to think it was.

During this time General Graham besieged and took
St Sebastian.

While we were here, I was sent on command with a
letter to General Hill, whose division now occupied
the heights above Roncesvalles. In going from the
one place to the other, I had to travel about six miles
through a by-path, on the ridge of one of the Pyrenees,
and my imagination was struck in a peculiar manner by
the awful grandeur of the scenery; yet I could not
help feeling horror at the death-like stillness that
reigned around me. I felt myself as it were lifted out
of the worldâI saw nor heard not any living thing but
a huge vulture, who stood upright on a rock by the
road side, looking at me as I passed, without seeming
the least disturbed at my presenceâhe rather seemed
to eye me as an invader of his solitary domain. I tried
to startle him by making a noise, but he disdained to
move; at length, when it suited his own pleasure, he
slowly expanded his broad wings, and rising a few
yards from the ground, hovered for some time immediately
above my head, and then soared out of sight.
Having ascended the mountain, I found the second
division encamped on nearly the same ground that
we had formerly occupied, and enveloped in mist as we
had been. The place where General Hill and his
staff were encamped was surrounded by a small intrenchment,
inside of which the tents were pitched,
and a kind of log-house built in the centre, to serve as
a mess room. Judging from the proud and haughty
bearing of some of our ensigns, in coming into the
presence of the general second in command of the
British army, I expected to be annihilated by his look,
[Pg 191]

and I was ushered into the mess room to deliver my
message with a palpitating heart; but I no sooner saw
the humane and benevolent-looking countenance of the
general, than my apprehensions vanished. Having
read the letter, he questioned me concerning the health
of the commanding officer, and asked me questions
concerning our regiment, (of which he was colonel,) in
the kindliest and most unaffected manner; then calling
one of his servants, he ordered him to provide me
liberally in meat and drink. Some time after, seeing
me standing outside the tent, he called me, and asked
whether the servants had paid attention to me. Next
morning, on giving me a letter for my commanding
officer, âI did not intend,â said he, âthat you should
have returned so soon, but we are going to remove
down to the valley, and as it would be only taking
you out of your road, it will be as well for you to
proceed; but there is no necessity that you should go
farther than the small village two leagues from this.
I will give directions to my orderly dragoon to procure
you a billet there, and to-morrow you can join your
regiment.â He then ordered his servant to fill my
haversack with provision; and when I was going
away, he said, âRemember now what I have told you,âdonât
go farther than the village; and here is something
for you to get yourself a refreshment when you
arrive there.â

These circumstances have no particular interest in
themselves, to render them worth reciting, only that
they serve to show the amiable disposition of a general,
whose character for bravery and skill is too well known
to the public to need any eulogium of mine. It was
this feeling and humane disposition, and attention to
their interests, that caused him to be so much beloved
by the troops under his command, and gained for him
the appellation of father,ââDaddy Hillâ being the
name he was called by in his division.

[Pg 192]

CHAPTER IX.

From Ariscune we again moved, and occupied the
heights above Maya, from whence we advanced in the
beginning of October, and drove the French outposts
back into the valley, at the same time burning their
huts. While engaged at this business, there fell a
tremendous shower of hailstones, some of them measuring
five inches in circumference. The regiment got
partially under cover in a small chapel, but those with
the baggage were exposed, and many were hurt severely.
On this day the left of our army succeeded in crossing
the Bidasoa.

On returning from this affair, we ascended the heights
above the village of Zaggaramurdi, where we encamped.
From this part of the Pyrenees we had a view of
France, and the position of the French army, which
occupied a line, their right resting on the sea-port of
St Jean de Luz, and the left on St Jean Pied de Port:
here they had formed an intrenched camp, and had redoubts
on each hill along the whole line.

We remained on this ground until the 10th of November,
during which time the weather was severeâthe
wind often blowing with such violence that the tents
could not be kept pitched.

From a precipice above our encampment, we could
view the sea, and the towns along the coast. It was
now three years since we beheld it, during which time
our hopes and wishes had often fondly turned to our
native homes; each fresh campaign and each battle
was reckoned the precursor of our return, but âby
expectation every day beguiled,â we had almost begun
to despair of ever beholding it again, when our recent
successes, and the sight of the ocean which encircled
the land of our birth, produced the most lively hopes
and pleasing anticipations. A more than common
friendly feeling was displayed amongst us; each saw in
his comradeâs face the reflection of the joy that animated
his own heart. The mountain air braced our nerves,
[Pg 193]

and gave us a bounding elasticity of spirit, which rose
superior to every thing.

A few of us who were drawn together by congeniality
of sentiment and disposition, used to assemble and
wander up among the giant cliffs with which we were
surrounded, and perching ourselves in a cranny, would
sit gazing on the ocean and ships passing, with emotions
which I have felt, but cannot describe. Its expansive
bosom seemed a magic mirror, wherein we could read
our future fortune,âa happy return from all our dangers;
smiling friends, with all the early loved associations
of childhood and youth, swam before our hope-dazzled
imaginations, and we sat and sung the songs
of Scotland while the tears trickled down our cheeks.
He who has never heard the melodies of his native land
sung in a foreign country, is ignorant of a pleasure that
nothing can surpass. But we were not all doomed to
realise those pleasing anticipations: many found their
graves in the valleys which we then overlooked.

Lord Wellington having prepared every thing for an
attack on the French position in the valley, on the 10th
of November, about two oâclock in the morning, we
assembled, and having marched down to the foot of
the hill, on a signal given by a gun firing, the attack
commenced; that on the enemyâs left was made
under the direction of General Hill, by the second and
sixth divisions, supported by a division of Portuguese
and Spaniards. Marshal Beresford commanded the
centre, consisting of our division, the fourth and seventh,
supported by a division of Spaniards.

The enemy having been driven from the redoubts in
front of Sarre, we advanced upon the village. Our
regiment being selected to charge a strong column that
protected the bridge, Colonel Lloyd filed us off from the
division, and led us on to the attack in the most heroic
manner. Having succeeded in carrying it with considerable
loss on our part, we returned and took up
our place in the column. In a short time after, having
passed through the village, the whole army co-operating,
we advanced to the attack of the enemyâs main position
[Pg 194]

on the heights behind it, on which a line of strong
redoubts were formed, with abattis in front, formed by
trees cut down and placed with their branches towards
us, serving as a cover for their infantry. Having extended
our line at the foot of the hill, our division proceeded
to the attack: Colonel Lloyd having pushed his horse
forward before the regiment, advanced cheering on
his men with the most undaunted braveryâbut before
he reached its summit, he received a mortal wound in
the breast, and was only saved from falling off his horse
by some of the men springing forward to his assistance.
When this was perceived by the regiment, a pause
of a moment was made in the midst of their career, and
the tears started into each eye as they saw him borne
down the hill; but the next was devoted to revenge,
and regardless of every thing, they broke through all
obstacles, and driving the enemy from their position,
they charged them through their burning huts without
mercy. The troops to our right and left having carried
the other redoubts, the enemy were obliged to surrender
the strong position which they had taken; and in the
principal redoubt on the right, they left the first battalion
of their 88th regiment, which surrendered.

The troops under General Hill having succeeded in
forcing them from their positions on the right of our
army, our division and the seventh moved by the left
of the Nivelle, on St Pe, covered by the second and sixth
divisions. A part of the enemyâs troops had crossed,
and advancing, gained possession of the height above
it. Our centre and right columns were now established
behind the enemyâs right; but night came on,
and we were obliged to cease firing. Having encamped,
intelligence was brought up of the death of Colonel
Lloyd: he had been carried to a house at the foot of
the hill, where he expired in a few minutes.

Thus fell the brave and noble Lloyd, in the vigour
of manhood and the height of his fame, for his worth
and services were well known, and duly appreciated
by Lord Wellington. Though young, his extraordinary
abilities had caused him to rise rapidly in the
[Pg 195]

service, and had attracted the admiration of the army
in which he served; while his humanity and wise system
of discipline endeared him to those he commanded.
Humble though thy grave be, gallant Lloyd, and
though no sculptured marble rises oâer thy tomb, thine
is a nobler meed: thy virtues are engraven on many a
heart, which nothing but the rude hand of death can
eâer efface; and though no pageantry followed thy
remains to the grave, honest heart-felt tears were shed
upon it.

I never witnessed sorrow so general as that produced
by the intelligence of his death; our hearts were fullâwe
felt as if we had lost a fatherâall his good qualities
were recapitulated, and tears were shed in abundance
during the recital.

Had any of those overbearing officers who carry all
with a high hand and by dint of severity, witnessed the
feeling displayed that night among the men of our
regiment, they would have forsworn tyranny for ever.
One individual only exulted in his death, and that was
the captain of yellow and black badge celebrity, whom
I have already had occasion to mention; he considered
that Colonel Lloydâs promotion into our regiment had
hindered his own, and as the goodness which some men
cannot imitate causes their hate, so it was with him.
When he received intelligence of Colonel Lloydâs death,
snapping his fingers in a manner peculiar to himself,
he exclaimed, âThey have been licking the butter off
my bread for some time, but I think I have them
now.â

This unfeeling expression becoming known in the
regiment, caused him more detestation even than his
former cruelty.

The enemy retired from the position on their right
that night, and quitting also their position and works
in front of St Jean de Luz, retired upon Bidart,
destroying the bridges on the lower Nivelle. In the
course of the preceding day we had taken fifty-one
piece of cannon, six ammunition tumbrils, and one
thousand four hundred prisoners.

[Pg 196]

In consequence of the rapid movements of the division,
the baggage had not come up, and as it rained
heavy, we were rather uncomfortably situated. Next
day we moved forward a short distance, through
dreadfully dirty roads, but the enemy having retired
into an intrenched camp before Bayonne, we halted
and again encamped, when the baggage joined us.
Some of them had been nearly taken by the French
during the preceding night; our division being farther
advanced than the enemyâs right, they were uncertain
where to direct their march. The corporal of our band,
(a Glasgow lad,) coming up that evening with the
baggage, observed a poor woman of the 88th regiment
endeavouring to raise the ass that carried her necessaries,
out of a hole it had fallen into. As it was
getting dark, and the baggage had all passed, the poor
woman was in a miserable plight, and begged of him
to assist her. She could not have applied to one more
willing to succour a person in distress, and setting to
work, after a good deal of trouble, he got the âboricoâ
on its feet, but so much time had elapsed that the
baggage was now out of hearing, and they were uncertain
which way to proceed. After travelling some
distance, they heard bugles sounding to their left, and
they kept on in that direction, until they found themselves
in the midst of some regiments of Spaniards, but
who could give them no information respecting the
position of our division. Pointing, however, to where
they suspected them to be, our travellers continued
their route in that direction; but the poor ass was so
fatigued, that it lay down every now and then under
its burden. Assisting it on in the best way they could,
the road they had taken brought them between two
hills, on which they perceived the fires of different
encampments. When they arrived opposite them, they
suspected from their relative position, that one must be
the enemy, but which of them they knew not; they
were now in a dilemma, and to add to it, the poor ass
tumbled headlong into a stream that ran through the
valley, and their united efforts could not raise it.
[Pg 197]

Pâââs spirit of knight-errantry was now fast evaporating,
and he was almost tempted to swear that he
would never again be caught succouring distressed
damsels, when the woman, whose invention was
sharpened by the exigency of her situation, proposed
that she would creep softly up the hill, until she came
within hearing of the soldiers in the camp, and from
their language she would be able to learn whether they
were our troops or the enemy. She then ascended the
hill that she considered the most likely to be the
encampment of our troops, leaving poor Pââ sitting
beside the half-drowned animal, to whose name he was
inclined to think the transactions of that night gave
him some claim. After waiting a considerable time in
anxious suspense, he was beginning to forget his selfish
considerations, in concern for the safety of the poor
woman who had thus ventured on a forlorn hope, when
his attention was attracted by some one descending the
hill waving a light backwards and forwards, and shouting
at the same time; having answered the signal, the
woman soon made her appearance, with a Portuguese
soldier, whose division was encamped on the hill which
she ascended, and they now learned that those on the
opposite hill were the French. Having succeeded in
raising the half-perished âburo,â the Portuguese lifted the
baggage on his back, and the others half dragging, half
carrying the animal, they reached the top of the hill, but
still no information could be got of the division. Considering
it of no use to proceed farther, they seated
themselves by a fire, but they had scarcely done so,
when it came on a heavy shower of rain which drenched
them to the skinâthere was no remedy, however, but
patience. Next morning at daylight they again took
the road, but they were now more fortunate, for falling
in with some of the baggage they had parted with the
preceding night, they reached the division by the
time we had encamped.

During our campaigns in the Peninsula, it is almost
incredible what the poor women who followed us had
to endure, marching often in a state of pregnancy, and
[Pg 198]

frequently bearing their children in the open air, in
some instances, on the line of march, by the roadside;
suffering at the same time, all the privation to
which the army is liable. In quarters, on the other
hand, they were assailed by every temptation which
could be thrown in their way, and every scheme laid
by those who had rank and money, to rob them of that
virtue which was all they had left to congratulate
themselves upon. Was it to be wondered at, then, if
many of them were led astray, particularly when it is
considered that their starving condition was often taken
advantage of by those who had it in their power to
supply them, but who were villains enough to make
their chastity the price?

From this encampment we advanced to Ustaritz,
where we remained until the 9th of December, when
we crossed the Nive. At the point we passed, we
met with little or no opposition, but some of the army
were warmly engaged. We then took up our quarters
in Hasparin. The day that we entered this village, one
of our men cut off his right hand, under circumstances
that may be worth relating.

For some time previous to this he had been low in
spirits, troubled with what some people call
religious
melancholy
, but which, at that time, was no very prevalent
disease in the army. He scarcely ever spoke to
any one, and was in the habit of wandering out from
the encampment, with his Bible in his pocket, and
seating himself in some place where he was not likely
to be disturbed, he would sit for hours poring over it.
While in Ustaritz, he conceived some ill will against
the landlord of the house where he was quartered, and
very unceremoniously knocked him down. Being
confined for this offence, he remained a prisoner when
we entered Hasparin. On the guard being placed in a
house, he sat down, and having taken out his Bible, he
commenced reading it. But suddenly rising, he laid
down the book, and going over to a man who was breaking
wood with a hatchet, he asked the loan of it for a few
minutes. When the man gave it to him, he walked
[Pg 199]

very deliberately into an inner apartment, and placing
his right hand on the sill of the window, he severed it
at the wrist. The first two strokes that he made did
not finish the business, and he had nerve enough not
only to repeat it a third time, but afterwards to wrench
the lacerated integuments asunder, and throw the hand
into the court below. He had been observed by some
of the men in a window opposite, but too late to prevent
the deed.

I assisted in leading him to the assistant-surgeonâs
quarters, where the stump was dressed in a manner
which I shall describe, and leave to the profession
either to praise or censure, as they may feel inclined.
The bone had been rather splintered than cut, and its
sharp point protruded about two inches beyond the
mangled integuments. Having prepared his apparatus,
he placed the patient on a seat, and after half-an-hourâs
poking with a tenacalum, he succeeded in taking up and
tying the two principal arteries. He then nipt off the
rough angles at the point of the bone, and forcing down
the retracted integuments by straps of adhesive plaster,
under which he had introduced some dry lint, he rolled
the whole up with a bandage, and left him, congratulating
himself, no doubt, on his dexterity.

The man, on being questioned as to his motive in
thus mutilating himself, replied, âthat he had only done
what the Lord commanded, in a passage he had been
reading,âIf thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and
cast it from thee,â &c., which injunction he had literally
fulfilled, as his right hand offended him by knocking
down his landlord. This was the only reason he ever
assigned. As he went to the rear some time after, and
did not join the regiment again, I had never an opportunity
of learning whether the operation proved successful.

From the village of Hasparin we were removed
about a mile, to the deserted palace of some Gascon
nobleman, where we were quartered until the 6th of
January, when we advanced, and drove in the enemyâs
outposts; but returning on the 7th, we did not again
move until the middle of February.

[Pg 200]

While in Hasparin the weather was bad, and we
were much harassed, marching a distance of two or
three miles every morning to the alarm-post two hours
before daylight, and remaining there until it appeared.
The inhabitants of the province we were now in were
different in dress and manners from both Spaniards
and French, but their language (Patois) seemed to our
ears harsh and discordant. The round bonnets of the
men, and the dress and healthy look of the women,
was much similar to the Scottish peasantry.

I am not certain whether it was here or in Ustaritz,âthe
latter, I believe,âthat we had two men of our
division executed; one hanged for robbing an officerâs
portmanteau, and another shot for presenting his empty
piece at a sergeant of the mounted police corps, which
acted as assistants to the provost marshal, and had
been attached to the army since the commencement of
the last campaign. Every one thought he would be
pardoned, or at least his sentence commuted, as it was
said there was some unnecessary provocation given by
the sergeant; but mercy was not extended to him.
We were often inclined to think that the provosts
marshal were possessed of more power than they ought
to have had, particularly as they were generally men
of a description who abused it, and were guided more
by caprice and personal pique than any regard to
justice. In fact, they seemed to be above all control,
doing what they pleased, without being brought to any
account, and were often greater robbers than the men
they punished.

After leaving this place, we came up with the French
on the 23d of February, near the village of Sauveterre.
A river ran between us and the town, over which there
was a bridge that they had placed in a state of defence,
their army occupying the opposite bank. On the
morning of the 24th, our brigade were ordered some
way down from the bridge, for the purpose of crossing
a ford near a mill. Our light companies, covered by
a party of the seventh hussars, first took the river, in a
particular part of which there was a strong current,
[Pg 201]

caused by the mill stream. This, together with the
large round stones that formed the bottom, caused some
difficulty in getting across; but they effected it, and
advancing up the bank through a narrow lane, lined a
wall on the top of the height. The cavalry then
returned, and the right of the brigade had crossed the
river, when the enemy, having detached a strong force
to oppose our progress, drove in the light troops so
precipitately, that in retreating through the lane already
mentioned, they were wedged in so closely that they
could not move. A number then struck off to the
right, and attempted to swim the river, but being
carried away with the current, many of them were
drowned. Of those who crossed at the ford many were
wounded in the river, and losing their footing sunk to
rise no more, among whom was a brave young officer
of our regiment. The French had by this time come
close down on them, and none would have escaped
being killed or taken prisoners had not a brigade of
guns been brought down to the edge of the river, and
by a heavy fire of grape covered the retreat. On re-crossing,
the brigade withdrew under cover of some
houses, and on the 25th the division crossed the river
on a bridge of boats, the enemy having blown up the
stone bridge, and retreated.

In the affair on the 24th a great number of our men
were taken prisoners, exclusive of the killed and
wounded. On the 27th, we came up with the enemy
again at Orthes, where their whole army had taken up
a position, their left resting on the village and heights
of Orthes, and right extending to that of St Boes. The
right of our line was composed of the third and sixth
divisions, led on by General Picton; the light division,
under Baron Alten, formed the centre; and Marshal
Beresford, with the fourth and seventh, formed the left.
The battle commenced by the latter attacking St Boes
and carrying it; but by reason of the difficult nature
of the ground, it was found impracticable to carry the
heights. Their whole line was then attacked by the
third, fourth, sixth, and light divisions, when the enemy
[Pg 202]

were dislodged from the heights; and Sir Rowland
Hill, who, in advancing to join the conflict, saw the
French already routed, the more effectually to prevent
their escape, pushed forward the second division and
cavalry. Their retreat was well conducted at first, but
it gradually became disorderly, and in the end a complete
flight, many of the conscripts throwing down
their arms and deserting.

The French had made a most obstinate resistance at
the point which we had to carry, and kept up a severe
cannonade on us, by which many of our men were decapitated,
in consequence of their firing chain shot. In
one part of the road where they had been driven from
the fields, our cavalry had made a furious charge on
them, and taken a number of prisoners. The road was
almost rendered impassable by the number of arms
lying on it. Near this place lay a sergeant belonging
to our light brigade, extended by the side of a French
grenadier, their bayonets transfixed in each other, and
both dead. Passing Orthes, we followed the retreat
of the enemy until we passed through another town,
where part of their rear-guard lined the walls of a
churchyard, situated a little above the town, and had
brought out tables and chairs to stand on while they
fired over upon us. In passing through this village, a
shot from one of their cannon shattered the leg of an
old midwife while she was crossing the street; the head
doctor of our regiment, a skilful and intelligent surgeon,
being passing at the time, having inspected the injury,
found it necessary to amputate the limb, and although
she was far advanced in years, in three weeks after,
when we had occasion to pass near the village, she had
almost entirely recovered.

Beyond this village, about two miles, we encamped
by the road side, and had not been long encamped,
when my friend, the corporal of the band, whom I have
already mentioned, arrived, bringing with him a child
which he had found in a field under peculiar circumstances.
As he and a musician of the 83d regiment
were passing along the road, they were attracted by
[Pg 203]

the piteous cries of a French officer, who lay severely
wounded in a ditch a short distance from them; he
begged for Godâs sake that they would give him a drink,
and as I have already hinted, Pââ, always ready to
follow the dictates of a benevolent heart, gave him some
wine from his canteen. It was then dusk, but while
he stooped to give the officer the wine, he perceived
something moving beneath his cloak, and on drawing
it a little aside, he found a fine boy, about four years
old, dressed in the English fashion, nestled in beside
him. Taking him up in his arms, he asked him his
name, when the child replied, âJames.â The officer
entered into an explanation of the matter, and Pââ understood
enough of the language to learn that the
child came up the road during a heavy fire, while our
army and the French were engaged. The officer, who
had been wounded a little before, seeing the poor child
in imminent danger, and in the midst of his own sufferings,
feeling interested for his fate, had enticed him off
the road, and kept him amused until he fell asleep,
when he wrapped him in the corner of his cloak. The
officer expressed the utmost gratitude for Pâââs kindness
in giving him the wine, but he seemed to feel in
parting with the child, nor did the child seem very
willing to part with him. With the view, however, of
finding out his parents, the child was brought home to
the camp, and notice being sent to the different divisions
of the army, in a few days the childâs mother
arrived. Her feelings on again finding her child, may
be better imagined than described. She stated, that
having come into the town in rear of where the army
were engaged, the child had wandered from her knee
while she was suckling a younger one, and that she
had searched every part of the town for him without
being able to get the least trace of the direction he had
taken, or what had become of him.

Having children certainly increased the hardships
that the poor women were fated to endure; but excess
of suffering, which tore asunder every other tie, only
rendered maternal love stronger, and it was amazing
[Pg 204]

what hardships were voluntarily endured for the sake
of their offspring. I remember one poor fellow of our
brigade, whose wife died, and left an infant with him
of a few months old, and although he might have got
one of the women to take care of it, he preferred taking
charge of it himself, and for many a day he trudged
along with it sitting on the top of his knapsack. Sickness
at length overtook him, and he went to the rear
to hospital, carrying the child with him, but what was
their fate afterwards I have never been able to learn.

Next morning we left our encampment, and returning
by the way we had come, we passed a man of the
division on the road side, who had been hung up to the
branch of a tree a few minutes before. According to
the current report in the division, he had entered a
mill, and asked the miller to sell him some flour, but
the miller refusing to sell it, he took it by force; and
being caught in the act by some one, who reported the
affair to Lord Wellington, he was tried by a general
court martial, and sentenced to death. For a long
time after his trial, he was marched a prisoner with
the provost guard, and he entertained hopes of pardon;
but on that morning, without any previous warning,
while he was sitting at the fire with some of his fellow-prisoners,
the provost came in and ordered him to rise,
when placing the rope round his neck, he marched him
forward on the road a short distance, and hung him up
on the branch of a tree. Examples, perhaps, were
necessary, but we were inclined to think that the time
was often unfortunately chosen; it was rather an
awkward sort of spectacle to greet the eyes of an army
the morning after a hard-fought and successful battle:
and the poor wretchâs fate excited more commiseration
that morning, than detestation of his crime.

Some of the men happened to make remarks on the
subject,ââPshaw!â said Dennis, who was listening to
them, âI donât believe my countryman would do anything
of the sort. Sure itâs only a dead man he has
ordered to be hung up to frighten yees.â

âHe is dead enough now,â said another. âDo you
[Pg 205]

remember,â said a third, âthe tickler of a circular that
was served out to us after the dreadful retreat from
Salamanca,âwas
that
your countrymanâs doings?â

âTroth, I donât know,â said Dennis; âbut it didnât
go well down with us; and if this is the sort of payment
we get for beating the French, the best way is to go
down on our knees, and promise never to be guilty of the
like again.â

CHAPTER X.

In consequence of the wet weather, we were unable to
proceed, and lay in camp near this place about three
weeks; and little of any moment occurred during that
time, except the capture of Aire on the 2d of March,
by General Hillâs division.

On the 18th March, the enemy having retired in the
night upon Vic Bigorre, we advanced on the 19th, and
came up with their rear-guard, which was posted in
great force in the vineyards in front of that town.
Our division, under General Picton, advanced up the
main road to the attack, until the enemyâs artillery,
which commanded it, forced us to strike into the fields
to the right and left, when we drove them from one
field to another, while they contested every inch of the
ground with the greatest obstinacy, at every hedge and
ditch giving us a volley as we came up, and then
retreating to the next fence. While advancing upon
one of these temporary defences, a French soldier
through some cause, was rather tardy in retreating, and
our men were close upon him before he started out of
the ditch. His comrades had, by this time, lined the
fence farther on, and being a remarkable object, a
number of our skirmishers directed their fire against
him; but he did not seem much incommoded, for after
running a few paces, he turned on his pursuers: and
reloading his piece, continued this running fire for some
distance. His daring conduct having attracted the
attention of all, a great number joined in trying to bring
the poor fellow down, and the shot was flying about
[Pg 206]

him in every direction; but he seemed invulnerable.
At length, coming near to where his own party was
under cover, he walked up to the edge of the embankment,
and after firing at the party who were in his rear,
he clapped his hand very contemptuously on his breech,
and jumped down into the ditch. Those to the left of
the road, being brought to a point by a river, were
obliged to cross the main road, where they suffered
severely. A sergeant of our brigade received a dreadful
wound hereâa cannon shot having struck him, carried
away the fleshy part of the thigh, leaving the bone
perfectly bare, to the extent of twelve or fourteen inches.
A little farther on, a lad belonging to the band of the
eighty-third regiment lay killed. The band in general
accompanied the baggage, but he never would submit
to this; and when near the enemy, he always did duty
with the light company.

Having driven the enemy from the vineyards, in
retreating through the town they killed a number of our
men, from various places they had got under cover.
One poor fellow of the fifth regiment received a shot,
which, passing through his temples, cut the strings of
his eyes, and we saw him sitting on a stone with them
hanging out of their sockets. The whole of our army
having assembled that night at Vic Bigorre and
Rabastains, the enemy retired in the night upon Tarbes,
and we came up with their advanced posts in that town
on the 20th; their centre and left had retired, and
their right was attacked by the sixth division under
General Clinton, while General Hill attacked the hill
by the high road from Vic Bigorre.

The sixth division being successful, General Hill
passed through the town, and disposed his columns for
attack, when the enemy retreated in all directions,
having suffered severely, while our loss was but trifling.
Following them up the Garonne as far as Grenada, on
the 8th of April a pontoon bridge was thrown across,
and the eighteenth hussars, with a Portuguese and
Spanish brigade, crossed, and drove in a body of the
enemyâs cavalry, taking about a hundred prisoners.

[Pg 207]

The town of Toulouse is surrounded on three sides
by the canal of Languedoc and the Garonne. They
had fortified the suburbs on the left of that river with
strong field works; they had likewise formed works at
each bridge of the canal, defended by artillery and
musketry. Beyond the canal to the eastward, and
between that and the river Ers, there is a range of
heights extending for some distance, over which pass
all the roads to the canal and town from the eastward,
which it defends; and the enemy, in addition to the
outworks at the bridges of the canal, had fortified the
heights with five redoubts connected by lines of intrenchments;
they had also broken all the bridges over the
river Ers within our reach, by which the right of their
position could be approached. When the Spanish
corps passed, the pontoon bridge was moved higher up,
in order to shorten the communication with General
Hillâs division, and this was done so late on the evening
of the 9th, that the attack was delayed till next day.

Our division crossed on the evening of the 9th, and
next morning, the troops under Marshal Beresford
attacked the enemyâs right, while the Spaniards under
General Frere assailed the centre; but the latter were
soon repulsed, and being, with a heavy loss, driven
from the ground, were pursued to some distance. By
the exertions of their officers, however, they were
formed anew, when our light division, which was
immediately on their right, took up their place. In the
meantime, Beresford, with the fourth and sixth divisions,
attacked and carried the heights on the enemyâs
right, and the redoubt, which covered and protected
that flank, and lodged his troops in the redoubt. The
enemy, however, still occupied the others. As soon as
the Spaniards had re-formed, and were brought back
to the attack, General Beresford continued his march
along the ridge, and carried, with General Packâs
brigade, the two principal redoubts, and the fortified
houses in the enemyâs centre. The enemy made a
desperate effort from the canal to regain those redoubts,
but were repulsed with considerable loss; and the
[Pg 208]

sixth division continuing their movement along the
ridge, and the Spanish troops on the front, the enemy
were driven from all their redoubts and intrenchments
on the left, and the whole range of heights were in our
possession.

While these operations were going on on the left,
General Hill drove the enemy from their exterior works
in the suburb on the left of the Garonne, within the old
wall. Our division charged the works at the bridges,
but, in consequence of their strength, were unable to
carry them, and suffered severely in the attempt.

During the 11th, not a shot was fired on either side,
and the French bands were playing the greater part of
the day. Ours were also brought down, and a sort of
conversation was kept up by the different tunes played.
The French would listen attentively while ours played
the âDownfall of Paris,â and in turn gave us a reply of
the same kind. Next morning, to our surprise, we
found them gone. They had retreated during the
night, leaving in our hands three generals and one
thousand six hundred prisoners, with much stores of all
descriptions.

On the evening of the 12th an express arrived from
Paris, to inform Lord Wellington of the peace; Marshal
Soult would not believe it, but he agreed to a cessation
of hostilities. We were now encamped at the outside
of the town, where we remained for a few days. When
advancing about three leagues, we met a messenger on
his way to Toulouse, on a mission from the government,
and it was now that we got full confirmation of the
joyful news. Each heart beat light at the intelligence,
but we could scarcely dare to believe it; we had been
so often deceived, that we thought it too good news to
be true. Nothing, however, was now talked of but
home.

We were quartered in Le Mas, a short distance from
Toulouse, where we remained until the order came for
us to march to Blanchefort, situated in one of the sandy
plains of the Landes. The land was incapable of cultivation,
but they fed numerous flocks of sheep on it, and
[Pg 209]

the shepherds were mounted on huge stilts to enable
them to see for some distance around. The whole army
being collected here, the different individuals who had
formerly been acquainted, had an opportunity of seeing
each other, and our meeting was the happier that we
could now congratulate each other on the return of peace.

In marching from Toulouse to this place, we parted
with the Portuguese army at Condom. They were
then well-regulated and well-disciplined troops. The
English mode of discipline had been introduced among
them for some time, a number of English officers were
attached to them; and acting always in concert with
us, they were now little inferior to ourselves. A kind
of friendship had thus arisen, and caused us to feel
sorry at parting. On the morning that this happened,
they were ranged upon the street, and saluted us as we
passed, and their hearty âVivas!â and exclamations of
regret evinced that they really felt; but a scene of a
more affecting nature took place in the Portuguese and
Spanish women parting with the men of our army, to
whom they had attached themselves during the miserable
state of their country. The generality of them were
not married, but the steady affection and patient endurance
of hardship which they exhibited, in following
those to whom they belonged, would have done credit
to a more legal tie. Being here ordered to return to
their own country with the Portuguese army, and strict
orders given to prevent any of them from proceeding
farther, the scene which ensued was distressing,âthe
poor creatures running about concealing themselves,
in the vain hope of being allowed to remain; but it
was all to no purpose: although they were willing to
have sacrificed country and relations to follow us, the
sacrifice could not be accepted.

From Blanchefort camp we proceeded to Pauilhac,
from whence, in a few days, we embarked in small
vessels, which took us down to the Corduan light-house
where we put on board the San Domingo, 74 gun ship,
and after a pleasant passage arrived at the Cove of
Cork, where we disembarked.

[Pg 210]

Our regiment was nearly nine hundred strong when
we first went out to the Peninsula. During the time
we remained there, we received at various times
recruits to the amount of four hundred, and when we
left the country, our strength was about two hundred
and fifty, out of which number not more than one
hundred and fifty remained who went out with the
regiment.

CONCLUSION.

I have thus endeavoured, as far as my recollection
served me, to give a simple and faithful description
of those scenes in which I was myself an actor, without
partiality to any class. If occasionally I have
drawn an unseemly picture, the fault was in the original,
for I have no personal enmity to any individual in
the service; and I beg it may be distinctly understood,
that many of the abuses which I have narrated are
only spoken of as things that have existed, rather than
as a picture of the present state of the army. Thanks
to his Royal Highness the commander-in-chief, little
is now left the soldier to complain of.

When we look back twenty or thirty years, and
consider what the army was then, and what it is now,
the wonder will be, not that it is not in a better state,
but that so much has been done to ameliorate the
condition of the soldier. Then he was one of the
veriest slaves existing, obliged to rise two or three
hours before day to commence his cleaning operations.
His hair required to be soaped, floured, and frizzed, or
tortured into some uncouth shape which gave him
acute pain, and robbed him of all power of moving his
head unless he brought his body round with it. He
had his musket to burnish, his cap and cartridge-box
to polish with heel-ball, and his white breeches to
pipe-clay, so that it generally required three or four
hours hard labour to prepare him for parade; and
when he turned out, he was like something made of
glass, which the slightest accident might derange or
[Pg 211]

break to pieces. He was then subjected to a rigid
inspection, in which, if a single hair stood out of its
place, extra guard, drill, or some other punishment,
awaited him. When to this was added the supercilious,
tyrannical demeanour of his superiors, who seemed
to look upon him as a brute animal who had neither
soul nor feeling, and who caned or flogged him without
mercy for the slightest offence, we cannot wonder
that he became the debased being, in body and mind,
which they already considered him, or that he possessed
the common vices of a slaveâfawning servility,
duplicity, and want of all self-respect; to add to this,
what was his reward when worn out and unfit for
farther service?âa pittance insufficient to support
nature, or a pass to beg.

When we consider that, in the face of long-established
usages, and coadjutors of unbending and contracted
views of human nature, the commander-in-chief
by his persevering exertions has almost entirely
abolished those numerous vexationsâwhen we see
gentlemanly feeling and attention to the soldierâs best
interests encouraged among the officers of the army,
and the change wrought in the moral and military
character of the soldier by these means,âis it to be
wondered at that every individual in the service is
attached to the Duke of York, and looks up to him in
the light of a father and a friend. Few generals of
whom I have ever either heard or read, enjoyed the
esteem and affection of the troops under their command,
more than His Royal Highness.

The failings alleged against him by his enemies were
severely visited upon him by many, who, had they
examined their own conscience, could not have said
they were innocent of similar errors, and who could not
plead a kindly unsuspecting nature as an excuse. The
country has long consigned to oblivion all remembrance
of them; but they have lately been sacrilegiously
drawn forth by men, whom every well-regulated mind
must blush to call countrymenâmen who have not
only made a jest of his sufferings and probable death,
[Pg 212]

but grinned with fiend-like exultation at the prospect of
a war which was to exterminate, and render miserable
thousands of their fellow-creatures.
[13]

I hate that canting species of liberality which means
free exercise of opinion only to those of the same mode
of thinking, and that deals out unsparing censure on all
those who (no matter how conscientiously) differ from
them; such, however, is the conduct of some of our
special pleaders for religious toleration. In his opposition
to the Catholic claims, who will say that His
Royal Highness did not act conscientiously? And if
this is granted, however firmly he may be attached to
his principles, it is evident he does not adhere to them
with half the violence and pertinacity of those on the
opposite side who raise the cry against him.

His character, however, can never be affected by
vapouring declamationâthe remembrance of his kindness,
benevolence, and accessibility, (if I may use the
term,) will outlive party feeling and animosityâall
classes and sects will yet join in doing justice to the
character of a prince, who, if he possess failings, they
are those common to humanity, while his virtues raise
him much above its ordinary level.

Since the preceding portion of this volume was sent
to press, the melancholy event which was then feared
has taken place, and the narrow tomb now encloses
that heart which, while it continued to beat, embraced
the interests and well-being of thousands. What I
anticipated has already taken placeâall parties join in
eulogizing his worth and virtues. Rancour and fierce
[Pg 213]

hatred have even been disarmed of their venom; but
words can but very inadequately convey the feeling
produced by his death throughout the army. They
now naturally look round with intense anxiety for the
individual who is to succeed him. The Duke of Wellington,
in point of military ability, seems the most
likely; but, judging from the past, I would say, he
will not be to the army what the Duke of York has
been. He may concoct, arrange, and put in practice,
plans for their discipline and equipmentâhe may lead
them to victory, as he has done before; but his name
will never be the key-note to the warm and grateful
feelings of the soldier, when it strikes on his ear, to
send the blood in tingling currents from the heart to
the cheek. Yet I may be mistaken: when the country
at large is progressing rapidly in just sentiment and
liberality of thinking, and enlightened views in the
government of every department are taking the place
of the more severe and austere rules of the old school,
it is doing injustice to the Duke of Wellington, to
believe that he will remain stationary. If he should
assume the command, he will have a glorious opportunity
of treading in the footsteps of his royal predecessor,
and of adding to his great military qualities all
those minor (but not less important) qualifications
which excite menâs gratitude and esteem, and will
enable him to live in the hearts of those under his
command. His claims to the character of a hero will
then be complete, and as such his name will be handed
down to posterity.

FOOTNOTES:

[13]
That such men should possess the confidence of the people of
Ireland, that they should expect any assistance from them, or how
the bombastic declamation and frothy venom, which they spew forth
at public meetings, can have any other effect than to produce disgust,
is to me not a little wonderful. The emancipation of the
Catholics may be retarded, but it will never advance one step under
the direction of men possessed of so much zeal, and so little judgment.

THE EVENTFUL LIFE OF A SOLDIER.

CHAPTER I.

THE RETURN.

The regiment I belonged to had been serving in the
Peninsula from the early part of 1810, during that
harassing and apparently interminable war; for campaign
after campaign succeeded each other, and although
we gained splendid victories in each, we generally
found ourselves taking up our winter quarters on the
same ground from whence we had set out.

At the close of 1812, after a weary and disastrous
retreat from Madrid, we were again quartered in
Portugal; here we remained for five months, during
which the most active and energetic preparations were
made for the ensuing campaign, which commenced in
May, 1813. A series of successes almost unexampled
enabled us to winter in France, and the battle of
Toulouse in April, 1814, concluded a war which had
drained the country of men and treasure. With feelings
which none can know but those who have toiled
through fields of death, we received the order to embark
for Britain, and it was with little regret that we lost
sight of the fair shores of France, âwith its bright
beaming summers exhaling perfume.â Far dearer to
our imaginations were the âhumble broom bowersâ of
our native land, âwhere the blue bell and gowan lurks
lowly unseen.â On the voyage homeward, hope smiled
triumphant, dreams of joy and bliss took the place of
disappointment and despair. Yet often in sleep did
my imagination return to those fields of strife and rapine
that we had left; the agony of disappointed hope again
shed its chilling mildew on my soul, and I awoke expecting
to hear the sound of the bugle or the roar of
[Pg 215]

artillery; but the picture was reversedââsorrow did
not now return with the dawning of morn.â

Our voyage homeward was short and pleasant.
Ireland was our destination, and having anchored in
the Cove of Cork, we proceeded to disembark in lighters.

âYou are welcome to old Ireland,â exclaimed my
comrade Dennis, holding out his hand to me as I
stepped from the boat out of which he had sprung an
instant before, âwelcome to the land of potatoes and
buttermilk. Didnât I tell you that we would live to
see this day? May I never die if this isnât the happiest,
minute of my life! my heartâs so light that I think I
could jump over the moon. Come along, my gay
fellow, we have been long together, âand in spite of
wind and weather we will moisten well our clayââI
mean by and by, when we get to our billets. Did
you ever drink any potheen, Joseph? Och! there
never was drink like it in the universe, for if you wish
to be in any mood at all, itâll do the job for ye. If you
want to fight, potheen will make you face the ould boy
himself; if you have any notion of making love, with
a bumper or two of Inishone you might malvader the
heart of Diana; and if crying is your game, it will
make your heart as soft as prapeen. Go to the first
wake you can in this country, and youâll see what
wonders it works; it will do your heart good to see
how it makes the tears trickle down their cheeks, and
sets them a counting their pedigree back to the time
when Adam was a little boy; ay, indeed, (but I must
whisper it,) I have seen it make a voteen of many an
old woman that said her Paternave dry enough at any
other time. Och, pure potheenâs the liquor for me,âit
beats brandy, rum, and gin, out of all razon.â

Whatever I might think of the extravagant praise
which Dennis had bestowed on his favourite whisky, I
certainly participated in his joyous feelings, and felt an
affection at that moment for every thing living, from the
half naked urchins that ran about the cabin doors, down
to the pigs, cocks, and hens, that participated in their
sports, food, and lodging.

[Pg 216]

We were billeted that day in Cork, on a respectable
tradesman,âa kind, cheerful fellow, who exerted
himself to make us comfortable; and after a dinner
such as we had been long strangers to, he insisted upon
us joining him in a tumbler of punch.

âCome, my dear,â said the landlord to his wife, who
was present, âbe kind enough to sing us a song.â

âWith all my heart,â said she, and she began the
well-known song of âErin-go-bragh.â The air is uncommonly
plaintive and beautiful, but few who have
not heard it can conceive the expression and pathos
which an enthusiastic Irishwoman can throw into it.
Such was our hostess, and she poured out her strains
in a voice so delightfully sweet that my heart thrilled
to its core: no doubt association and the state of our
minds aided the effect, but I never felt so much pleasure
from music. Recollections of former scenes and feelings
crowded on my memory, and my eyes filled with tears.
Dennis sat entranced in his chair trying to swallow the
emotion that he was ashamed to show, while his eye was
fixed on the singer as if on some heavenly vision. She
had herself caught the infection, and as she repeated

âAh! where is the mother that watchâd oâer my childhood?â

her voice faltered, and the tear trembled in her eye.
Dennis could contain himself no longer; he covered
his face with his hands and wept aloud; a pause ensued,
but it was a pause occasioned by revealings of the
soul, too purely intellectual for expression.

Silence was broken by our hostess.

âPoor fellows!â said she, âI see the dreadful scenes
you have witnessed have not hardened your hearts:
they still beat true to nature.â

âOh,â said Dennis, âthereâs more in that song than
you have any notion of; manyâs the time I sung it
when I was far from home, and, when I little expected
to see old Ireland or my poor mother againâsurely
it was an Irishman that made that song.â

âHe has all the warm feeling of one,â said I, âbut I
believe he is a townsman of mine, Dennis.â

[Pg 217]

âNever mind,â replied he, âhis heart is an Irish oneâand
thatâs the best part of him.â

From the various circumstances connected with it,
I am sure I never spent a happier evening, and next
morning we parted with our kind hosts with as much
regret as if we had known each other for years.

From Cork the regiment marched to Fermoy; having
been on duty, which detained me some hours after the
corps, I set out alone to perform the journey. When
half way, I overtook a countryman travelling the same
road, with whom I entered into conversation. We had
not gone far together when my attention was attracted
by a wild cry, which seemed to be borne on the wind
from some distance; it burst on my ear like the cry of
a person in distressâthen, gradually sinking to a low
moan, it ceased for a few moments, when again the
despairing shriek swelled to the utmost pitch of the
human voice,âagain it sank to the plaintive murmur,
and melted into air. There was something uncouth in
the notes, but they were expressively wild and melancholy,
and I felt myself powerfully affected without being
able to account for it. I stopped for a moment to listen,
and asked my companion the meaning of what I heard.

âOh, itâs some poor creature going to his long home,â
said he, âthat they are keening over.â

We had not gone far, when at a turning of the road,
the melancholy procession opened on our view,âa
countryman driving a car, on which was placed a coffin.
One solitary mourner, (an old woman,) clung to it
with one hand, while the other was raised in a despairing
attitude; her gray hair hung in dishevelled tresses
about her face and shoulders, and intense grief was
depicted in her haggard countenance. My companion
requested me to wait a moment, while he turned back
a short way with the corpse. âWell,â said he to me
when he returned, âmanyâs the funeral I have seen;
but never one like that,ââthey havenât a single neighbour
with them: when the poorest creature would
have half the parish, but that comes of the boyâs own
behaviourâGod be merciful to his soul!â

[Pg 218]

âWhy, what harm did he do?â

âSo much that I believe his poor father and mother
will never be able to hold up their heads again: he was
the means of bringing two of his own relations to the
gallows, that but for him might have been alive and
well to-day; they were all three laid up for taking
arms from a gentlemanâs house near this, and there
was no clear proof against them, but they wheedled
over this boy thatâs dead now, to turn kingâs evidence,
and save his own life; but he never did a
dayâs good after, and he died the other day of fever,
and not one of his neighbours would attend his wakeâGod
help his poor people!â

On reaching Fermoy, I found the regiment in barracks,
where we remained only a few days, when we
received the route to march to Wexford, a town on the
west coast of Ireland. On reaching a village that lay
in our route, the place being small, and the inhabitants
poor, we were but indifferently supplied with billets.
Poor Dennis had been rather unwell for a day or two
previous, and I hastened to find out our quarters, that
we might have an opportunity of lying down. Having
inquired for the person we were billeted on, we were
directed to a low-roofed cabin, where a tall, masculine-looking
old woman was standing in the door-way.

âCome away, honies,â said she, with an arch mischievous
expression of countenance, âyou are welcome,
I was just waiting for yees.â

âThank you,â said I, stooping down to enter the
cabin, which was so filled with smoke that I could see
nothing of the interior. By the help of the crone,
however, we got ourselves seated by the fire, which was
made in the centre of the apartment, the door of which
served for chimney, window, and all.

Dennis feeling himself very sick, expressed a wish to
lie down, and I asked the landlady to show him our
bed, for although I saw none, I thought she might
have some other apartment.

âThat I will, Iâll be after making a fahl for the poor
boy in a minute. Get up out oâ that,â said she, angrily,
[Pg 219]

to some one who lay on a bundle of straw, in a dark
corner of the room, enveloped in something resembling
an old great coat.

âO donât disturb any body for us.â

âTroth and itâs myself that will,â and seized a stick
that was lying by the fire to chastise the object she had
addressed.

Seeing the miserable appearance of the hovel, I had
made up my mind to seek other quarters, and was
proceeding to remonstrate, but before I could, the old
woman had inflicted the blow; a grunt followed, and
presently an enormous pig, carrying the half of the
straw, and the ragged coat on his back, came running
towards the door, and in his struggle to pass me, threw
me over. Ill as Dennis was, he could not help
laughing, and the old woman, instead of condoling
with me on my misfortune, exclaimed, âWhat a
smashing sodger you are, to let the pigs knock you
down.â

âCome away, Dennis,â said I, âif this is a specimen
of your country, you have much reason to be proud
of it.â

âOch! is that the way you are going to leave me?â
said the old hag, when she saw us moving off.

âTroth is it,â replied Dennis, âfor I would be sorry
to disturb any of the decent family.â

We luckily procured a lodging in a public-house near
the cabin, and having mentioned our reason for changing
our quartersâ

âJudy is too many for ye,â said our host; âsheâs no
friend to the sodgers any how: she lost two brave boys
in the rebellion, and was a right rebel herself. I have
seen the day when she would have thought no more of
knocking down a man than of eating her breakfast.
Itâs not many years since, when we had a fair here, the
boys were seemingly going to disperse without a bit of
a
row
, and bad luck to me if she didnât take off her jock,
and holding it by the one sleeve, trailed it through
the fair, crying out to her own party, that the blood of the
OâBriens had turned into buttermilk, or they would
[Pg 220]

never let the faction of the Murphies home, without a
blow being struck. âCome, you chicken-hearted rogues?â
said she, while she brandished a stick in her hand, âlet
me see the thiefâs breed of a Murphy that will dare to
put his foot on my jock.â The boys only laughed at
first, but some one in the crowd, out of contempt, threw
a dead rat which struck her on the face; this enraged
her so, that she knocked down the man nearest her,
and in a twinkling there was a fight that beat anything
ever was seen, and she was there to the last. But the
devil himselfâs but a fool to ould Judy.â

CHAPTER II.

PARTY SPIRIT.

We arrived at Wexford, the station allotted for our
regiment. It had been for some time the head quarters
of the rebel army during the disturbances of 1798, and
the scenes said to have been acted in and near it during
that unfortunate period, being impressed on our
minds, we entered the place with strong prejudices
against the inhabitants. From a people implicated in
what was termed a foul, unnatural rebellion, against a
mild and equitable government, what could soldiers
expect but treachery and fixed enmity? How were
we deceived when we found them the most urbane,
good-humoured people we had ever been amongst. This
is remarkable, thought I: surely it must have been some
strange infatuation, or some galling wrong that goaded
these people into rebellion; and when we had been a
short time there, I sought a solution of the enigma from
a person with whom I had become acquainted, from
being billeted in his house, when we first came into the
town.

âIn the first place,â said he, âI need not tell you
what every body knows, that it was only the Catholics
that rebelled. You wonder at them not showing their
rebellious spirit: now,â said he, âdo you know the
[Pg 221]

reason? they durstnât. When they had the power,
they showed us poor Protestants what they could do.
Did you never read or hear of the burning of Scullabogue,
the piking on the wooden bridge there beyond,
and all the bloody cruelties they committed in every
part of Ireland?â

âI have,â replied I, âand that is the very reason
I am surprised at the peaceable temper they now
display.â

âIt was driven into them by the lash and the gibbet,â
said he; but if they durst put out their horns, you
would soon see them at their old tricks; devil a Protestant
but they would pike and throw into the Slaney.
Do you think that we could live in safety here an hour,
if it was not for the military? God help ye! you think
because they put on a smooth face to ye, now when
they canât better themselves, that they are every thing
thatâs good; but you may take my word for it that
every motherâs son of them are perfect Judasâs, and
when they look smiling in your face they are wishing
for an opportunity to cut your throat. Och, man! does
not their priests tell them that they are to keep no faith
with heretics?âThey talk about emancipating themâby
my soul! I would as soon emancipate a roaring
lion; if ever that takes place, the reign of bloody Mary
would be nothing to what would follow: you would
soon see the Pope over here with his inquisition, and
not one Protestant they would leave in the country in
six months. I hope I will never live to see the day
when the Papists will be put on a footing with us:
nothing will ever save the poor Protestants but to keep
the hold while they have it, and resist the Pope, the
Papists, and the devil, up to the knees in blood, as
every true orangeman is in duty bound. You should
join our orange club, manâsure, two of your officers
have joined us.â

I was carried away with this declamation, which he
accompanied with violent and emphatic gesture, and
really began to think the Catholics the guilty beings
that he represented them; still I could not but consider
[Pg 222]

them miserably situated, when they were alike distrusted
and reviledâin arms against the government,
or living as peaceable subjects. On more mature
deliberation, I did not feel satisfied with the round
assertions he had made, and I sought opportunities of
mixing with people of the Catholic persuasion. I am
sorry to say that those whom my rank in life enabled
me to mix with, did not give me very favourable opportunities
of judging; they seemed to feel the same
rancour against the Protestants, which my friend had
evinced against them, without being able to give a
very satisfactory reason for it. They had an idea that
the Protestants were insolent tyrants, that the Catholics
were oppressed and injured by them, and therefore had
a right to hate their oppressors.

Some time after this, I became acquainted with a
very intelligent Catholic, and anxious to hear what
he could say in answer to the assertions of my protestant
friend, I several times attempted to lead our conversation
to that point, but he seemed to feel averse from the
subject.

âRemember,â said he to me one day, âthat it is
rather a dangerous thing to express our political opinions
in this country. I might,â said he, in a half joking
manner, âget heated on the subject, and spout treason;
and who knows but you might lodge informations
against me, that would get me exhibited in front of
the gaol, as an example to my deluded countrymen,
or sent to cool my heels in New South Wales.
You laugh, but the time is scarcely yet gone by, when
your report of my disaffection to the government would
have got me elevated to the first lamp post, without
either judge or jury. But to show you I place some
confidence in you, I will put my neck in your power
by repeating my opinion on the subject. Believe me,
whatever your friend may have said to the contrary,
that the rancour and hatred of Protestants and Catholics,
so apparent in this country, does not lie so much in the
difference of their creed, as in prejudices artfully
engendered and kept alive by political and religious
[Pg 223]

intrigue, aided no doubt by the ignorance of the people
themselves. You are a young man, a native of a
happier kingdom, and of a different persuasion, and
cannot, therefore enter into the feelings of this oppressed
and insulted nation; nor can those who have not felt
the legalized tyranny which is practised on us form any
idea of what this miserable country has suffered.
Victims to political corruption on the one hand, and
religious rapacity and bigotry on the other; by the one
we are deprived of our rights as men and subjects, and
by the other robbed of our means of subsistence, to
support in luxury and idleness a church establishment
of which we are not members, the clergymen of which
in their own persons exercise the office of priest and
judge, to whom, if we consider ourselves aggrieved by
their extortions, we are obliged to appeal for redress;
but this is nothing to the continual dropping torment
which we are doomed to endure from our subordinate
oppressors, who are to a man what are termed
Protestants,âtithe proctors, excisemen, constables,
pound keepers, all are Protestants, and contrive at
every step to put us in mind of our political bondage;
and when we are goaded on by our merciless drivers
until we grow frantic, they term the writhings of
tortured and insulted nature, rebellion.

âThe rebellion which rendered this county notorious,
has been called a rebellion of the Catholics. It is
false; it was first begun in the north of Ireland by
ProtestantsâPresbyterians if you will. A grand
political scheme was then in agitation,âthe withdrawing
the semblance of a government from this country.
Great opposition was expected. This rebellion,
properly managed, would afford a pretext for the
measure, and prepare the way for the important change.
The conspiracy might have been crushed at the outset;
but instead of that, it was allowed to spread its
ramifications through the whole island. This it did
more rapidly than was at first imagined, and as Samson
of old, when deprived of his eyesight, and brought out
to make sport for the lords of the Philistines, made a
[Pg 224]

dreadful end of their amusement, our rulers ran some
danger of being involved in the commotion which
ensued.

âDivide to govern,â seems to have been the
Machiavelian policy by which this unhappy country has
been always ruled. As the only measure to save
themselves was to create distrust between those
implicated, the Catholics were stigmatized as the
movers of the rebellion, and their end to overturn the
Protestant religion. This had the desired effect: the
Protestants, for their secession from the cause, were
invested with the office of hunting us down,âhow they
performed their task, is in this country too well known.
As those who commit wrong are more implacable and
unforgiving than those injured, the Protestants have
ever since nourished a deadly hatred towards us, and
knowing the tenure on which they hold their power,
dread that we should ever be placed on a par with them.

Would your countrymen suffer what we have
done without trying to shake themselves free of the
yoke?âno, they would not. When an attempt was
made to saddle Episcopacy upon them, to a man
they resisted the attempt; and the consequence was,
that, like us, they were hunted as wild beasts, their
houses were burned, their property robbed, their
women violated, and themselves brought to the torture
and the gibbet. They bore it all, animated by a
determined spirit, and, aided by good fortune, they
triumphed; and now in possession of dear-earned
privileges, you look back with pride and exultation on
what they achieved. But what is in you esteemed a
virtue, is with us a crime. Poor Ireland has not been
so fortunate; her efforts to assert her birthright,
through the want of unanimity amongst her children,
have been unsuccessful, and are still stigmatized as
rebellion, while yours are lauded to the skies. Remember,
I do not attempt to vindicate the insurrection of
that period, which was at best but an insane project,
and even had it succeeded, would have produced no
permanent advantage to this country.

[Pg 225]

âAbove all other people, you ought to feel most
sympathy for us; but if I mistake not, the measure of
our emancipation meets with more virulent opposition
in Scotland than in any other place. I repeat it again,
that our creeds do not cause the deadly hatred which
exists between the Catholic and Protestant in Ireland.
See how peaceably they live together in England and
Scotland, where they do not feel the irritation which
excites us here. Nothing will ever restore our unhappy
country to a state of quiet, but removing the disgraceful
bonds with which we are weighed down to the
earth. An enthusiasm pervades the country to emancipate
the West Indian negroes; let them first remove
the taint from their own constitution, let them eradicate
the plague-spot from themselves, and then, with a clear
conscience, they may go on and prosper; until then,
their exertions in that cause will appear hypocritical
and absurdâBut I am talking to you as if you were
interested in the matter. I forget that soldiers have
nothing to do with politics, and far less soldiers who
are here to keep the peace among the wild Irish.â

The conflicting statements here given may serve to
give a tolerably correct idea of the state of party feeling
in Ireland; at present I refrain from making any
observations of my own on the subject.

CHAPTER III.

ARREARS.

When we had been a few weeks in Wexford, we
received about six monthsâ pay, of which we had fallen
in arrear while in the Peninsula, amounting to a considerable
sum each man; and as it could scarcely be
spent by individuals like us, who had been exiled from
home and all its enjoyments for a number of years,
without some spreeing, the commanding-officer wisely
resolved to relax the reins of discipline a little. In
such cases I have always found that severe restraint
[Pg 226]

creates the evil that it is meant to prevent; but when
humoured in some degree, the ebullition passes over,âfoolishly
enough certainly, but in general harmlessly.
Nothing is more natural than that menâs judgment
should be carried away by their animal spirits on such
occasions, and those who purse up their mouths and
treat the matter as a crime, know nothing at all about it.

Our poor fellows, when they got their money, in the
joy of their hearts, played such fooleries as could
challenge comparison with any shipâs crew that ever
came into port. It would be an endless task to portray
every extravagance they ran into; all joined, however,
in a greater or less degree, in paying their addresses
to the whisky; each heart then became unveiled, and
a very common observer could have told the ruling
passion of each individual in the regiment. Some
showed their devotion to the fair sex, by hauling
in every female with whom they had the slightest
acquaintance, and treating them to gowns, caps, or
anything they chose to ask. Others gratified their
ambitious longings by hiring horses, coaches, gigs, or
jaunting cars, and riding into the country or about the
town. Dennis and I were in the throng, no doubt,
and on receiving our cash sallied forth in quest of
adventures. Dennis could not brook the idea of entering
a common public-house on that day. âWe have
not long to act the gentleman,â said he, âwe may as
well make a good use of our time;â so saying, he led
the way to the head inn, and with the utmost pomp
bawled out âwaiter!ââThe waiter made his appearance.ââBring
us a bottle of wine.ââThe waiter smiled,
and looked as if he thought him mad.ââGo along, sir,
and do as I order you,â said Dennis; âyou stare, you
spalpeen, as if you never saw a gentleman before.â The
waiter made his escape, and having consulted with his
master, brought the wine. We had scarcely seated
ourselves when two of our officers entered,âthe one
was a good fellow, generous, brave, and feeling; the
other was the reverse. âMr G.,â said Dennis, addressing
the former, âwill you be kind enough to drink with us?â

[Pg 227]

âCertainly, my good fellow, it is not the first time
you and I have drank together; I do not forget the
time you gave me the last drop out of your canteen,
on that long dayâs march going up through Spain, when
every one was dying with thirst, and no water to be
had.â

Having drank to our health, and the glasses replenished,
Dennis took up one,ââLong life to you, Mr
G., you are a noble, brave officer, and I could shed my
heartâs blood for you by night or by day; I wish I
could say as much for many a one in the corps,â casting
a significant look at the other officer.

I whispered to Dennis, âYou had better ask him to
drink.â

âDevil a sup,â said he, loud enough to be heard.
Mr J. felt galled to the soul, and colouring with rage
he walked out of the room, accompanied by the other
officer, who seemed to take no notice of what Dennis
had said.

âYou were too rude,â said I; âyou provoke the man
to be your enemy.â

âIs it my enemyâsure he is every bodyâs enemy,
and anything that Dennis could say or do, would not
change him for better or worse. Donât you remember
the death of poor Hâbâsân, how could any body
like him after that? I wouldnât have his conscience
for worlds.
[14]
But come, comrade, letâs into the cityâBy
[Pg 228]

the powers, I had almost forgot myself, I promised
to call on Peggy Doyle. Let me see, what will I buy
for Peggy?ââbut that moment a carriage came rattling
down the street, filled outside and inside with our
comrades, and ribbons and handkerchiefs streaming
from all parts of it. âBy the hokey!â cried Dennis,
in a yell of transport, âletâs scale the garrison.â In a
moment we were mounted, and poor Peggy Doyle was
consigned to oblivion.

The town was now in an uproar; carriages, sociables,
and jaunting cars were in requisition, flying past
in every direction, with our men clinging to the outside
of them, to the manifest danger of their necks and
limbs. Every thing seemed to have received an impulse
unusual to it, and participated in the flying motion,âthe
old women shouted, the children capered, the dogs
barked, and the very pigs, instead of lying lazily before
the doors, were galloping about the streets with their
tails cocked.

Some of the boys had tarried so long at the whisky,
that all the vehicles of any speed had been taken up;
but their invention was soon at work; common cars
were hired by them, and driven furiously along, to the
great torment of the poor hacks. One fellow, who had
been too late for even a common car, and determined
at all events to ride, jumped into an empty buttermilk
churn
[15]
up to the neck, and paid the woman handsomely
to drive him along. âOch, itâs yourself that has the
taste, Slobber-daddy,â cried Dennis, âyou were always
fond of the slurry.â
[16]
He had scarcely spoke the word,
[Pg 229]

when the wheel of the carriage came in contact with that
of the car, and in a twinkling we were all sprawling in
the mud, in glorious confusion. Nobody was hurt, however,
the buttermilk hero excepted, who had broken his
nose when emptied out of the churn. Up we were
again in a moment, dashing along, regardless of old
women, children, and corners, until the poor horses
were so jaded that they actually stood still. It was
now near evening, all the public-houses soon filled,
and drinking and boisterous mirth of every description
was kept up during the night.

Next day the same scenes were renewed, the same
wanton prodigality in spending the money which had
been so dearly earned. On this day Dennis was
determined that his sweetheart should not be forgotten;
but it may be as well to exonerate him from falling in
love too hastily, by stating that Peggy and he had
been acquainted when children, and were distantly
related to each other. She had removed to this place
along with her mistress, during the time Dennis was
abroad. They had accidentally metâtheir joy on
meeting was as great as it was unexpected, and a kind
of courtship had been kept up between them from that
time. A gown-piece and a handsome shawl were now
bought for her, and Dennis having delivered it, we
were going farther into the town, when we met John ââ,
a particular friend of ours, though not in the
same company, whom we had not seen since the commencement
of the riot.

âWhere on earth have you been, John?â said I; âwe
have been hunting every place for you, and you were
not to be found. Whatâs the matter with you, man?
you look very demure; why donât you join in the
general joy? come along into the town.â

âI hope you will excuse me,â replied he, âI cannot go
now.â

We insisted on knowing his reason; he tried to
evade giving any, but at length he said, âhe had no
money.â

âO, what consequence is that?â said Dennis, âwe
[Pg 230]

have some. But what has become of your back pay,
have you lost it?â

âNo.â

âAnd what the deuce have you done with it?â

John blushed and hesitated a moment, âI have sent
it to my mother.â

âWhatâall? without keeping anything to drink?â

âYes,â said he, âI durst not trust myself to send it if
I once began, and in my sober senses I thought it a pity
to spend a shilling uselessly of that which would do her
so much good.â

âLong life to you, Jack!â said Dennis, shaking him
by the hand, âyouâre a noble boy; but come along with
us, you are not going home to mope in the barracks,
and nobody there but yourself; you shall share with
us while we have anything.â

âNo,â replied John, firmly, âthat I cannot do; I
thought on all these things before I sent the money; I
know I shall be lonely enough while these times last,
but I will never drink at any other personâs expense, in
such circumstances. No, no, the first letter I get from
my poor mother, after she receives the money, will
repay me for all I have done, a thousand times.â

We parted from him with reluctance, but we knew
it was of no use to press him farther. Dennis and I
adjourned to a public-house, where, having got a room
to ourselves, he called for a sheet of paper and pen
and ink.

âWhat do you want with the paper?â said I.

âI wish you to write a bit of a letter for me. Do
you know, that when John was telling us about
sending the money, I could have cried, so I could, to
think that the whisky or the noise should put my old
mother out of my head; and I owe John my blessing
for putting me in mind of her. Now, thereâs nothing
like striking the iron while itâs hot; so just write me a
bit of a line. Iâll sendâlet me see, (dividing the notes
from the silver,) Iâll send the bits of paper, and keep
the tenpennies, and much good may it do to the poor
old creature.â

[Pg 231]

I wrote the letter accordingly, and having enclosed
the money, Dennis got up to go to the post office.

âWill you not drink before you go?â

âNo, indeed, it wouldnât go down.â He was off and
returning in a few minutes,â

âHand us the glass, now,â said he, âfor my throatâs
clear, and my heartâs light.â

Many of the lads were now beginning to feel the
bottom of their purse, and put on a sober face, but few
of them, I believe, derived so much pleasure from a
review of the manner in which they had spent their
money as did my friends John and Dennis.

By the end of a week things were restored to their
usual routine; but the kindly feeling generated between
us and the inhabitants did not so soon cease, for
during the many months we remained there, we were
on the very best terms with them.

FOOTNOTES:

[14]
The story Dennis alluded to was certainly a dreadful one. Poor
H. joined us a short time before we advanced through Spain, and
being but a weakly boy, when we commenced the march, he was
unable to keep up with the regiment. He reported himself sick, but
the doctor finding that he complained of nothing but weakness,
accused him of scheming, and scratched his name out of the report;
this did not give him more strength, and he fell out the next dayâs
march. The officer of whom Dennis had expressed his dislike, being
riding in the rear of the regiment, swore at him dreadfully, and
threatened to turn him over to the provost and have him flogged if
he would not keep up, but his threatenings were of no avail. Next
day he was again reported sick, again accused of scheming, and sent
to march with his company, and, as on the preceding day, was
unable to keep pace with his comrades. He was given in charge to
the rear guard, and Mr J. ordered two men of the guard to drag
him along, and another to go behind him and prick him on with
his bayonet; but all this cruelty was unavailingâthey were obliged
to give up dragging him, and leave him behind. During this time
he had never complained, but his heart was broken. When he was
left he crawled off the road into a field, and, tired of a world in which
he had met with such cruel treatment, loaded his musket, and
taking off his stocking, put his toe on the trigger, and blew out his
brains.

CHAPTER IV.

COLONEL LLOYD.

About three months after our arrival, we were sitting
by the barrack-room fire one night, talking of our campaigns,
a subject which was deeply interesting to us all.

âHere we are,â said Dennis, âround a good fire in
the heart of Paddyâs land; last year at this time we
were lying on the Pyrenees, starving alive, with the tents
blowing down about our ears. But we had then what
would make us forget every thing elseâwe had Colonel
Lloyd commanding usâGod rest his soul! he was too
good to live long. Do you think his friends will not
bring home his remains? Upon my soul, if I had the
means, if I would not travel every foot to the heights
of Zara, and bring them to Ireland; I am sure he
would rest easier in his own native place.â

âWhy are you so anxious about his body,â said
I, âwhen your creed forbids you to believe his soul safeâColonel
Lloyd was a heretic, you know.â

[Pg 232]

âOch, bother!â said Dennis, âall the priests in
Christendom would not make me believe that. Troth,
if he isnât in heaven, deuce a one of themselves are
there; and if I thought he would not get there because
he was a Protestant, I would deny my religion for ever.â

My comrades continued to talk of his goodness, for
it was a theme they never tired of, but I was abstracted.
To-morrow, thought I, it is just a twelvemonth since
he closed his gallant career. Never will I forget that
day. We turned out about two oâclock in the morning
to storm the French intrenchments; as was his usual
custom, he was on the ground before the regiment
formed, mounted on his gray horse, which had carried
him in many engagements. On reaching the foot of
the hill on which we were encamped, we halted and
waited the signal gun to advance. Daylight had
broke, and the eastern clouds were tinged with that
glorious colour which no painter can copy or no tongue
describe. The French were in our view, and, âlike
greyhounds on the slip,â we were waiting the signal to
begin the fight, with that fearful anxiety which is more
intolerable to bear than the greatest danger, and to
which action is relief. Colonel Lloyd was at our
head, with his face turned towards us, lighted up with
its usual benignity and confidence. He looked on us
as if he had said, I see you are all devoted to me; and
the high resolutions he was forming on this conviction
could be seen working in his countenance; his eye
was âwildly spiritually bright,â and the reflection of the
gorgeous sky beaming on his fine features, gave them
an expression almost superhuman. I am sure there
was not a man in the regiment who could not have
died for him, or with him, at that moment. A few
minutes after, and the battle raged from right to left of
the British line. His bravery exceeded all encomium,
but it was the âlast of his fields;â he met his death-shot
in ascending to the attack of a redoubt in the last line
of entrenchments. He lived only a few minutes, and
the only words he uttered were,ââI am dying, I am
dying, I am dying!ââbut his feelings might, with
[Pg 233]

truth, have been portrayed thus:ââI perish in the
noon of my fame; I have bought honour and distinction
with my blood, but when they are within my
grasp, death, with his cold hand, intercepts them, and
cuts me off from the world for ever. âO Glory! thou
art an unreal good.ââ Mingled with these reflections
came, no doubt, thoughts of kindred and friends, whose
face he was doomed never to behold; but the scene
soon closed, and all that remained of the young and
gifted Lloyd, was the inanimate mould which had
enshrined a soul as generous and brave âas eâer burst
its mortal control.â

My praise of Colonel Lloyd may appear, to some,
hyperbolical; but I have no end to serveâhe is himself
gone, and his relations, if he have any living, I
know nothing about. In giving vent to my feelings in
portraying his character, I am sensible I only give a
faithful transcript of those of my comrades who then
composed the corps, and whose devotion to his memory
proves how susceptible soldiers are of feelings of love
and gratitude to those who treat them as they ought to
be treatedâwith kindness.

Furloughs were now granting to a certain number
of men to go home to see their friends. Dennis, on
the faith of some former promise, got one, but I was
not so fortunate. He was quite delighted at the idea
of going to see his mother and relations, and the evening
previous to his intended departure he was very
busy packing up his things.

âNow,â said he, when he had finished, âI will start
very early to-morrow morning, and I think I will be
able to manage the journey in four days.â

âHereâs some one asking for Dennis,â said a comrade.

An old woman, habited in a gray cloak, with a
handkerchief on her head tied under her chin, entered
the room, and looked round inquiringly at each face,
until she found the one which was too deeply imprinted
on her memory ever to forget. Then, springing
forward, she caught Dennis in her arms, and almost
smothered him with kisses.

[Pg 234]

âOch, my poor child!â said she, âdo I live to see
you once more? Jewel and darling! but this is a
blessed day for your poor mother.â

Dennis was perfectly bewilderedâso much taken
by surprise that he could not utter a word for some
minutes; at length he saidâ

âIn the name of God, mother, what brought you
here?â

âIndeed, I just came to see yourself astore; and
wasnât that reason good enough? and I would have
come for that same, if it had been twice as far, although
I walked every foot of the road.â

âWell, well,â said Dennis, âthat beats Banacher and
Balinasloe! Havenât I my knapsack packed to set off
home to-morrow? and here you have made all this
journey for nothing, dragging the old limbs of ye.â

âWhat matter, child? canât we go home together?
weâll be company on the road.â

They actually set off in a day or two after, taking
the first stage by the coach. The poor old woman,
although between sixty and seventy years of age,
had travelled upwards of a hundred miles on foot to see
her son.

Soon after this, several parties going to Scotland
on the recruiting service, I had an offer, if I chose, to
go on that duty; but I refused it, as did many others
to whom the offer was made. Few soldiers like it,
being associated in their minds with something mean
and dishonest; and the fact that those men who possess
laxity of principle, and are but otherwise indifferent
soldiers, are generally the most successful on that duty,
strengthens the idea; and it is well known that men
so employed, whatever might have been their previous
character, return to their regiment much worse soldiers
than when they left it. It is too often the practice of
those so employed, to consider all stratagem fair, and
so that they enlist men for the service, they care little
whether the means taken are legal or not. Many, I
know, argue, that when men are wanted, we should
not be too fastidious in the means used to procure
[Pg 235]

them; and they quote the impressment of seamen,âthat
stain in our constitution, which our strenuous
efforts to emancipate the West Indian negroes renders
deeper and deeper. But one bad action can never be
vindicated by another; and I cannot see how any
cause can be really benefited by duplicity and cunning;
on the contrary, it must hurt it, for it raises suspicion
where there is no real grounds for any. I am sure it
would facilitate the recruiting of the army, to give up
all undue means to entrap men by plying them with
drink, or telling them lies. I am persuaded that there
are thousands to whom a military life would be far
preferable to what they are employed atâmany of whom
would enlist, were it not that a suspicion is excited in
their minds, that all is not right, by the finessing and
over-anxiety displayed by those employed on the
recruiting service. The liberal feeling and good sense
which pervades the majority of the officers in the army
at present, have rendered the situation of a soldier now
quite another thing to what it was when I first entered
it. This has been brought about by the increasing
intelligence of the nation, but also in a great degree by
the disposition evinced by the commander-in-chief.
âOne tyrant makes manyââof the reverse of this we
have a bright example in His Royal Highness the Duke
of York. He is in truth the
SOLDIERâS FRIEND
, and
the whole army look up to him with confidence. I
can have no aim in flattering him: if he did not deserve
this encomium, he would not get it from me.

CHAPTER V.

MY NATIVE LAND.

I had received several letters from my parents since
my return; they were both well, and urged me to
procure a furlough and go home to see them. It was
some time before I could accomplish this; but at length
it was effected, and having taken a seat on the coach,
I set off on my journey home. On reaching Dublin I
[Pg 236]

luckily found a vessel prepared to sail for Irvine, and
securing a passage, I embarked next morning. The
wind being favourable, we set sail, and were soon fairly
in the Channel, holding on our course; the breeze
continued steady all that day, and by night we had run
a long way down the coast.

Feeling little inclination to sleep, about midnight I
came on deck. Considering the season of the year, it
was a delightful night: the moon shed her silver
radiance oâer reposing nature, like the smile of a fond
mother over her sleeping infant, and as I gazed on
her, sailing through the blue expanse of heaven, with
her attendant train of myriads of sparkling orbs, I
felt my mind soar beyond this earth and all its
concerns.

Who ever gazed upon them shining,

And turned to earth without repining,

Nor wished for wings to fly away,

And mix in their eternal ray.

While I leaned over the shipâs bow, watching the
moonbeams dancing on the glassy bosom of the deepâmy
ear soothed with the rippling of the vessel, as she
urged her way through the waters,âI felt as if shut
out from the world, and emancipated from its laws and
control. At sea is the place for reflection and contemplationâthere
the memory, as if secure in her privacy,
unlocks and draws forth her secret treasures, and broods
over them with miser care.

Before me the softened outline of the distant coast of
Scotland could be seen, its rugged points bursting
through the gauzy film with which they were enveloped;
but the well known rock of Ailsa stood forth in bold
relief, its giant mass towering proudly above the waves,
alike defying their fury and the hand of time. The
sight of that rock, which the emigrant associates with
the farewell to his country, called forth in my bosom a
tide of recollections. When I last saw it, I was
returning as now, from one of my wild adventures in
search of happiness and fame; the result of both were
nearly equalâmisery and disappointment; the last,
[Pg 237]

however, had been the most severe lesson, and I was
now, like the prodigal son, retracing my way from a
far country, where I had been glad, literally, to feed
on the husks which formed the food of the swine. My
past life glided in review before my mind, and I could
not help exclaiming, What a fool have I been? I have
bartered every privilege which was my birthright, in
the pursuit of wild and vain dreams of renown and
happiness. Setting aside the misery and hardship I
have endured, has not the last six years of my life been
a blank? That period of time employed in my education
at home, what might I not have been? but my
doom is fixed, I have sealed it myselfâthere was
distraction in the thought.

That day I landed at Irvine, and resolved to pursue
my journey homeward without stopping. As I travelled
along, I felt that tumultuous fluttering and overflowing
of the heart, and buoyancy of tread, which every
sensitive being must have felt on re-visiting the land of
his birth, after years of separation from all that was
dear to him. The sun was setting when I reached the
wood of Curcarth. It had been the haunt of many of
my childish wanderings; there I had often roved,
unconscious of where I was going. My soul, awed
with the deep shade that the trees cast around, I trod
as if on holy ground, while the ceaseless hum of its
insect inhabitants, mingled with the wail of the cushat,
cherished the deep pensive feeling which the scene had
excited in my bosom. It was here that I first learned
to commune with my own heart, and my imagination
first soared into the realms of faÃ«ry. Near its margin
was the stream, on whose banks I have lain listening
to its murmuring, my gaze fixed on the world, portrayed
in its transparent bosom so beautiful, so bright, I
could scarcely believe it was not some world of spirituality,
some realm of bliss. The scene was changedâwinter
had stripped it of all its attractionsâthe blast
howled through the leafless treesâand the stream that
had meandered so sweetly through the verdant plain,
was now roaring down its channel with impetuous force.
[Pg 238]

The scene was changed; but he who looked on it was
not less so.

Morning of life! too soon oâercast,

Young days of bliss, too dear to lose;

Ah! whither have thy visions past

That brightenâd all my childish views?

For never yet when poets muse,

Or maidens dream in bowers alone,

Were glorious visions more profuse,

Ah! whither have those visions gone?
[17]

I was roused from one of memoryâs sweetest dreams,
by the distant sound of bellsâthey were those of my
native cityâI had often heard them at the same hourâthey
spoke of wo, devotion, and joy, and scenes long
gone by. In this softened state of feeling I entered the
town, and, heedless of the throng, I hurried on to the
home of my parentsâreached the houseâthrew myself
into their arms, and the first tumult of feeling over, I
sat at the fireside, with my father on the one side, and
my mother at the other, gazing affectionately upon me,
while I talked of all I had seen, and all I had felt.

Being tired after my journey, my mother suggested
the propriety of my going to rest; and the tender hand
that had often smoothed my pillow, again performed
that office. I could not help comparing my situation
with the nights that I had lain exposed to the storm,
with the cold earth for my bed; and I felt a lively
impulse of gratitudeâworth a thousand formal prayersâto
the Divine Being, who had watched over, and
protected me through every danger, and brought me
in safety back to my home and my parents.

While my mind was occupied in these reflections,
my mother again entered my chamber to see if I wanted
anything. âAre you asleep, Josephââmy eyes were
shut, and I did not reply. She stood over me with the
light in her hand gazing on my weather-beaten countenance.
âMy poor wanderer!â she ejaculated, âwhat
[Pg 239]

must you have endured since I last saw you. Danger
and death has surrounded you, fatigue and hunger
attended your steps; but yet you have been kindly
dealt with, mercifully preserved. I return thee thanks,
thou Almighty giver of every good, for thy bounteous
mercy to my poor boyâO guide him to thyself!â She
stooped to kiss my foreheadâher warm tears fell upon
my faceâmy emotions became too strong for concealment,
and afraid that she had disturbed my sleep, she
softly left the room.

Those who have felt the rude storms of adversity,
and the endearing kindness of a mother, will appreciate
my feelings on this occasion.

FOOTNOTES:

[17]
This expression of my feelings may appear, to some, like bombast
or affected feelingâI care not. I appeal to those who have felt an
enthusiastic love of nature; if it touches a responding chord in their
bosoms, I am satisfied.

CHAPTER VI.

STORY OF WILLIAM.

While in winter quarters, in the latter end of 1812, a
detachment of recruits joined us from the depot at
home, some of whom were attached to our company.
Among them was a lad of the name of William Young,
a native of Glasgow. His conduct and character were
so strikingly different from that of his comrades, that
he soon became an object of remark. He might then
be about eighteen or nineteen years of age, prepossessing
in his appearance; but his countenance was âsicklied
oâer with the pale cast of thought,ââsomething seemed
to lie heavy at his heart. When not on duty he was
in the habit of wandering much by himself, and, unless
when he could not avoid it, he rarely spoke to any one.
When the weather did not permit him to ramble, he
occupied himself in reading a small pocket Bible, which
he always carried about with him, and often, while
thus engaged, the tears could be seen trickling down
his cheeks. Those of course were considered symptoms
of religious feeling, and as such were ridiculed by the
more brutal and illiterate part of his comrades; it was,
however, confined to them, for there is a sacredness
[Pg 240]

attached to even the appearance of religion in the minds
of those who have been brought up by religious parents,
that however lax their own morality may be, prevents
them from turning it into ridicule. Their hearts still
cherish the recollection of the holy feelings which have
been excited in their younger years, and untainted at
the core, sigh to think they do not now feel as they
were wont, that purity and happiness which by association
must ever be connected with their religious observances.
I felt interested in him, and soon acquired
his confidence so far, that he confided to me the outlines
of his story, up to the time of his enlisting. There
seemed, however, to be a feeling of self-contempt mixed
up with his grief, that prevented him from entering
particularly into the circumstances which led to that
step. What I learned was, that he had left a widowed
mother and a sister behind, who had depended in a
great measure upon him for support; that the Bible,
which he was in the habit of reading, was the gift of
his mother, when they parted; and although he felt
pleasure and consolation from scanning its contents,
there were other feelings connected with it which often
led his thoughts far from what he was reading, and
raised emotions in his mind that brought tears from his
eyes. Without seeking to pry into what he seemed
inclined to conceal, I endeavoured, by every means in
my power, to turn the current of his thoughts into some
other channel, but my efforts were unavailing; the destitute
manner in which he had left his mother seemed
to prey upon his mind, and although he conformed
himself well enough to the duties he had to perform,
yet he still remained the same melancholy, abstracted
being as when I first knew him.

We had advanced some way into France, when one
evening we were walking together, and talking of the
possibility of our soon seeing home, as we had now
some reason to expect peace.

âI hope,â said he, âthat I will live to return to my
poor mother; but if it should be my fate to fall, and
yours to survive, there is one request I have to make.â

[Pg 241]

âWhat is that?â said I.

âThat you will send home this Bible to my mother;
I have fastened a lock of my hair at a place she will
remember, and think with pity and forgiveness of me
when I am no more.â

âDonât let such melancholy reflections get the better
of you,â said I; âstill hope for the best. I trust we
shall both see our native land again, but should there
be any necessity for it, and I survive, I will faithfully
perform what you wish.â

A few days after, the battle of Orthes was fought.
At night when the companies were mustered, poor
William was missing: he had been detached with the
sharp-shooters in the morning, to cover the advance
of the column, and had been killed by a grape shot in
the early part of the day. We were far past the place
where he had fallen, and I could not return even had
there been any chance of finding him among the
numbers of dead and wounded that strewed the field.
But he had given his Bible in charge to an officerâs
servant, with whom he was acquainted, to place among
his masterâs baggage, as a place of greater security,
from whom I received it, previous to our embarkation
at Pauilhac, for Ireland. Between the Old and New
Testaments, on the blank page, was fastened a lock of
his hair, so disposed as to encircle the following passages,
which were copied in a small hand, with the chapter
and verse of each annexed:â

âRefrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from
tears, for there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that
thy children shall come again unto their own border.â

âFear not, thy Maker is thine husband.â

âCommit thy fatherless children to my care.â

âCall upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.â

THE INTERVIEW.

Having brought the Bible home with me, I had now
the melancholy task to perform, of delivering it to his
[Pg 242]

aged mother. Accordingly, when I had been a few
days at home, I sought out her dwelling. She was
absent when I first called; but I left the book, with a
note, explaining the nature of my visit, and promising
to return next day.

Agreeable to promise, having called at her house, I
rapped at the door, but no one answered, and lifting
the latch, to try whether it was locked, it opened, and
I discovered the old woman sitting at a table, with the
small Bible that I had brought, open before her, at the
place which had been so particularly addressed to
herself; her eyes were red with weeping, and she was
so absorbed in grief, that she did not observe my
entrance. Sensible that I had intruded rather abruptly,
I attempted to withdraw; but she happened to lift up
her head, and seeing a soldier in uniform, she rose
hastily and came towards me: âAre you the kind lad
that was here yesterday with this?â (pointing to the
Bible.) âI dinna ken how to be thankfuâ enough to
you for being the bearer of my puir Willieâs dyinâ
bequest. Come in anâ sit down. I was in a manner
prepared forât, by the kind considerate letter you sent
me, and I thocht that I couâd have borneât wiâ some
fortitude; but the sight oâ my dear laddieâs hand-writing
and the lock oâ his hair, has opened aâ my wounds
afresh. But I would be hard, hard hearted if I didna
grieve for the loss oâ him that was aye sae guid and
kind to me. Oh! the sight oâ that Bible brings things
to my mind that maist dries up my heart aâ thegither;
and if it wasna for the comfort thatâs inât, (that I hae
always experienced) wad drive me out oâ my senses.
It was bought on the day oâ my weddinâ, and was
carried wiâ me when I first entered the Lordâs house,
after being joined heart anâ hanâ wiâ a man that has left
few like him behind. For twenty years, in joy anâ in
trouble, it was my companion; and, alas! weel do I
mind it, frae this book I read the blessed anâ faithfuâ
promises oâ God to my dear husband in his last hours;
anâ when the pangs oâ death were on him, anâ he held
my hanâ in his, takinâ, as I thocht, an everlastinâ
[Pg 243]

fareweel oâ me, when my heart was burstinâ wiâ grief, the
assurance giâen me there that I would again meet wiâ
him, gied me consolation in the midst oâ my distress.

âWhen my boy listed, and was leaving me, I gied
him this Bible, charging him never to forget the reading
oât, for there he wad find comfort in the hour oâ
trouble.â

âAnd it gives me pleasure,â said I, âto inform you
that he followed your advice.â

âO ay! I am sure he did,â replied she, âI canna
doubt but his heart was right.â

âHis listinâ was a sair heart-break to me, for he had
aye been sae guid anâ sae kind, anâ was the only stay
that I had. Did he ever tell you what was the reason
oâ him listinâ?â

âNo,â said I.

âNo, no, he was owre proud-spirited for that, puir
fellow; but he is no the first that a silly woman has
driven to ruin; anâ itâs a waesome thocht to me that a
heart like his shouâd hae been thrown awaâ on a worthless
tawpy, that didna care a preen about him.â

Having expressed a wish to hear the story to which
she alluded, she proceeded:

CHAPTER VII.

THE MOTHERâS STORY.

âWhen my gudeman died, I was left wiâ twa bairns, a
boy anâ a girl. We had six in family, but Willie and
Mary were aâ the Lord was pleased to leave wiâ us.
It was by dint oâ hard wark that I could keep them in
meat anâ claes, anâ giâe them schoolinâ; but they were
guid bairns, anâ when Willie cam in frae his school, anâ
sat down by my wheel side, anâ asked me to let him
read the bonny lesson for me that he had learned out
oâ that Bible, I couâdna been happier if I had been
possessed oâ aâ Glasgow. They baith grew up fond oâ
me, anâ fond oâ ane anither, anâ Willie improved sae
[Pg 244]

much in his education that I got him engaged in a
warehouse as a clerk, where he gied great satisfaction
to his master; and when he cam hame at night, instead
of spending his time like idle, glaiket creatures oâ his
ain age, he wouâd sit anâ read for his sister anâ me, or
else be busy at his drawing, or sometimes he would
play the flute, while Mary sang, and I wad sit wiâ my
heart at my mouth wiâ perfect joy. Oh! thae were
happy daysâlittle did I then think that I wad now be
sittinâ mourninâ the loss oâ aâ that I thocht worth livinâ
for. Yet I had a mistrust about me, that I was owre
happy for ât to last lang; but oh I didna think I was
to drink the cup oâ affliction sae deep as I hae done.â

The old womanâs feelings here became uncontrollable,
and the tears trickled down her furrowed cheeks in
quick succession; but, recovering herself in a few
minutes, she clasped her hands, and, looking up to
Heaven with pious resignation, she said, ââThy will
be done,âââThe Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away,
blessed be the name of the Lord,ââI hope Iâll soon
meet wiâ them, where weâll neâer part again.â

She continued:ââWillie had been about three years
in the warehouse, anâ his maister had such a respect
for him, that he gied Mary anâ me as much sewing as
we couâd do at hame.

âIt was about this time that we got neebors in the
house but anâ ben wiâ us,âkind anâ sober foâk they
were, anâ we were unco freendly wiâ ane anither. They
had ae dochter that their hearts were bund up in, owre
muckle bund up for her gude. She was as bonny a
lassie as ye couâd hae seen in a dayâs walkinâ, anâ free
anâ light-hearted; but she was sae much dawted by
her faither anâ mother, anâ her beauty sae roosed by
ither foâk, that stronger heads than herâs micht been
turnâd wiât.

âFor companyâs sake she used to come in anâ sit wiâ
her wark beside Mary, anâ they turnâd unco fond oâ ane
anither, anâ at nicht when Willie cam hame, they wad
sing while he playâd the flute; anâ at length we seemed
just like ae family.

[Pg 245]

âIn a short time I couâd see that Willie was mair
taâen up wiâ Jessie, anâ she wiâ him, than I couâd hae
wished; if she happened no to be in when he cam hame,
he was dowie anâ restless, anâ couâdna content himselâ
at his books or his drawinâ the way he used to do. I
was vexed to see this for twa or three reasons: in the
first place, they were owre young to think on marryinâ;
anâ in the next, she wasna the kind oâ woman I wad
hae wished Willie for a wife. She was owre fond oâ
dress, anâ folk admiring her, to suit his sober, douce
temper; anâ I saw that it wad be a sair struggle for
his heart. But as what was done couâdna be mended,
I resolved to lippen to Providence, hoping that every
thing wad turn out for the best. They now began to
meet out oâ the house, anâ the langer they were acquainted,
I could see that Willieâs heart was the deeper
in love; but Jessie didna seem to keep up wiâ him in
that respect. She had owre great a likinâ for herselâ
to spare much to him; her affection for him raise anâ
sank wiâ every turn oâ her flighty head,âae day she
wad be dyinâ wiâ kindness about him because he had
on some dress that took her fancy, anâ she wad parade
wiâ him round the town; anither time she wad refuse
to walk wiâ him, because his hat or his napkin wasna
in the fashion. I often wondered that Willie put up
wiâ aâ her fancies; for he wasna easy imposed on wiâ
other folk, but wiâ her he seemed as if he was bewitched.

THE COQUET.

âAbout this time, Jessie, wha had been at a dancing-school,
was to be at a practisinâ ball, anâ gied Willie
anâ Mary tickets. Puir things, nane oâ them had ever
learned to dance, for besides no being very sure aboot
the propriety oâ the thing, I thought that dancing wasna
very necessarâ in their station oâ life; but their curiosity
had been raised sae much wiâ Jessieâs description,
that they were keen to gang, and although I wad been
better pleased that they had staid at hame, they had
aye been sae guid that I couldna think to deny them.

[Pg 246]

âJessie cam in for them that night, busked up like
ony lady, wiâ her white gown anâ flounces anâ spangles,
her neck and arms bare, and her head dressed out wiâ
artificial flowers, and her white satin shoon tied up in
her pocket napkin, to put on when she gaed into the
ball-room. I could scarcely believe my ain eenâI
glanced at her, and syne at Willieâhe looked as if he
could have faâen down and worshipped herâand for a
moment I was proud to think that my son should hae
sic a sweetheart: but when I thocht on what micht be
the upshot oâ aâ this, I couldna help sighinâ anâ sayinâ
to myselâ, âI wish this mayna end in breakinâ my puir
laddieâs heart.â

âWeel, they gaed to the ball, but it was a waesome
ball to Willie: he was obliged to sit lookinâ on, while
she was skimminâ through the dance wiâ ither lads.
This he bore wiâ some patience, but when she rose up
to dance some new-fashioned dance, (a waltz, I think
she caâd it,) and he saw a strange ladâs arms twined
aboot her in a manner that he would have thocht it
sacrilege to attempt, he couldna bear longerâhis head
grew confused, and the measure oâ his vexation was
filled up by a lad coming owre anâ asking Mary to
stand up to dance wiâ him; poor Mary was obliged to
tell the truth. âCanna dance!â said the lad in surprise.
Willie didna wait for ony mair, but takinâ Maryâs hanâ,
âCome awa,â said he, âwe canna stay here to be
affronted.â I was surprised to see them come hame sae
soon, and asked him the reason: he made some trifling
excuse; but when he gaed to his bed, Mary told me
the hale story.

âNext day he was dowie anâ thochtfuâ, his pride
was hurt, anâ he was jealous oâ Jessie, but he didna
speak. When he cam hame at night she was in, anâ
before he had time to speak, she cried out, âO Willie,
what gart ye gang awa anâ leave me; I waited lookinâ
for you through the room when I wanted to gang hame,
but I couldna find ye. Ye wad be vext seeinâ aâ the
rest dancinâ, anâ you no able: what a pity you canna
dance, Willie; if ye could, Iâm sure naebody should be
[Pg 247]

my partner but yourselâ, for I couldna see onybody
there that I liked sae weel.â This was plenty, Willieâs
een brightened, anâ he took her handââWill you be
sure to keep your promise, Jessie, if I learn before
the next ball?â âAs sure as I have life,â said she. He
looked at me. I kent what he meant. O ay, Willie,
you have my consent to gang to the school, anâ tak
Mary wiâ yeâitâs no against the dancinâ itselâ that I
have sae much objection, as what it leads to. My
mind tellâd me I was doinâ wrang, but I couldna help
beinâ pleased to think it was makinâ him sae happy.
Weel, to the dancinâ-school they gaed, anâ books, anâ
drawinâ anâ every thing was laid aside. He was clever
at ony thing, but his mind was so much set on this,
that he couldna but learn fast, and by the next ball he
was able to dance wiâ Jessie himselâ. But, poor fellow,
aâ his endeavours seemed vain, for Jessie was asked
that night to dance wiâ a lad who was the brag oâ the
country side. He was a fine-lookinâ chiel, I believe,
but puffed up wiâ vanity. The twa gaed through some
new-fangled dance by themselâsâevery body roosed
them to the skies, and they turned the prouder the
mair they heard themselâs praised. Instead oâ cominâ
owre beside Willie when it was finished, Jessie sat
down beside her new partner. Willie, you may be
sure, was unhappy enough before, but his heart was
like to burst within him when he saw her hearkening
wiâ delight to some nonsense the chiel was sayinâ to
her. He could thole nae langer, and he gaed owre to
her and asked if she would stand up wiâ him the next
dance; but she answered (in a way as if she was
ashamed of being seen speaking to him) that she was
engaged. Willie said nae mair before the lad, but
he sat patiently until the ball was ended, thinking he
might have an opportunity of speaking to her on the
road hame; but her new lad saw her into her fatherâs
door. That night Willie didna close an eye, and my
heart was like to break for him, the way he sighed the
hale nicht lang. Like maist folk, when they do wrang,
they think they have the best right to be offended, so
[Pg 248]

Jessie didna look near our house the next day, until
Mary gaed in for her. âWhat ailed you at Willie last
night?â said Mary, willing to bring about some explanation;
âI fear you vext him unco sair by leavinâ him
to dance wiâ yon ideot.â ââDeed then,â replied Jessie,
âhe needna fash to be vexâd about it, for I wadna tie
myselâ down to please him or ony ither body; does he
really think, because I consented to be his partner at
the ball, that I obliged myselâ no to dance wiâ ony
body but him?â âIt was na because you danced wiâ
ony ither body,â said Mary, âalthough he had your
ain promise for that, but because you left his company
aâthegether, that he wad finâ vexâd.â âTuts, I canna
be fashâd wiâ him aye rinninâ after me frae place to
place, and aye sittinâ beside me.â âYou didna aye
think sae,â said Mary, looking her in the face; âbut
although ye couldna be fashed wiâ him, there was
ither folk there, far inferior to him, that you could sit
beside till the last minute.â âWha isât you caâ inferior
to him? I am sure the lad I was wiâ is a far bonnier
lad, and a far better dancer, than ever heâll be in his
life.â This observation oâ hers brought the tears in my
een, for I saw my poor laddieâs heart was gien to ane
that wad tread it under her feet, and laugh while she
did it.

âFor twa or three days after this, he gaed about
like a ghaist; he couldna takâ his meat through the
day, nor his sleep at night, and I was fearâd that he
wad bring some trouble on himselâ. He had tried twa
or three times, I understood, to get a word oâ Jessie by
herselâ, but she refused to see him. Mary had seen
her ance or twice walkinâ wiâ her new sweetheart.
Willie had heard this, and ae night he watchâd her
until she parted wiâ him, and met her cominâ through
her ain entry. I happenâd to be gaun out, but seeinâ a
glimpse oâ twa folk in the passage, I stopped short and
oâerheard Willie say, âJessie, I wish to speak to you.â
âI have nae time to speak to you,â said she, pressing to
get past him. âIâll no keep you lang, and as it is likely
it may be the last time Iâll request it, I hope youâll hear
[Pg 249]

me.â âWeel, what hae ye to say.â âI find by your
manner of speakinâ that itâll no be necessary to say
much. I only wish to know whether, considering what
has passed between us, you have any excuse to make for
your conduct to me of late?â âNo; what business have
I to make any excuse to you? Let me go.â âO Jessie,
your words would signify little, if I didna ken that your
conduct was like them. Like a fool, I ance thought
your heart was aâ my ain. You have deceived me,
Jessie, broken my heart; but I canna wish you ill.
May you never have your conduct to me returned on
your own head. Although you have deserted me, you
will never find one to love you as I have done; but I
donât say this to make you feel for me, or to bring
back your lost affections. You never could be to me
what you have been, and I wouldna lay my heart,
broken as it is, again at your mercy, for any consideration.
Farewell, Jessie, I wish you every happiness.â
She appeared to be affected, for I could hear her sabbinâ;
but she didna makâ ony reply.

âAlthough he pretended that he was heart-hale
again, I couâd see that the battle my poor laddie was
fightinâ in his ain breast was owre hard for him. Two
or three days after he was beyond his usual hour oâ
cominâ in to his dinner, and I fand myselâ unco uneasy
about him, for he was aye particular to the hour. It
was sax oâclock before he cam hame. âWhat keepit
ye, my laddie?â says I, âyeâre far ayont your time.â
âI was busy,â says he, careless like,âand I didna
think ony mair about it. Next day he cam hame in
the middle oâ the day, âWhatâs wrang now, Willie?â
says I, âare ye no weel, that you are hame at this
hour?â He sat for a long while without saying a
word, and then burst into tears,ââO no, mother!
Iâm no weel, nor have na been weel this mony a day;
but there will soon be an end oât, for Iâm gaun to leave
the town.â âMy goodness! laddie, whare are ye gaun?
what do ye mean?â âI canna hide it ony langer, mother;
1 am listed for a soldier, and I have to march this night
to join my regiment.â âListed!â said I, and the word
[Pg 250]

stuck in my throat, âO! no, Willie, that canna be
sae;â but I could see by his face that it was owre
trueâhe wasna guilty oâ telling lees. âO! then, for
Godsake, for my sake, if ye dinna wish to send your
auld mither to her grave, gang and gie them back
their siller. Iâll sell every thing I hae to get ye free.
O haste ye, William, and pay them the smart.â Willie
shook his head,ââItâs owre late for that.â âThen
yeâre lost, my bairnâmy aâ that I have for your fatherâmy
only dependence! O! and where is your
regiment?â âIn Portugal.â I didna hear ony mair,
my head grew dizzy, the cauld sweat broke on my
face; I thought I was dyinâ, and I was happy at it.

âI minded naething mair until I wakened as it
were frae a sleep, and looking up saw Mary and Willie
hanging owre me greetinâ. My mind during the rest oâ
that day was aâ confusion; I mind something about
soldiers cominâ for Willie, and me takinâ fareweel oâ
him, and gieing him this Bible, and seeinâ his sister
clasped in his arms; but there was something cauld at
my heart, I had lost my natural feelinâ. I fand as if
I had swallowed laudanum. In the middle oâ the night
I wakened frae a fearfuâ dreamâI had seen my Willie
torn frae me, and stretchinâ out his hands to me for
help; but he was dragged frae my sightâagain he
appeared to me, pale and bluidy, and his claiths dreepinâ
wat. I sprang forward to catch him in my arms; but
before I could reach him he fell on the floor; the
scream that I gied wakened me, and I fand myselâ
standinâ at my bedside, for I had jumped out in the
distress oâ my mind. I had nae clear notion oâ ony
thing; but I had a confused thought that there was
something wrang wiâ my Willie, and I staggered into
the wee room where he sleepitâI hearkenâd to hear
his breath, but aâ was hushâdâI grew fearfuâ anxious,
and to satisfy myselâ I stretched my hand on the bed,
to feel if he was there; but there was naebody inâtâthe
claes were na ruffled, and the cauld feel oâ the
quilt affected my heart, as if it had been squeezed
between twa pieces oâ ice. I sunk on the bedâWhat
[Pg 251]

can aâ this mean? said I to myselâ, and the truth gradually
opened on my mind. O ay, itâs owre true,âyeâre
gane, Willie,âyeâve left me; what for did ye no
tell me before ye took sic a rash step? O Willie, will
I never see you again?âWhat mischief that glaiket,
heartless hizzie has done. May she be made to sufferâbut
I stopped myselâ in the rash wishâthere was
nae need forâtâpoor wretch, she was fast fillinâ the
bitter cup for herselâ.

âI was sittinâ in this way, mourninâ for my bairn,
until I had forgotten where I was, when I was started
by somebody sabbinâ by my side. âIn Godâs name,
whaâs that?â âItâs me, mother,â said Mary, âare ye no
cominâ to your bed?â âO ay, my bairn; I wish the
Lord may keep me in my natural senses, for I find my
head no right ava.â Mary tried to comfort me, but, poor
thing, she needed comfort as much as myselâ. I need
scarcely gang farther wiâ my story, my heart never
raise aboonât.

âAbout a week after he left us, we had a letter frae
him, wiâ an order for ten pounds inât. It was his bounty.
He said he was weel and happy, and begged that I
would buy claes for myselâ and Mary wiâ the siller.
Although I was proud of his affection and his mindfuâness,
yet before I would have used a penny oâ that
siller, I wad have starved. I couldna considerât in ony
light but as the price oâ his bluid. Mary saw what
was passinâ in my mind when we read the letterâher
feelings were the same as mine.ââIâll tell you what
we will do, mother,â said she, âweâll put the siller in
the bank, and weâll work hard, and put something tillât
if we can, and by the time that he comes hame again,
heâll hae forgotton aâ this business between Jessie and
him, and weâll buy his discharge, and get him hame
beside us again.â I couldna help claspinâ my kind-hearted
lassie to my bosom. âWeel, Mary, my dear,
weâll just do that, and weâll maybe be aâ happy yet.â

âThe next letter we had frae Willie, he was in
France wiâ the army? he had joined his regiment the
day before a battle, and escaped without scaith. The
[Pg 252]

neist we had frae him, he was in high spirits: âThe war,â
he said, âcouldna be lang oâ beinâ ended, and he would
see us again.â We were quite uplifted. We had
added sae much to the ten pound we had in the bank
by our hard workinâ, that it was now nearhand
twenty, and we were planninâ how we would surprise
him by gettinâ his discharge, when he cam hame.

âWe had giâen up our house, intendinâ to remove to
anither quarter oâ the town, to be awa frae Jessie and
her friends; but that wasna necessarâ. Jessie had been
courtinâ wiâ the lad that she had giâen up Willie for
ever since he had gaen awa. It was reported for a
lang while that they were to be married; but when aâ
thing was prepared, and the day appointed, he set aff
and wasna heard oâ for some weeks. They were in an
awfuâ way about it, but at length they got word frae a
near friend oâ his, that he had sailed for America wiâ
his wife, having married anither lass twa or three days
before he sailed. This was dreadfuâ news to poor
Jessie, she couldna haud up her head afterât, and her
father and mother removed to a different part of the
country, takinâ her wiâ themâI hae neâer heard what
becam oâ them since.

âWeel, as I was sayinâ, we had every thing planned
out, and waitinâ anxiously for anither letter. We had
heard by the papers that the allied troops were marching
for Paris; every day brought fresh news, until at length
we saw the mail-coach rattle past our door wiâ flags
fleeinâ. Peace, peace, was in ilka bodyâs mouthâevery
body that had friends in the army were rinninâ
frae door to door congratulating ane anither, and every
body was overjoyed.

âOrders were giâen fer an illumination. âThat Iâll
do wiâ aâ my heart,â says I, âfor I hope my laddieâs on
his passage hame.â âO mother?â cried Mary, âhereâs
the postman wiâ a letter for you.â My heart lap to
my mouthâI ran into the room and toreât openââThis
will be gude news frae Willie. O Mary, read it,
for Iâm sae flurried that I canna read.â âPreserve us,â
says she, âthatâs no Willieâs writing.â âNever mind,â
[Pg 253]

says I; âread, read.â She read on hurriedly to herselâ,
but while she read, her face turnâd ghastly paleâthe letter
drapped frae her handsââO! mother, heâs killâd,ââand
she sank down before me, without me havinâ power to
help her.

âOh!â said the old woman, passing her hand across
her forehead. âI canna think about that day, but my
head turns, and Iâm no myselâ.â

CHAPTER VIII.

DENNIS.

My leave of absence flew swiftly by, and I had again
to bid my friends farewell, and return to my regiment.
When I arrived, I found my comrade Dennis, along
with some others, standing in full marching order, with
his arms carried, and his face within a few inches of
the barrack wall, in which position he was sentenced
to remain during three successive days, from sunrise to
sunset, for being absent when the roll was called at
tattoo. This was a new invented punishment, intended
as a mild substitute for flogging, but in my opinion
more severe and injurious to the health. Our moral
physicians seem to consider bodily pain as the grand
panacea for all errors of the mind. It is strange how
precedent or prejudice should guide men of information
on these points; it proceeds either from indolence,
which prevents them thinking at all, or their passions
are so much stronger than their reason, that they act
contrary to their better judgment. The latter is the
most common of the two.

The fault of poor Dennis, had it been inquired into,
did not deserve the severe punishment with which it
was visited. His sweetheart, Peggy Doyle, had been
seized with typhus fever, which was at that time prevalent.
The common people in Ireland have a dread of
fever almost incredible. The nearest relations of the
sick will often refuse to visit them, and many times the
[Pg 254]

suffering individual is almost totally deserted, unless
there be some devoted wife, child, or mother, whose
affection is stronger than the fear of death. Poor
Peggy had caught the infection from a family, one of
the girls of whom was her particular friend; the whole
of the family, consisting of five individuals, were
unfortunately ill at the same time, and Peggy, finding
that no one would attend them, heedless of all selfish
considerations, had given up her place to become their
nurse. The father and a little boy died, but the two
girls and the mother became convalescent. During
this time she had been often assisted by Dennis, who
shared cheerfully with her in the labour and danger to
which her disinterested benevolence had exposed her.
While they were ill, she had remained perfectly healthy,
but the disease was working in her blood, and her friends
were scarcely able to crawl about, when their kind
nurse was stretched on the bed from which they had
just risen, with every symptom of the disorder more
aggravated than that from which they had recovered.

This was a heart-breaking business to poor Dennis;
every moment he could spare he was at her bedside,
and the night on which he had been absent from roll-calling,
she was so ill, that, in his anxiety for her, he
had forgot the hour of tattoo, and the reports were given
in before he reached the barrack. I exerted the little
influence I possessed to get Dennis forgiven, and was
successful, and to prevent any misunderstanding, I got
leave for myself and him for the night. When this
point was gained, I accompanied him to see poor Peggy,
but being insensible, she did not know me; she did
not rave, but there was a deadly stupor in her eye.
Poor Dennis was affected to the heart, but he endeavoured
to bear it with fortitude. The girls were still
too weak to endure the fatigue, and were in bed, but
the mother sat beside us. It was evident that life was
now fast ebbingâher eye became more glazed, the livid
circle round her mouth became deeper, and her respiration
more laborious. We had been sitting in silence
for some time, watching the progress of dissolution,
[Pg 255]

when we were startled by the melancholy and lengthened
howl of a dog, outside the door. I cannot, need
not, attempt to describe the effect it had upon us.

âAh! thatâs a sure sign,â said the old woman, when
she recovered herself, âthe poor child will soon be
gone.â

I am not very superstitious, and I strove to dispel
the emotion I felt by going to discover the dog. I found
him seated on the street opposite the door, with his
face turned towards it. He was well known to the
regiment, for he frequented the barrack-square, and
whenever the bugles sounded, he emitted the same kind
of howl he had done that night. The knowledge of this
in a measure quieted my mind, but I could not altogether
rid myself of the strange impression created by
the incident. Having returned to Peggyâs bedside, I
found her much worse; the death-rattle was in her
throat, and a long and distressing moan every two or
three minutes, told how dreadful was the struggle.

The old woman awakened her daughters. âRise, my
dear girls,â said she, âand pray for the soul of her who
is losing her life for your sakes.â

By the time they got up she was in the agonies of
death.

âFall down on your knees, my childer,â said she,
âand pray to God to smooth her way to heaven.â

We sunk down with one accord by the bedside, and
while they offered up their fervent prayers, her soul
winged its way to a world where her benevolent deeds
would be appreciated and rewarded. Poor Dennis had
held her hand in his for some time before she died, and
he did not relinquish it, until the old woman came over
to him and said, âO Dennis, astore, she is gone!â when
he started to his feet, and gazing intensely on the corpse
for a few minutes, he stooped down and imprinted a
last kiss on her cold and livid lips, which but a few
days before had glowed in all the vermilion of health;
then turning about, he sat down in a corner of the
room without saying a word.

After a pause of an hour, during which they were
[Pg 256]

busily employed in offering up prayers for the soul of
the deceased,ââCome, my dear,â said the mother to
the elder girl, âwe may as well get her laid out while
she is warm, for I believe she hasnât much to travel.
[18]

Boys, you had better go home and try and get some
rest.â

Dennis was for guard next day, and could not accompany
me; but when I returned I found the old woman
and her daughters, weak as they were, had not been
idle. The bed on which Peggy had lain was removed
and burnt, the walls of both apartments white-washed
with lime, and the floor strewed with mint and lavender.
On the room door, which had been unhinged for the
purpose, and placed resting on two chairs, was stretched
the dead body, covered with a white sheet all but the face,
which now wore a composed smile. Three candles
lighted were placed at her head, ornamented with cut
paper. Though the morning had been stormy, the
younger girl had gone out and collected such flowers
as the season afforded,âthe snowdrop, the primrose,
and the evergreen, and strewed them on the corpse.

The same dread that prevented the neighbours from
visiting her in her sickness, restrained them from attending
her wake; but it was so much the betterânone but
true hearts mourned over herâno tears were shed but
those of affectionâthere was no boisterous or disgraceful
mirth, such as I have witnessed on similar occasions.
A few neighbours, more friendly than others, ventured
into the outer apartment, and remained during the
night; but the old woman and the two girls sat alternately,
and sometimes together, at the head of the
corpseâand apostrophizing the inanimate clay, they
ran over every endearing quality that she possessed,
adverted to the happy moments they had passed in her
[Pg 257]

company, and with the tears trickling over their cheeks,
chaunted the plaintive airs which she was partial to, and
had often joined them in singing.

There was something in the scene so impressive and
solemn, and in the simple tribute of affection to the
remains of their friend so touching, that it was impossible
to witness it without the heart whispering âit is
good to be here.â Having gone out for a few minutes
to warm myself at the fire where the neighbours were
sitting, I overheard one of the women repeating an
irregular rhyme.

âWhat is the meaning of that?â said I.

âItâs a rhyme,â replied she, âthat a poor innocent
who frequented this used to repeat, and we happened
to be talking about her.â

I expressed a wish to hear something concerning
her; and in a detached and irregular manner she told
me the following story:â

Molly Kelly was the daughter of a small farmer in
an adjoining county. She had been seduced by a
young man of the same neighbourhood under promise
of marriage, which he delayed to fulfil so long, that
Mary, finding herself in a situation she could not long
conceal, disclosed the secret to her mother. Knowing
that her father was of a stern, unforgiving temper, she
endeavoured to keep it from his knowledge, but it was
soon found necessary to tell even him. In his first
transports of rage, he threatened to take her life, and
her mother was obliged to conceal her from his fury;
she endeavoured to excite his pity for the unfortunate
girl, but all she could get him to do was to restrain his
anger until he saw whether the young man would
marry her, who was accordingly sent for, but he refused
in the most insulting terms. This was communicated
by the heart-broken mother to Mary, who at the
same time warned her of her fatherâs anger, and advised
her to go to a relationâs house at some distance, until
he could be brought to forgive her; this Mary at first
refused to do, but her mother urged her departure, and
she at length consented.

[Pg 258]

Having reached her friendâs house, she remained
there until within a few days of the delivery of her
child, when she left it without giving any intimation,
and wandered as far as her precarious situation permitted.
She was seized with the pains of labour in a
cottage where she had gone in to rest herself, and was
delivered of a daughter before she left it. The people
were kind to her, and administered every thing to her
comfort their circumstances admitted; but poor Maryâs
distress of mind enhanced her danger; she was seized
with violent inflammation and became delirious. The
disorder, however, at length subsided, and she gradually
recovered her health, but her reason was gone for ever.

Her situation was taken notice of by some kind-hearted
people, and they meditated taking the child
from her; but she was so harmless, and so fond of the
babe, grew so uneasy and even frantic when any one
attempted to take it, and besides had so much natural
nourishment for it, that they allowed it to remain with
her.

For nearly a twelvemonth she roved about from
one place to another subsisting on charity, when the
child caught the small-pox; at first she did not seem to
understand that it was sick, but when the disorder
came to a height, she felt uneasy at seeing the pustules
which covered its skin, and one day she carried the
poor infant to a stream and endeavoured to wash them
off with a wisp of straw. Some person passing discovered
her thus employed, and interfered to save the
child, but it was too late,âit had expired in her hands;
and she would not part with it until it was forcibly
taken from her to be buried.

From this time the disorder of her mind assumed a
different character. She would not enter a house, but
slept about old walls or barns, and mourned continually
for her child. Some one thought of giving her a large
doll by the way of quieting her mind, and the experiment
was so far successful; she lavished the same
fondness on it, dressed it, and nursed it, as if it had
been a living child; but she still avoided going into
[Pg 259]

the houses, unless when the weather was very severe;
then she would seek some favourite house, and chaunt
over the rhyme at the door, that I heard the woman repeat
on my coming out of the room:â

âOpen the door to pretty Polly, for this is a cold winter night;

It rains, it hails, it blows, and the elements give no light.â

Her petition was never in vain, for they were all
fond of poor Molly; but her constitution could not
long withstand the constant exposure to the weather;
her health gradually gave way, and one morning the
wretched victim of seduction and parental cruelty was
found dead by the side of a ditch.

FOOTNOTES:

[18]
It is generally believed among the common people of this part of
Ireland, that when the soul leaves its earthly tenement, the first
thing it does is to travel over every spot of ground that the body did
while living; during which time the tie between it and its mortal
remains is not entirely severed; and for that reason they will not
touch the body for a certain time after life is extinct.

CHAPTER IX.

CHANGE OF QUARTERS.

We had been about nine months here when we got
the route to march to Kilkenny, a distance of about
forty miles, where we were destined to relieve the
forty-second regiment, ordered on service. We parted
with the people of Wexford with regret, and on their
part with every demonstration of sorrow. Many of
our men had married while in the town, and every
thing during our stay conspired in a degree to identify
us with the inhabitants.

We were escorted some miles by half the people of
the town. A meeting was called of the magistrates
and principal inhabitants, and an address drawn up,
flattering alike to our feelings and pride, which was
published in the principal newspapers. Thus we entered
Kilkenny in the best possible disposition to be on friendly
terms with its inhabitants, but we soon found that we
had got a different kind of people to deal with. The
sneers and oblique hints, the evident wish to quarrel,
which they evinced when any of our men came in contact
with them in the public-house, convinced us that we
could never expect to be on the same terms with them
as we had been with the inhabitants of Wexford.

[Pg 260]

The county being almost continually in a disturbed
state, it was found necessary to have a large force distributed
throughout its extent, to counteract their
lawless schemes, and caused the duty to be particularly
unpleasant. On our part it was not a little enhanced
by the envious egotism and gasconading of the corps
whom we relieved,âa corps that has been flattered
by the country into a belief that they are the flower
of the British army. To hear themselves speak, they
were the saviours of the nation,âtheir exertions,
wherever they had been engaged, had turned the tide
of battle in our favour,âand, without the gallant forty-second,
the army would be like a watch without a mainspring.

How the country could have been so long the dupe
of high-sounding pretensions, I do not understand. It
could never be from the general appearance of the
corps, for of all the Highland regiments in the service,
they are the most despicable, or, to use an expressive
term,
shauchlin
, in point of appearance. Is it for their
superior discipline? all who have seen them in quarters
or in the field, know that the reverse is the fact. Was
it for their superior courage? this I deny: they have
often got into scrapes by their want of steadiness, and
when they did so, they fought desperately, no doubt, to
recover themselves; but if a man, through his own
imprudence, were to set his house on fire about his ears,
his hazarding a jump of two stories to escape the
flames, could scarcely be cried up as a very heroic
action. Trace them from their origin as a police corps
in the Highlands, through Egypt, the Peninsula, in
fact wherever they have been, and what have they
done to merit the particular distinction above every
other corps in the service, which they pretend to?
Nothingâabsolutely nothing: they are a complete
verification of the proverb, âIf you get a name of rising
early, you may lie in bed all day.â No doubt much
of the popular feeling relating to them has been revived
and cherished by certain writers, who have thrown the
charm of romance round an age distinguished by tyranny
[Pg 261]

and unrelenting barbarity on the one hand, and brutal
ignorance and superstition on the other,âwhose taste
might be questioned as much as that of a painter, who
would throw gorgeous drapery around a hideous
skeleton.

It must have confounded every person of any judgment
to see the nation carried away with this mania,
until they were dancing in masquerade, from the peer
to the half-starved mechanic, doffing their warm comfortable
breeches to sport a pair of extenuated spindle-shanks
in a kilt, and those who could not afford to buy
one, throwing a piece of tartan over their shoulders, or
wearing a bonnet filled with ostrich feathers, and
dubbing themselves Highland societies, under the name
of Celtic, &c. &c., although perhaps they never saw the
Highlands, unless at the distance of forty or fifty miles.
These things are now dying away, and, if we except
the casual appearance of some frail dandy, who has
failed to attract attention by any other means, and who
does so to put himself into the mouth of the public,
philabegs are banished to their native hills. You may
now find buckles and ostrich feathers in every brokerâs
shop, articles which, by the by, the real clansmen never
heard of until they came down to the Lowlands to see
their dress and manners caricatured; if they ever wore
feathers, they must have been crow feathers, and their
shoe-buckles, I believe, were as scarce as those for the
knee.

I have no animosity to Highlanders, as a body; there
are many brave and intelligent men amongst them, who
would disdain to seek any adventitious aid from the
mania of the day, and I willingly allow them credit for
what they deserve in common with the rest of the army;
but the behaviour of a regiment is so much influenced
by the officers, or officer, commanding, and the men
who compose it are so often changed during war or
foreign service, that a judgment formed of them at one
time would be erroneous at another. I have never
seen any difference worth observing between the courage
of English, Irish, or Scotch; and in a profession like
[Pg 262]

ours, where the natives of the three kingdoms are so
intimately mixed, any comparison of the bravery of
either country must be artificial in the extreme. The
following is a specimen of the mode in which the

gallant Highland Watch
acted towards us:â

They wore long frills to their shirts, that reached to
the first or second button of their jackets, which were
on all occasions ostentatiously drawn out; but these, in
compliance with the regulation, our regiment did not
wear. This having been remarked by the inhabitants,
they asked the reason, and the one currently alleged by
the forty-second was, âO! sheâll lose her frill for rinninâ
awaâ,â and this
lie
was propagated by them at the time
they were pretending the greatest friendship for us, and
expressing their hope that (should we go abroad) we
might be in the same division with them.

Any comparison of the merits of the two corps might
appear invidious; but I believe we had no reason to
shrink from it. Had it been the reply of an individual, it
would have been unworthy of remark; but those regiments
who have been quartered with the forty-second must
be well acquainted with their boasting illiberal manner.

Trifling as they may appear, these things certainly
produced a feeling which added to the discontent of the
people, and we could perceive, before we were many
days in the place, that our situation amongst them
would be very uncomfortable; and we had not been
long there, when one of our sentries upon the hospital
at the head of the town, had his hamstrings cut by
some person who had been lurking about his post.
Whether this proceeded from individual enmity, or a
dislike to the soldiers in general, is a thing which must
remain in doubt; but it excited a mutual animosity, and
caused strict orders to be issued to the sentinels not
to allow any person to approach within a certain distance
of their post, without coming to the charge; and
not long after, an inhabitant, the worse of liquor, passing
by one of our sentries, and disregarding the caution
given him, obstinately persisted in forcing himself upon
the sentry, and received a wound which eventually
[Pg 263]

proved mortal. Thus, new cause of hatred was produced
and kept alive, by circumstances which sprung
from a jealous feeling on either side. We very naturally
blamed the inhabitants as being the aggressors, and
referred to our conduct in Wexford, of which the inhabitants
had borne honourable testimony. The people
of Kilkenny, on the other hand, execrated us as savages
who cared nothing for human life. This feeling might
have died away, but a melancholy occurrence took place,
which kindled it anew.

In consequence of the disturbed state of the surrounding
country, the men coming in to head quarters
for the pay of the detachments, were obliged to carry
arms for their personal safety; and one of the sergeants
coming in for that purpose, accompanied by one or two
of his own men, and an inhabitant of the village where
the detachment was stationed, went into a public-house,
for the purpose of getting some refreshment. Having
sat until the liquor exerted its influence on their heads,
one of the soldiers quarreled with the inhabitant, and
they stood up to fight. The sergeant, who was naturally
hasty and choleric, rose up with the pistol which he
carried in his hand, to separate them. In the scuffle
the pistol was fired, and the inhabitant fell, mortally
wounded; the alarm was given, a crowd gathered
round the house, and the infuriated mob would have
torn the sergeant to pieces, had he not been protected
by the constables and conveyed to jail.

It was an unfortunate affair, and was made the most
of by the mob. I knew Sergeant Brody wellâperhaps
I was one of his most intimate friends; he was then
about twenty years of age. In point of duty he was
strictly correct, and much esteemed by his officers; his
education and intelligence were far beyond that commonly
possessed by soldiers, and altogether he would
have formed an agreeable companion, were it not that
his good qualities were tinged with petulance and
impatience of contradiction, arising, no doubt, from a
consciousness of his abilities, added to a temper
naturally irritable and fiery.

[Pg 264]

I happened to be on duty when the deed was done;
but next day I was admitted to see him. His mind
was overwhelmed with horror, and he pressed my
offered hand in silence, while he looked doubtfully in
my face, as if he asked, Can I expect you to feel for
me?âdo you not consider me a monster? I understood
himââI do feel for you,â said I: âI feel all the awful
exigency of your situation; but I will not forsake youâcommand
me in anything that can serve you.â

âThis is more than I expected,â he replied, âbut I
cannot now speak to you, my mind is in the most
gloomy confusion; but I hope you will come to see me
when you can.â And on my assurance that I would,
we parted.

He never entered into any particulars of the unfortunate
affair, even to me; but his feelings were too
agonising for concealment. Every indulgence was
given him consistent with his safety, which he could
expect; and being allowed to visit him, I generally saw
him every day. As the assizes approached, he summoned
up all his energy for the eventâdeath seemed a dreadful
thing, no doubt, should such be his sentence; but the
idea of a public execution was to him worse than a
thousand deaths. On this subject he often spoke to
me, and with such fearful emphasis of manner, that I
expected the horrible idea would unsettle his reason.
Some days previous to his trial, however, when I visited
him, a wonderful change seemed to have taken place
in his mind; he talked of the event with composureâevery
wild passion of his soul seemed swallowed up in
a melancholy softness; he talked of his friends, of what
the world would say of him after he was dead, and
seemed to derive pleasure from speculating on the
nature of the immortal world he thought himself on
the point of entering. Yet at times I could observe a
triumph in his eye, when he adverted to the attendant
circumstances of an execution, and he once or twice
even hazarded a jest on the subject. All this was so
utterly at variance with his former feelings, that I did
not know what to think of it. When we were parting,
[Pg 265]

I mentioned that as I was going on guard next day,
probably I would not have an opportunity of seeing
him before his trial.

âI am sorry for that,â said he, âfor I have something
important to say to you; but I may as well say it nowâDo
you see no difference in me since you saw me
last?â

âMore than I can account for,â said I.

He took my hand, and looking me earnestly in the
face, âDo you really think,â said he, âthat I have
made up my mind (if such should be my sentence) to
consign myself to the hands of the common executioner?âIf
you think so, you do not know me; they may
condemn me, but they shall never make a gazing-stock
of me. I have struggled with nature, reason, and
religion, until my brain is nearly turned. I have only
one alternative, and that I shall embrace.â We were
here interrupted by the turnkey locking up the cells;
but I needed no farther explanation of his determination.

I could not see him next day; but I determined to
write to him, and sat down when I got home for that
purpose; but what could I say? When I imagined
myself in his situation for the purpose of trying the
question, I was obliged to own that I would have
been in danger of forming the same resolution;âstill,
however, I endeavoured by every argument I was
master of, to sway him from his purpose; but when I
gave the letter next morning to a comrade, for the
purpose of conveying it to him, I felt it was of no use.

The second day after, when I got off guard, I hastened
to the court-house; his trial had commenced,âthe
house was crowded, and the greater number of the
officers of the regiment were present. The evidence
adduced proved clearly that he had fired the shot; but
no malice or forethought of the crime was established:
so far from that, the prisoner and the deceased had
been on the best terms. Several officers came forward
and gave him an excellent characterâthe Jury retired,
and during the interval, I am certain there were many
[Pg 266]

there who felt the dreadful suspense nearly as much as the
prisonerâthey again appeared, and gave in a verdict
of manslaughterâa weight was relieved from my heart,âhe
was sentenced to nine monthsâ imprisonment.
Will it be believed, that on my next seeing him he
seemed to feel disappointed? Such is the strange inconsistency
and vanity of human nature, that after
working his mind up to the pitch necessary to take
away his own life, and throwing a colouring round
the deed that had strongly excited his imagination, he
felt a kind of regret that the sacrifice was not now
necessary.

It is needless to enter more at large into his story:
he survived his imprisonment, but he could not endure
the stigma which was attached to his character. In
an evil moment he desertedâwas afterwards apprehended
and drafted to a corps stationed in the Grecian
Islands, where he soon after died, leaving an example
of the awful consequences which may proceed from
one unguarded burst of passion. Few men in the
regiment had better prospectsâa common mind might
have regained in a great measure its equilibrium; but
how often is it the case, that when a mind of sensibility
and genius errs, âit falls, like Lucifer, never to rise
again.â

CHAPTER X.

DETACHMENT.

In the course of duty, I was one of a detachment sent
to a village about twenty miles from head-quarters,
where the inhabitants were in a disturbed state. From
the accounts given us by the constables when we first
went there, we were led to believe that the whole
country was in arms, ready, when the word was given,
to massacre all opposed to their schemes. But we
soon found that their fears or their prejudices had
magnified the cause of alarm to a wonderful degree.
Before we became acquainted with the true state of
[Pg 267]

affairs, they made us complete hacks, calling us out to
their assistance in every drunken squabble which took
place, often through their own insolent behaviour.

I remember one night we were turned out in a great
hurry by one of the constables, who rode up to our
barrack, with his horse sweating and his face pale with
terror. He had laid off a dreadful story of his coming
home from the fair of Tââ, and on the top of a hill,
about two miles from the town, he had unexpectedly
come upon about two hundred Shanavests in a field,
holding one of their nocturnal meetings, who, when
they saw him, shouted out and fired half-a-dozen shots
at him; that he, seeing it of no use to face so many,
set spurs to his horse and fled, followed by a whole
troop of them, to the very end of the village.

Having turned out, we set off at a double quick
pace towards the scene of action; on reaching the foot
of the hill, where he said the boys were assembled, we
loaded, fixed our bayonets, and were gallantly led up
to the attack by the constable himself.

âEasy, easy boys,â said he, âweâll be on them in a
jiffyâdonât fire till I give you the word, and youâll see
weâll surround them and take them all prisoners.â So
saying, he crept softly on some way in front. The
night was very dark, and we could see nothing distinctly;
but when within about fifty yards of the top
of the hill, we were startled by a tremendous clatter of
feet upon the stones of the road, followed by the cry of
âMurder, murder! Fire, fire!â We had not been
accustomed to waste our ammunition uselessly, and
waited a second or two to see what we had to fire at;
but one of our party (a recruit) snapt his musket on
the alarm; luckily for the constable, it missed fire, for
it was directed at him as the only object that could be
seen. In less time, however, than I could relate it, the
cause of our alarm rushed past in the shape of a horse,
that had sprung from the field upon the road as we
advanced. Having reached the spot pointed out by
the constable, nothing could be seen but a few heifers
grazing about, quite unconscious of having disturbed the
[Pg 268]

peace. We certainly did not feel well pleased at being
turned out at such an unseasonable hour to no purpose,
and we taxed the constable roundly with imagining
the whole story, but he swore by all that was good,
that every word of what he told was truth. Next
morning, however, we were convinced that our surmises
were correct, for on inspecting the field where
the Shanavests were said to be assembled, not a single
foot-mark could be seen, although the ground was
moist from previous rain; besides, it was well known
that the constable had taken a sup too much at the
fair, for when he left it he was scarcely able to sit his
horse.

For some time we were regularly called out by these
fellows, when they went to distrain a manâs goods for
rent or tithes, until we were more like the bailiffâs body-guard
than anything else. But after being made fools
of in this way two or three times, our officer remonstrated,
and arranged matters so, that we were not
obliged to go out without a special order from the
magistrate. This relieved us from the petty affairs
more immediately under the cognizance of the constable;
but still we had enough to do in following the
magistrate, who seemed to consider a hunt after his
countrymen even more amusing than one after the fox.
Had the people been peaceably inclined, his conduct
would have goaded them on to outrage. He was continually
up to the ears in businessâsome momentous
matter always on hand. Every trifling riot was
magnified into a deep-laid rebellionâif a cabin or a
hay stack was set on fire, a whole village was burnedâif
one man was wounded, a dozen were killed; and
so on, always magnifying the event in proportion to
the distance. His conduct put me in mind of those
amateurs, who when they want to bait a bull, aggravate
it to the necessary pitch to create them sufficient
sport, and then allege its madness as a pretext for treating
it cruelly.

On the other hand, there were magistrates, who,
going to the opposite extreme, rendered themselves
[Pg 269]

useless to the country. One of this description lived
near us, and from having no strength of mind, or reliance
on his own judgment, was alternately the slave of
either party, repealing now, what he had enacted beforeâordering
men to be apprehended one day as criminals,
and on being threatened by their party, releasing them
the next,âhe was despised by all, and trusted by none.
There were not wanting magistrates who, to an active
and effective execution of their duty, added discrimination
and a conciliatory spirit; but I am sorry to say
that their efforts were often neutralized by the blundering,
hot-headed zeal, or the timid inanity of their
colleagues in office.

Although the alarmists made the most of every
trifling circumstance that occurred, yet it cannot be
denied that some very barbarous actions were committed
by the associated bands of Shanavests and
Caravats, always directed, however, against individuals
who showed themselves forward in oppressing them,
or who took the land at a rack-rent over their heads.
Nothing could be more absurd than to say they had
any regular political aim in view. In their combination,
the two parties seemed to have a jealousy of each
other, and often fell out at their hurling matches,
and beat each other soundly; and there were a good
many spies among them in pay of the magistracy, who
gave information of all their proceedings. While we
were there, they had a quantity of arms, which they
had forcibly taken from people in the neighbourhood
who, being loyalists, were authorized to keep them. A
smith belonging to the faction kept them in repair, but
when payment came to be asked for his trouble, instead
of money they gave him a âgood lickingâ for his presumption.
Barny did not like this mode of clearing
scores, and, to be revenged, gave in a list of the names
of all who had arms in their possession to the magistrate.
This list was stuck up at the cross-roads, along
with a summons, to deliver them up, or stand the consequence.
Some did comply, but the greater number
evaded the order by secreting them. Barny, however,
[Pg 270]

would not let them slip that way: he conducted us to
an old drain, where we found upwards of forty stand
of blunderbusses, fowling-pieces, and pistols; but two-thirds
of them were so much out of repair that it
would have been dangerous to use them. Poor Barny,
from the time he had lodged the information, was
obliged to take up his quarters with us, and eventually
had to bid âhis native land good-nightâ for his share
in the business, and I dare say did not venture back
in a hurry.

In general their aim was revenge, not plunder; but
a few of the most hardened and daring of them were
regular robbers and house-breakersâa gang of six or
seven of whom were apprehended while I was there,
and sent into jail. At the ensuing assizes they were
tried; one or two got off through want of evidence, and
others were transported for life. I happened to be present
when the trial of one of them came on, who, from
his activity and forwardness in their depredations, was
considered a ringleader. If I recollect right, there was
some murder connected with the robbery with which
he was charged. I do not now remember the exact
particulars of his trial, but I cannot forget the boldness
and audacity of his conduct while at the bar. Evidence
after evidence was examined, and although there was
much circumstantial proof of his guilt, yet there seemed
to be a connecting link wanting, without which it must
fall to the ground. One evidence (a woman) had been
repeatedly called, but she did not appear; and the eye
of the prisoner beamed triumph and defiance. The
public prosecutor stood up to close his case.

âHe was compelled to own,â he said, âthat it had
been but imperfectly made out, and he would therefore
not troubleââAt this moment a bustle was heard in
the court.

âMake way for the witness,â said the crier, and she
stood before them. All were surprised; but I cannot
convey an idea of the effect her appearance had upon
the prisoner; he stood as if turned into stone, his face
grew deadly pale, and he reeled back from the bar,
[Pg 271]

while, with a convulsive fetch of his breath, he
uttered, âI am sold.â She went on with her evidence;
it was clear and conclusive, and filled up every blank.
The prisoner had recovered himself, and stood listening
to her story with his livid lips strongly compressed, his
hands clenched, and the cold sweat standing on his
forehead. When she concluded, he caught her eye as
she turned to descend from the table, and gave her a
withering look, full of deadly revenge, and summoning
up his remaining energy for the effort, he uttered a
curse upon her, with an emphasis worthy of a demon,
and sunk back in the dock. He was sentenced to death.

There is little time allowed in Ireland between sentence
and execution, and this he employed in steeling
his mind to every feeling. On the morning of his execution,
his relations from the country were admitted to
see him; they had drank whisky before they came in,
to drown their grief, and a scene took place between
them and the dying man, which, were I to attempt to
draw in the ludicrous light it was presented, would not
be credited. The drop was in front of the jail, and his
relations accompanied him to the foot of the stairs he
had to ascend: as they parted with him, âHere, Murthy,â
said he, shuffling off his shoes, âtake themâno
hangman rascal shall get my shoes.â

His friends now came to the front of the jail, and
were allowed to remain on the green plot, between the
soldiers and the drop. When the unfortunate man approached
the door, from which he was to plunge into
another world, he pushed hurriedly forward, with the
intention of addressing the multitude; but he was
drawn back until the rope was placed about his neck,
which being done, he advanced boldly to the edge of
the platform, and in the face of the clearest evidence of
his guilt, and former abandoned course of life, he cried
out to the spectators, âI am innocent of the crime for
which I suffer.â

A murmur burst from the crowd, responsive of their
belief in his asseveration, when one of his half-intoxicated
relatives cried out,â

[Pg 272]

âAh, poor Andy, and his shoes off too!â and sunk
down upon the grass, but immediately rising and raising
his arm, he cried out to the unfortunate wretch, who
was now standing on the fatal dropââDie hard, AndyâAndy,
jewel, die like a man.â

The next moment, Andy spurned the handkerchief
indignantly from his hand, and was launched into
eternity amid the prayers of the surrounding multitude,
who, I have no doubt, considered him a martyr to the
vindictive spirit of the laws.

CHAPTER XI.

EUGENE MâCARTHY.

While on detachment at this place, I became acquainted
with Eugene MâCarthy, a young man, whose education
and intelligence far exceeded the generality of
the people in the village. He was the most liberal-minded
Catholic I ever met with; his views of the
world and its manners were clear and unprejudiced,
and to him I am principally indebted for what I know
of the real state of Ireland; for party-spirit exists to
such an extent, that it is almost impossible for a stranger
to learn anything of it, unless through some prejudiced
and distorted medium. There was something congenial
in our habits and pursuits, which led us to associate;
and in answer to the question from me, how he had
managed to cultivate his mind more than the rest of his
neighbours? he gave me the following history of his life.

âMy father possessed a farm of 100 acres, about
five miles from this, which we still hold. My mother
and two sisters, one older, and the other younger than
me, composed his family. Being active and industrious,
he managed his little estate in such a way that we were
enabled to live comfortably and respectably. He was
a man of strong sound sense, though in point of education
not much above the common, his attention being
more turned towards the improvement of his farm than
[Pg 273]

his mind, but he was very anxious that his children
should be well informed. Our village school was none
of the best, and had it not been for my mother, we
would have made little improvement. She was a native
of Dublin, where she had received an excellent education,
and having a natural taste for literature, she found
little pleasure in associating with her neighboursâthus
concentrating all her pleasures in her little family. She
led us to the source from which she had derived so
much pleasure, and early imbued our minds with a
thirst for knowledge, which she took care to gratify by
every means in her power. But her system of teaching
was not that of the schools, unless in learning to read:
we had no formal tasksâher book was nature, which
she first led us to admire, then to examine, and when
our curiosity was raised, she drew speech from stones,
sermons from brooks, and good from every thing. The
phenomena of nature, as they occurred, furnished subjects
for explanation and illustration. The growth and
construction of a flowerâthe change of seasonsâthe
succession of day and nightâthe thunder, whirlwind,
and tempest,âwere all pressed into her service; and
when our young imaginations were excited, she seized
the important moment to impress their nature and use
on our minds. Thus we were every moment insensibly
acquiring knowledge, not by formal study, or by being
pent up in a room, poring over a book for six or eight
hours a-day, getting question and answer by rote like a
parrot, but by our judgments being brought into action.
Books, however, were not excluded: when our curiosity
was once excited, and we felt inclined to acquire more
information on any subject, we were referred to those
which contained it, and by its being made the theme of
a subsequent conversation, our doubts were solved, and
our perplexities removed. The filial affection which
this mode of education cherished, I shall feel to my
latest breath. Her instructions were the pleasure of
our lives, the withholding them the greatest punishment.
We looked up to her as our guide, our comforter,
and friend on all occasions.

[Pg 274]

âOne day I was questioning her with childish simplicity
about the horizon, and the form of our earth, as
they had been the subject of some of my reveries; and
never shall I forget the flood of delight that flowed in
upon my soul, when, with the ball I was playing with,
suspended from a thread, she conveyed to my mind an
idea of its form and motion. In morality her system
was much the same; after having taught us its general
principles, she left us to the freedom of our own will.
She used to say such and such consequences attend on
our good and evil actions, your minds will tell you
which are most conducive to your happiness; thus,
when we committed an error, she did not endeavour to
avert the consequences, but seized on that opportunity
to describe the pleasure a contrary conduct would have
afforded. Her pious exhortations, however, were never
formal, she watched the favourable moment for making
an impression, when our hearts were uplifted by some
unexpected good, or lighted up with pleasure from the
appearance of nature; she then led us up to natureâs
God, and expatiated on the wonders of his power, and
attributes, until we spontaneously bowed in wonder
and adoration. She is a Catholic, but not a bigoted
oneâshe does not believe that other sects will be damned,
if their hearts are sincere, and their actions good;
and although she is regular in the duties of her church,
she does not substitute them for the more important
ones of mercy and justice. Under the guidance of
such a mother, is it to be wondered at, that I am better
informed than our neighbours?

âHowever, my education did not rest here. From
my earliest years, I was destined by my father for the
church, in accordance with a foolish vanity prevalent
in Ireland, which induces parents often to bring up
some favourite son for the priesthood, to the injury of
the rest of the family; and it is remarkable with what
fond delusion they rely upon this individual for both
worldly and spiritual benefits: the child so set aside is
treated with as much deference as if he were already
in office, and his brothers and sisters are slaved to
[Pg 275]

procure the means for his subsistence, as a gentleman
at college.

âMy mother did not take the same view of the
subject as my father; she thought there was no want
of priests, and she considered that I might be as good
a man, and as useful to society, in some other situation
of life; but her objections were overruled by my father,
who was determined in his purpose.

âFrom a preparatory school about forty miles from
this, I was sent to Maynooth College, where I had been
about two years, when I was summoned home, in consequence
of my fatherâs illness, and arrived only in time
to witness his last moments. My mother was in great
distress of mind, and urged me strongly to give up my
studies, and remain at home; but I needed little
solicitation, for I had no taste for the life of a priest.
I had been too early taught the sympathies, charities, and
pleasures of domestic life, to prefer celibacy and seclusion
in their stead; so I left college and settled at home.

âI have been residing in town for these two months
back, in consequence of my uncleâs absence in England,
whose business I have to look after; but I expect him
home in a few days, when, I trust, you will accompany
me to see our little farm, when I will introduce you to
her whom I have been describing, and I am sure you
will say that I have not done more than justice to her
character.â

Accordingly, when Eugene was relieved from his
trust, I accompanied him out to Bââ. At the foot
of a small avenue of trees, leading up to his house, we
were met by a large Newfoundland dog, who came
bounding down to meet his master, followed by Billy
MâDaniel, who was a kind of
fac totum
on the farm.

âWelcome home, master! Are you come for good
and all to us? Itâs the mistress, and Miss Mary, and
Catherine, that will be glad to see you. Your servant,
sir,â turning about to meââGet down, CÃ¦sar, and
donât be dirtying the gentlemanâs clothes; but heâs so
proud to see yees all, that he doesnât know what to
make of himself.â

[Pg 276]

âWell, Billy,â said Eugene, âhowâs the hay getting
on?â

âMighty well, sir, never better; we finished the low
meadow this morning.â

We had now reached the lawn in front of the
cottage, where we were met by his mother, âWelcome,
child,â said she; âis your uncle come home, or is this
only a visit?â

âMy uncle arrived yesterday; but he is still so busy
that he will not be able to get out to see you until
next weekâGive me leave to introduce you to a friend
of mine, whom I have brought out to see how the

wild Irish
grow in the countryâhe has had a specimen
of it in the village.â

âAny friend of Eugeneâs is always welcome to me,â
said she, âbut a soldier in particular; my favourite
brother belonged to that profession; he was an officer
in the eighty-eighth regiment; but, alas! he is now
no more: he fell at the battle of Talavera. Was your
regiment in Spain?â

âYes,â replied I, âbut it had not arrived in the
Peninsula when the battle of Talavera was fought.â

âCome, mother,â said Eugene, seeing the tear standing
in her eye, âLet us drop all conversation about
âwarâs alarmsâ nowâHave you got anything for us
to eat? remember we have had a brisk walk. Whereâs
Mary and Catherine?â

âThey are out in the garden weeding,â said she, âbut
when they hear you have returned, they will not stop
long.â

She had scarcely done speaking, when in bounced a
sprightly girl about fourteen years of age, and throwing
her arms about his neck, âYou are welcome back,
Eugene,â said she, âweâve been pining the life out of
us since you left home; but you are going to stay now,
are you not?â

The elder girl now came in, and advancing without
any affected reserve, shook my proffered hand warmly,
and welcomed me as the friend of her brother. The
Irish infuse their soul and spirit into every thing they
[Pg 277]

do, and nothing can be warmer than their welcome;
they set your mind at ease in a moment, and convince
you so strongly that they are in earnest in their professions,
that you feel yourself like one of themselves,
before you are half-an-hour in their company. After
we had got some refreshment, we were joined by the
family, who had now completed the labours of the
day, and I had an opportunity of observing the character
of each.

Mrs MâCarthy might then be about forty years of
age: she was still a fine-looking woman, although the
traces of time and care were beginning to show themselves
in her countenanceâthe rose had fled her cheek;
but there was an eloquent expression in her eye at once
mild and commanding, that kept pace with the varied
emotions of her soul, and a dignity in her manner
which bespoke a mind conscious of its own powers.

Catherine was a Hebe blushing with health and
spirit, sporting in the morning beam of life, without
a thought or care to disturb her happy frame of mind.
But Mary had more of the collected sedateness of
womanhood in her manner: she might then be about
one or two and twenty; her person in height was
above the middle size, but exquisitely formed; and
her glossy black hair fell in natural ringlets about
a face, which, although it could not be called regularly
beautiful, had so much soul in it, that even at first
sight you could not behold it with indifference; but
when her dark eyes were lighted up with feeling,
whether âshining through sorrowâs stream,â or flashing
with enthusiasm, the effect was alike irresistible,âand
she was an enthusiast in every thing belonging to
Ireland. She prided herself on the national character,
vindicated its weaknesses and follies, and dropped a
tear oâer its misery.

âThe poor Irish are called degraded and wicked,â
said she, âby those who exert all their influence to
make them so; but relax the iron grasp that holds
them to the earth, let them be instructed, and you will
see what they will become. Where they have had an
[Pg 278]

opportunity, have they not signalized themselves in
every department? Where will you find poets, orators,
warriors, and statesmen like them?â

âMy sister is an enthusiast in every thing Irish,â
said Eugene; âbut after all there are exceptions to her
rule,âwe have had Irish statesmen who betrayed their
country, Irish warriors who were no heroes, and poets
who never drank of the Castalian fount.â

âOh! I do not go to such an extravagant length as
to take in all; but look at the names that fame has
written in golden letters on her annals.â

âHave we not a Wellington, a Grattan, a Sheridan,
and a Castââ?â said Eugene.

âName him not,â said she hastily, putting her hand
on his mouth.

âAt present,â said Mrs MâCarthy, âwe see all his
actions through the haze of prejudiceâposterity will
judge better of his character, and say whether he
deserves the odium which has been cast upon it.â

âBy the by, you served with our countryman,
Wellington, whose fame has sounded through the world,âwhat
character does he hold among the soldiers?â

âThat is a question I am scarcely prepared to
answer; but I will give you my own opinion, which
may after all be nearly the sense of the army on the
subject. I admit that he has many of the qualities
which constitute a great general, such as valour, prudence,
discrimination, &c., but there is one which, in
my opinion, he fell short of.â

âIndeed!â said Mrs MâCarthy, âwhat is it?â

âHe had not the art of gaining the menâs affections,âhe
never identified himself with his army, and being
either above or below human sympathy, he was the
same cold, stern individual when they performed feats
of valour as when they committed faults. In short, he
was a being removed from all our associations, who
might be admired at a distance, feared or respected on
the spot; but never loved.â

âYou seem determined to put me out of conceit with
my countrymen,â said Mary; âI need not speak of
[Pg 279]

Moore, our great national poet, you will have some
drawback on his fame also.â

âHe has been accused,â said Mrs MâCarthy, âof
loose and voluptuous sentiment. I can say nothing of
the minor poems, said to be his, for I never read them;
but in reading his Lalla Rookh, and his Irish Melodies,
I have caught a portion of the inspiration and enthusiasm
which he must have possessed when writing
them.â

âHis own apology for his venal errors,â said Mary,
âwho can withstand!â

Then blame not the bard if in pleasureâs soft dream,

He should try to forget what he never can heal:

Oh! give but a hopeâlet a vista but gleam

Through the gloom of his country, and mark how heâll feel!

That instant his heart at her shrine would lay down

Every passion it nursed, every bliss it adored, &c.

âWhatever may be his faults, his deep and fervent
love of country, his enthusiasm in the cause of liberty,
and the magic strains in which he âpours the full tide
of a patriotâs song,â must endear him to every Irish
heartâmust endear him to the world.â

âIâm afraid my sister will make an Irishman of you,
before you leave us,â said Eugene.

âOn that subject her opinion is mine,â said I, âand
I am sure it would be no ordinary gratification to
Thomas Moore, to hear his praise poured forth so
eloquently from the lips of a fair countrywoman. The
works of Moore and Byron excite my feelings in reading
them, more than those of any modern poet; different
in their style, yet each in that style excelling all others.
I cannot find a better simile to express my opinion of
their powers, than one drawn from the fairy legend of
OâDonoghue. The poetry of Moore may be compared
to the band of youths and maidens who skim over the
lake, to the sound of heavenly music, scattering flowers
on every side,âthat of Byron to the spectre chief, who,
mounted on his resistless spirit-horse, prances through
the foam-crested waves.â

âWell,â said Eugene, âI suppose you have heard
[Pg 280]

enough of Ireland for one night; we may as well retire
to rest, for we rise earlier here than you do in town.
This is a busy time with us, and we must be all at
work by four in the morning.â

âAt work,â said I, âso early?â

âYes,â said Eugene, âfor although we generally
spend our evenings in this manner, we find it necessary
to assist in the labours of the farm during the day.
Many of the higher class of society laugh at the idea of
individuals who earn their bread by manual labour,
possessing refined taste or imagination; they consider
it as incongruous and unnatural. Not content with
engrossing all the pleasures of sense, they seek to rob
them of those which a cultivated mind afford; and any
attempt of their poorer brethren to soar into the regions
of science or imagination, is met by them with the
most supercilious contempt and sneering ridicule. The
novel writers of our day have contributed much towards
this false and unjust association,âall their
dramatis
personÃ¦
are dukes, lords, and squires, rich as CrÅsus,
with nothing to do but gad about the country. In
proportion to the mental powers, intellectual cultivation
has the same effect upon the poor man and the rich,âthe
want of it equally debases them. But knowledge
does not altogether depend on going through a certain
routine of education. The man of keen observation,
who has his eyes and ears open, and compares and
draws conclusions from all that comes within his
notice, who thinks for himself, and reasons fearlessly
on all subjects, that man will gain knowledge under
very unfavourable circumstances.â

When I got up next morning, I found them all a-field
working at the hay. It was a beautiful morning, and
Eugene conducted me round his little estate, which was
finely situated, compact, and advantageously laid out.
The cottage lay on the top of a small rise in the centre
of the farm; before it was a lawn of about an acre,
skirted on each side by trees, beyond which lay his
pasture ground and meadows, divided from the adjoining
farm by a stream, whose margin was fringed with the
[Pg 281]

birch, the hazel, and the willow. Behind the cottage
was his orchard and garden; the house itself consisted
of one story, with what is commonly called the loft,
formed into bed-rooms, the windows being raised in the
neatly-thatched roof; outside it was dashed and white-washed,
and around the door and windows was trained
a profusion of honeysuckle, whose flowers shed a
delightful fragrance through every apartment. The
interior corresponded with its appearance outside;
without any gaudy superfluity there was every thing
conducive to comfort, and the greatest regularity and
neatness was apparent throughout the whole. But all
this was nothing to the pure affection that reigned in
the bosom of its inmates towards each other. Whatever
trouble Eugeneâs mother might have had with her
family when young, she was now richly repaid; they
hung on every word she said as if it were the precepts
of an angelâthey anticipated every wish, shunned
every subject which would cause her disquiet, while
she treated them with all the affection of a mother and
all the confidence of a friend.

The surrounding commotions touched them not.
Mrs MâCarthy was almost adored among her neighbours
for her benevolence, and, what they termed, her
true
Irish spirit
; and Eugene, though a young man, had
more influence over the members of the lawless associations
in his neighbourhood than almost any individual
in the county, which he never failed to exert on all
occasions when it was in his power to prevent their
atrocities.

After breakfast,ââCome,â said Eugene, âas I have
nothing very particular to do, I will conduct you over
the classic ground in the neighbourhood, and as Mary
possesses the
amor patria
in so eminent a degree, she
will accompany us, and describe all its beauties, lay
open the arcana of every fairy mount, read you long
lectures on the
good people
, their midnight gambols and
mischievous freaks; show you the stream over which
the
Banshee
raises her ominous howl, as a prelude to
the death of a MâCarthy, or describe the form and
[Pg 282]

properties of
Cluricaunes
,
Phookas
,
Fetches
, &c. &c., for
she is deeply learned in fairy lore.â

âNever mind him,â said Mary, âfew people delight
more in hearing these fairy legends than Eugene
himself.â

Having set out on our ramble, about a mile from the
house, near a small village, (if a few cottar houses
deserved the name,) we passed a well, over which hung
a bush covered with white linen rags. Having expressed
my surprise at such an unusual thing, âThis is
one of our holy wells,â said Mary, âto which the country
people resort, who are troubled with sore eyes, each
bringing a linen rag to wash them, and leaving it as an
oblation, hanging on the bush.â

On reaching the houses, Eugene stopped us in front
of one, the roof of which had fallen in.

CHAPTER XII.

THE VILLAGE SCHOOL.

âThis is all that remains of our village school. Here,
in his noisy mansion, sat Phil. Sullivan, wielding his
birch as if it had been a sceptre, while his little subjects
were ranged around on benches formed of sods, that
you may still see along the wall. The fire, when any
was required, was made in the centre of the apartment,
the fuel being furnished by each scholar daily bringing
a turf with him. The door was formed of stakes
interlaced with
wattles
, a loop of which thrown over a
crooked nail served the purpose of a lock, and a rude
table that the master sat at was all the desk in his
school. As they came in at the door, the urchins were
obliged to make their best bow, by drawing back the
left leg, catching the tuft of hair that hung over the
forehead, and bringing their stiff necks to the precise
mathematical curve that constituted politeness; while
Phil. sat in the middle, sometimes talking English,
sometimes Irish, to suit himself to the comprehension
[Pg 283]

of his pupils. As a specimen of the manner in which
he accomplished this, I will give you a journal of my
first day at school.

âWhile the more advanced scholars were conning
their tasks, he taught the younger tyros the alphabetââCome
up here, Pat Geehan,â said he to a red-headed
boy, dressed in a grey frieze coat, which came down to
his heels, and a pair of old leather breeches, that, only
reaching half-way down his thighs, exposed his red
measled legs,ââCome, stand up here on the table, and
let the boys hear how well you can say your letters.ââPat
mounted with great confidence; but when his
phiz, by being raised into the light, became more distinctly
seen, âUbbaboo, tearinâ murder!â exclaimed Phil.,
âwhere have you been wid that face? why, man alive,
youâve been kissing the prata pot; and your hair, too,
stanninâ up for a price, like the bristles of a fighting
pig. Is there no water in the stream? and it would
have been no great trouble to draw your fingers through
your hair any how.ââPat very composedly lifted up
the tail of his coat, and, spitting upon it, gave his face
a wipe that left it streaked like a branded cowââThere
now,â said Phil., âblow your nose, and hold up your
head like a gentleman. Whatâs this, avick?â said he,
pointing to the first letter of the alphabetâPat scratched
his headââYou donât know what it is?âsmall blame
to you, for your mother keeps you running after the
cows, when you should be at your larninâ; but look up
at the couples of the house, and try if you canât remember
it.âââA,â said Pat.ââWell done! Whatâs
the name of the next one?â Pat hesitated again.ââWhat
do you call the big fly that makes the honey?âââB.âââOch
youâre a genus, Pat, ready made.â So on
he went illustrating in this manner, until he came to
the letter O. Having tried Patâs âgenusâ with it two or
three ways to no purpose, Phil. was getting out of
patienceââWhat would you say if I was to hit you a
palthog on the ear?â (suiting the action to the word,)ââO!â
cried Pat, clapping his hand upon the afflicted spot,
which rung with the blow.ââI knew you would find it,â
[Pg 284]

said Phil.âBy the help of this admonition Pat struggled
through the rest of the letters,ââWell, you may sit
down now, and send up Mick Moriarty.ââMick was
rather farther on than Patâhe was spelling words.
After spelling two or three tolerably well, he came to
the word âwhatâââWell, what does w-h-a-t make?ââMick
was not sure about itââW-h-a-t,â said Phil.,
âsounds
fat
; but,â (conscious of his own error in the
pronunciation) âwhen I say fat, donât you say fat; but
do you say fat your own way.ââ

âEugene is caricaturing,â said Mary, âPhil. Sullivan
was scarcely so bad as he represents; although I must
confess his mode of instruction was at times rather ludicrous.
Yet it was perhaps better suited to the poor
children he had to teach, than that of a more refined
instructor; and for all his blundering at the English,
there was not one in the county a match for him at
Latin or Irish.â

âThat is certainly true,â said Eugene, âit was from
him I learned the rudiments of Latin, and he has
taught it to half the cow-boys in the parish, to keep
them, as he said himself, out oâ longinâ. This may
account in some measure for the acquaintance with
Heathen Mythology, which some of our most ignorant
poetasters possess, and which is so profusely and sometimes
ridiculously made use of in our songs. I do not
mean those blundering songs misnamed Irish, that are
written by blockheads as utterly ignorant of the idiom
of our language, as they appear to be of common sense;
but in songs which, though little known out of Ireland,
must be familiar to all who have been any time in the
country,âsuch as the following:âA young man meets
a pretty girl in a morning, and falling head and ears
in love with her at first sight, he breaks out with this
rhapsody:â

Are you Aurora or the goddess Flora?

Or are you Venus or the morning sun? &c.

âPoor Phil. Sullivan is now no more, and those who
once composed his school are dispersed to the four
quarters of the globeâa new parish school-house is
[Pg 285]

built, but few attend it, in consequence of some attempt
made to interfere with the belief of the children.â

When we left the school-house, we were met by a
sedate-looking old gentleman, who saluted us as he
passed. âThat,â said Eugene, âis Father ââ, our
parish priest, a good and upright man; but eccentric
in his manners, and more so in his preachingâthat the
latter is affected for the purpose of accommodating
himself to the comprehension of his hearers, I believe,
for he is a man of learning, and shines in conversation,
when in company with people who understand him;
but if you heard him from the pulpit, I doubt much
whether you would be able to refrain from laughing.

âWhen the congregation are all composed, with
their eyes fixed on him, he begins: âThere you are all
of ye, looking demure and mim-mouthed, like as many
saints, as if butter wouldnât melt in your mouths. Who
would think, now, that half-an-hour ago you were busy
scandalizing one another, making your remarks on this
oneâs dress, and that oneâs face, while more of ye were
bargaining about your pratas and corn; and this is all
done when you come here on the pretence of hearing
the word of God on the Lordâs-day; but what do you
do on the week-days?âwhy, you curse, and swear, and
tell lies, and drink, and fight; and worse than all that,
you go scheming about at night, doing mischief to every
one that doesnât please you; and after doing all this,
youâll come to me, hanging a lip like a motherless foal,
and a whine in your face, to make your confession, and
get absolution for your sins. But how can I give you
absolution? people that never think of God, only when
the devilâs at their elbowâAnd when I refuse ye, ye
fall to blubbering, and say, O Father ââ dear! hear
me; what will I do, if you donât hear me? And what
answer can I make ye, only that youâll go to hell and
be damnedâand indeed itâs as true as I say it, if you
donât mend your manners, that will be the end of ye.
So I would advise you to mind what youâre about, and
donât forget that thereâs One above ye, thatâs taking
note of all your misdeeds. I am sure you know yourselves
[Pg 286]

thereâs no pleasure in the world in doing whatâs
wrong, and you all know how contented you feel when
you do whatâs right. Then take my advice, and âmake
your soulsâ without any delay, for the Lord knows
which of you may be alive to see next Sunday.â

âThat is but a very imperfect specimen of his powers;
for, in this rude style, he is a most merciless dissector
of the human heart, and his hearers often wonder how
he attains a knowledge of their most secret failings,
even when they are not regular in their duty. Rude,
however, as his oratory is, at times it is very impressive,
and I have often seen his audience in tears. He possesses
a strong influence over his flock, and I have frequently
seen him plunge into the midst of an hundred
fellows who were fighting with sticks, and with his
horse-whip disperse the whole of them.

âThere is a very unjust prejudice raised against our
clergymen, from the supposition that they encourage or
abet the disturbances that agitate this country. Nothing
can be more unjust: they not only denounce and
excommunicate all concerned in them, from the pulpit,
but I have known them risk their lives in the endeavour
to prevent outrages. I am sure, take them as
a body, that there is not a more useful or exemplary
set of men in the world, than the parish priests of
Ireland. There are, no doubt, exceptions; but what
would become of the character of the clergymen of the
Established Church, were individual instances brought
forward to criminate the whole body? For my part,
although I am a Catholic, and of course must condemn
the upholding an expensive church establishment at the
charge of people who are not members of it, yet there
are many clergymen of that church whom I esteem
and respect. With the one belonging to our parish we
are on the most friendly terms; his family and ours
are almost constantly together, and I am sure love each
other sincerely. It would be well for you to bear in
mind, that in this country
Protestant
and
Catholic
is not
so much the distinguishing name of a religious sect, as
it is the
shibboleth
of a political faction. There is, indeed,
[Pg 287]

very little religion among the zealots on either
side,âtheir own aggrandisement, and the possession of
power or popularity, being their ruling motive. Poor
Ireland has been torn to pieces between these conflicting
parties, and has alternately been the dupe or the
victim of the one or the other. Among well-informed
and really religious people, these distinctions are little
thought of.â

âNor should they be,â replied I; âbut, in my
opinion, the influence of your clergymen over the mind
and conscience of their flock extends too far, when used
among ignorant and debased people. To restrain them
from what is wrong, it may be beneficial, but it can
also be turned to a bad purpose; and few intelligent
people would like to have their conscience so much in
the keeping of men frail and erring in their nature.â

âTheir influence is not so great as you imagine,â replied
Eugene; âwe exercise a freedom of opinion on
many points; for instance, there are many Catholics
who cannot believe that all other sects will be eternally
lost, and the enlightened of our clergy do not insist
upon the point.â

âIt is an article of belief,â said I, âthat in my
opinion is replete with mischief, and is the strongest
weapon in the hands of your adversaries against emancipation.
What can we expect, say they, from people
who believe we are running the broad road to destruction?
Even their pity can only extend so far as to
drag us from its brink forcibly, as we would restrain a
man from committing suicide. Would there not be an
end of our political and religious freedom, the moment
they got the ascendancy?â

âIt is certainly the most feasible argument they use,â
replied Eugene; âbut at most we could not treat you
worse than we have been treated, and if knowledge, by
enlarging the mind, creates a more liberal feeling, its
effects will extend to the poor Catholics as well as
others. It is, after all, but a puerile argument; we
find Protestants tolerated in France, and other Catholic
countries. The evil you dread springs from ignorance,
[Pg 288]

which produces bigotry, intolerance, and persecution,
among Protestants as well as Catholics.âBut I am
sure you must be teazed with our incessantly talking
about our country?â

âFar from it,â said I, âthe subject to me is very interesting.â

âFor once,â said Mary, âI am tired of it; let us shift
the subject, if you please, to something else.â

âThen I hope you will conduct us to the fairy haunts
in the neighbourhood, and give us some of the traditions
about them.â

âWith all my heart,â said she; âbut we do not need
to travel farâthis green mount on our left is said to
be a favourite resort of the âgood people,â and as its
summit commands a view of all the places of note in the
neighbourhood, we may seat ourselves there.â So saying,
she led the way.
[19]

As we were returning home,ââI see you are like
the rest of your countrymen,â said she, âa good listener;
but you take care that we shall not know much of your
adventures. You, that have been ranging the world
over, amid scenes of every kind, must surely have much
more interesting subjects in store, than those who have
been always at home.â

âThe life of a soldier is not so varied,â said I, âas
you may imagine; there is a sameness in his duty, and
so little liberty of his own in all that he does, that he
cannot see or feel objects through the same medium as
those who travel on pleasure or business. In general,
he is secluded in a barrack or a camp from the rest of
the world, and therefore there can be little variation in
his life at home or abroad. In war, he is placed in
[Pg 289]

circumstances which often strongly excite his mind,
but the repetition of even these, soon renders it incapable
of the impression. When we had been some
time abroad, we went into action with nearly as much
indifference as we did any minor point of duty.â

âThen we are led to believe, from what you say, that
soldiers are thus rendered incapable of the finer feelings
of humanity.â

âUnder particular circumstances it may have that
effect,â said I, âBut, after all, there is no class of men
so susceptible of feeling, if the proper chord is touched.
I know many instances of their disinterested and generous
conduct in assisting the distressed; and the story
which I am going to relate may exemplify the manner
in which their sensibilities may be wrought upon, even
in the tumult and excitation of an assault, where, in
general, the kindly feelings of nature are entirely excluded.

âThe adventure is not one of my own, but it was
related to me by my friend Hââ, whom you have
heard me mention, and whose veracity I cannot question.â

FOOTNOTES:

[19]
Here I had introduced some fairy traditions, which she recited
with all the arch and witty accompaniments of voice and manner,
which render even a common story interesting; but having accidentally
met with a very entertaining book lately published, entitled,
âFairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland,â where I
find similar stories, related in a style so much superior to mine, that
it would have been presumption in me to follow the same track; I
have thought it proper to cancel that part of my MS. and must now
refer the reader to the above work for the gratification of his curiosity.

CHAPTER XIII.

AN AFFECTING SCENE.

âOn the night of the storming of Roderigo,â said he,
âI was one, among others, who pressed forward on the
French, up to the market-place, after they had abandoned
the defence of the walls. They had ceased to
make resistance, and the town was completely in our
possession, when I was induced, along with three
more of the regiment, to turn down one of the streets
for the purpose of searching the houses for articles of
value. Having entered two or three which were already
filled by our soldiers, we ran farther on from
the noise and riot, and stopped at a house which
seemed to be superior to those around it. The first
place we entered was the kitchen, where a few embers
[Pg 290]

were glowing on the hearth, and emitting a faint light
on the surrounding walls. An awful silence reigned
through the house, which was only interrupted by the
distant huzzas and riot of our troops. On throwing
some wood on the fire, we were enabled by its light to
find a lamp, with which we proceeded to search the
other apartments of the house. Every thing was in
orderâno sign of confusion more than if the family
had gone to bed in perfect security. This and the
stillness that reigned around, altered the complexion of
our minds, and tinged them with a feeling of solemnity
which we could not account for. Had there been
noise or disorder, or the appearance of any one having
been there on the same errand as ourselves, we would
have begun plundering without a thought; as it was,
we had gone through several apartments filled with
articles of value, without touching anything. On
reaching the upper flat of the house, we were startled
by hearing some one sobbing; and proceeding towards
the apartment from whence it issued, we discovered
the door ajar, and a light in the room. We hesitated
a moment, doubting whether it might not be some of
the French soldiers who had fled from the ramparts;
and preparing ourselves for defence, should such be
the case, we pushed up the door, and entered together.
But the scene which presented itself arrested our steps
at the entrance. Stretched on a couch lay a young
female apparently dying. Her motherâfor such we
understood her to beâsat supporting her head upon her
breast; while the father, kneeling by her side, held
a crucifix before her,âa female domestic kneeling at
her feet, bathed in tears, completed the group, and all
were busily employed in prayer. No notice was taken
of our entrance, except a slight start when we first
appeared; their feelings were too intensely bent on the
one object to attend to anything else. Life seemed to
be ebbing imperceptibly; her eye was fixed and glazed;
but ere her soul fled its earthly tenement for ever, a
strong convulsion seized her: this appearance of acute
suffering wrought up the minds of her parents to the
[Pg 291]

highest pitch of agony. We were so powerfully affected
by the scene, that we forgot every thing elseâforgot
the exultation and excitement of victoryâforgot
the errand which we had come on. Nature claimed
an undivided sway, and, wrapped in solemn and softened
feeling, we stood rooted to the spot, gazing, with
the tear of pity glistening in our eyes, on the lovely
being who was expiring before us. The struggle was
short, and the fearfully suspended groan which burst
from the agonised father, proclaimed that all was overâthe
mother sat gazing on the dead, lovely even in
death, with a vacant stupor in her eye, that told the
unutterable nature of her grief.

âWe were making a motion to depart, when the
father, for the first time, seemed to observe our presence,
and going over to a box, he took from it a purse filled
with money and offered it to us; but we refusedâfor
worlds we would not have touched anything in the
house. We shook hands in silence with the inmates,
retraced our steps slowly down the stairs, and were
soon involved in riot and confusion; but we were not
now in the mood for mixing in such scenes, and we
regained our column on the rampart, with our minds
filled with the solemn and affecting scene we had
witnessed.â

We had now reached the cottage, and as I intended
to return to my detachment that night, I was preparing
to depart, but they pressed me so warmly to pass
another evening with them that I could not refuse, and
a happier evening I never spent. After much varied
conversation, kept up with great spirit by the family,
we insensibly returned to our old topic, the state of
Ireland, and canvassing the motives and lawless proceedings
of the people in the neighbourhood.

âPoor wretches!â said Eugene, âthey know not
what they are doing; they feel themselves oppressed
and miserable, and, like the inferior animals, they kick
in the direction the pain is inflicted, but political aim
they have none. In fact, the poor creatures who are
[Pg 292]

associated with these parties by choice or compulsion,
are invariably the most ignorant part of the community,
and I believe have not sufficient ability among them to
carry any organised measure into execution. I have
had opportunities of knowing them more accurately
than many, for I have been once or twice at their
meetings; and whatever interested or designing men
may advance to the contrary, I assure you they are
only actuated by one feelingârevenge on their oppressors;
and such a thing as an attempt to overturn the
government was never agitated amongst them. That
sufficient misery exists among the Irish to spur them
on to desperation, I believe few people who know anything
of the country will deny. Much of this misery
is too deeply seated to yield to any of the nostrums
prescribed for its cure; it is, like some of the diseases
of the body, which are best cured by supporting the
system, withdrawing all cause of irritation, and leaving
the rest to nature. But the most prominent and apparent
cause of it is, that there is no adequate employment
for the inhabitants, no extensive manufactures
among them; the people, therefore, are obliged to
revert to the land for support, which, from being let at
a rack-rent, to supply the extravagance of the proprietors
in another country, barely yields a subsistence;
and the poor cottar, even when he submits to live on
potatoes three times a-day, exists in continual dread of
being turned out, or having his effects distrained for
the rent, which, with all his efforts, he is unable to
raise. Living thus in continual dread of utter starvation,
is it to be wondered at that they should feel
irritable; and that, when they see their hard-earned gains
rapaciously forced from them, under colour of law, to
support clergymen of a different persuasion, or the
non-resident landlord, who, âlike the barren sand,
imbibes the shower,â but yields no returnâis it to be
wondered at that the poor peasant, thus goaded on to
destruction, should turn upon his drivers, and, overlooking
the primary agents in his miseries, vent his
blind fury on those who, from their subordinate situation,
[Pg 293]

come in closer contact with him? Thus the
tithe-proctor, the middle-man, or the stranger who is
introduced to occupy the land from which he has been
ejected, and has now no refuge left him from famine,
are the common objects of his resentment. All these
evils which I have described, are acknowledged and
lamented, and lectured upon at great length by many

lazy
good people, who do not put forth a finger to ease
the burden, if we except the exertions of certain
Societies, who, with the best motives, I have no doubt,
distribute Bibles and Tracts among our starving
countrymen; but some security against actual want
is necessary before a man can cultivate his mind, or
make any great improvement in morality: and a
religious tract, however useful it may be in its proper
place, is but an indifferent substitute for bread.

âThere exists a strong desire to convert the Catholics
from the error of their ways; but what benefit could
accrue from unsettling their faith, without improving
their conduct, I am at a loss to know. Judging from
that of the lower class of Protestants in Ireland, I do
not think they would benefit much by the exchange.
Whatever may be the difference between the two sects,
the morality they teach is the same: therefore I think
the better plan would be, to endeavour, by proper instruction,
and humane usage, to make them good
Catholics.â

âI perfectly agree with you on that point,â said I;
âfor if some miraculous change does not take place in
human nature, there must ever be a difference of opinion
in religious matters; and that which has most influence
on the conduct of its members must be the best. A
manâs belief ought to be left to his own conscience.
The mind in process of improvement, where it is left free
and unbiassed, gradually opens on the truth, and spurns
its former error; but force or undue influence creates
prejudice, and raises an insurmountable barrier to its
farther progress. All that seems wanting to your
countrymen is relief from present misery, and instructionâthen,
if Protestantism is a better religion than their
[Pg 294]

own, they will soon find it out. The energies of the
Irish are at present dormantâthey are enveloped, as it
were, in the haze of morning; but when the sun
does burst forth, theirs will be a glorious day.â

âYes,â said Mary, âthey have in them the elements
of a great people, and I am sure, were they used as
they ought to be, they would be submissive and loyal
to a fault.

There never were hearts, if our rulers would let them,

More formâd to be grateful and blest than ours!

âIt gives me the highest pleasure,âit does my heart
good, to hear any one speak in liberal or kindly terms
of my poor country.â Struggling with the feelings
which filled her bosom, unsolicited and spontaneously
she burst forth into the melody of,

Remember thee! yes, while thereâs life in this heart,

It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art:

More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom and thy showers,

Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours.

Wert thou all that I wish theeâgreat, glorious, and free,

First flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea,

I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow,

But, oh! could I love thee more deeply than now?

No! thy chains as they torture, thy blood as it runs,

But make thee more painfully dear to thy sonsâ

Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-birdâs nest,

Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast.

There was something peculiarly thrilling in her voiceâits
low tones breathed the sigh of a broken heartâthe
higher notes, wild and energetic enthusiasm. She
appeared to have sung the first two stanzas unconsciously;
for as she finished them, observing us listening,
she blushed and stopped short. Through our persuasion
she was induced to continue; but the glow of feeling
which had before animated her was gone, the spell was
broken, and although she still sung in a superior manner,
her voice had lost much of its former heart-searching
effect.

With feelings of sorrow that I cannot express, I
took leave of this happy family, whose existence, as it
[Pg 295]

were by enchantment, in the midst of misery and
crime, put me in mind of those green and fertile spots
which we sometimes found embosomed among the
wild and rugged Pyrenees.

CHAPTER XIV.

MARY.

I had not proceeded far on my journey, when I was
overtaken by EugeneââI have some little business in
town,â said he, âand I may as well accompany you.â
In the course of our conversation, I took occasion to
revert to his sister Mary, whose character had made a
strong impression on my mind,ââShe has too much
feeling,â said he, âfor her own happiness; she lives in
a constant state of excitement of one kind or another,
which her scanty knowledge of the world has not
been sufficient to subdue. Time and experience, however,
may rectify that fault.â

âGood-morrow to you, Master Eugene,â said a
countryman who was working in a field by the road
side.

âGood-morrow, Rooney,â said Eugene. âHave you
got every thing put to rights again?â

âIndeed I have, sir; but itâs yourself I have to
thank for it. May my blessing and the blessing of
God attend you and yours wherever you go.â

âI will call in and see you as I come back.â

âArrah do, masterâdonât forget.â

âThat poor fellow,â said Eugene, as we passed on,
âhad his house burned some time since, by a band of
those deluded wretches who infest the country. I have
several times introduced myself at their meetings, for
the purpose of reasoning with them on the wickedness
and folly of their proceedings; and some of the
most rational of them have been induced, through my
persuasion, to live peaceably; but others have threatened
to attack my own house, for daring to interfere
[Pg 296]

with them. I might, by giving information to the
magistrate, have had the ringleaders apprehended; but
besides having the national horror of an informer, I
am well aware that it would be productive of no good
in the country.

âOn several occasions, by receiving timely information,
I have been able to prevent the execution of
their revenge; but in poor Rooneyâs case I was too
late.

âSome time ago, a number of people in the neighbourhood
lost possession of their small farms, through
means of a pettifogging scoundrel of an attorney, who,
by paying a large fine to the agent, took the land on
lease, over their heads; the consequence was, that
their little farms (previously too high) were raised
in rent to double the sum. In this extremity they
came to the resolution of resisting the advance of
rent; the consequence was that they were forcibly
ejected, and tenants brought from a distance to
replace them, many of whom being intimidated by
anonymous threatenings posted on their doors, or
conveyed by letters, abandoned the houses; but others,
and among the rest Rooney, the individual whom we
have just now passed, determined to keep possession
and defend themselves against all who might dare to
molest them. Rooneyâs obstinacy induced the Shanavests
to resolve on forcing him out, and with that
purpose they paid him a midnight visit; but he and
his son were ready for them, and in answer to their
summons to open the door, he gave them the contents
of a blunderbuss. This exasperated them to the
highest pitch, and they used their utmost efforts to
burst the door open; but here he was also prepared,
having barricaded the passage with the heavy parts
of his furniture. I was informed of the intended
attack by Billy MâDaniel, who had heard some
hints of it from those concerned, and I hastened
to the house to endeavour to save the poor people
from their fury. When I arrived, they had succeeded
in forcing the door, but were still impeded
[Pg 297]

in their entrance by the things which Rooney had
piled in the passage. I beseeched, I entreated them to
desist; but my voice was drowned in the vociferations
and noise of the wretches, whose evil passions were
now roused to extremity. One rascal (I know him
well) had ran to a neighbouring cottage for a light, and
now attempted to hold a bundle of flaming straw to
the inside of the roof, for the purpose of setting it on
fire; regardless of the danger to which I was exposing
myself, I knocked him down with my stick, but a blow
on my head from some one behind laid me senseless on
the spot. When I recovered, the burning roof of the
cottage was falling about me; fear lent me strength,
and I sprung to my feet, when my ear was struck with
the cries of a child. I plunged forward through the
smoke to the place from whence the sound proceeded,
and in a settle bed, surrounded by burning thatch and
rafters, I found the poor innocent nearly suffocated.
It was the work of a moment to snatch it up and bear
it to the door, where I met the despairing mother, and
threw it into her arms.

âGod bless you and save you,â said she, âwhoever
you are.â

âFeeling the hazardous situation I was in, and
knowing that my motives might be misconstrued, and
my actions represented in the worst light, I hurried
homewards without speaking a word.

âI had not been many minutes at home, when I was
startled by some one knocking at the door. Although
I was conscious of having committed no fault, I felt
alarmed, and my heart beat violently. On opening
the window and looking out, I found it was Mr ââ,
the magistrate, with a party of soldiers. This at first
confirmed my fears, but they were soon dispelled, for
in answer to my inquiry, âwhat he wanted?â

ââI would be obliged to you,â said he, âif you
would get up and come along with me, for some rascals
have set Rooneyâs house on fire, and I am afraid
have murdered some of its inmates.â

âHaving muffled myself in a cloak, I came down
[Pg 298]

and accompanied him to the house, which I had left
half an hour before. It was now one burning mass,
shooting up showers of sparks into the air. Rooneyâs
son was with us, and in giving his relation to the
magistrate, told what I have already related.

ââThey couldnât get in upon us,â said he, âfor we
had thrown all the furniture into the passage, and had
given them two or three shots, when one fellow pushed
in with a lighted wisp in his hand, to set fire to the
house; some of his own party knocked him down;
but that did not save us, for they lighted the thatch of
the house before they left the door. We then became
desperate, and removing the things from the entry,
pushed out, determined to live or die. The villains
had escaped, but the whole roof was now in a blaze.
There was no time to lose, and gathering our trembling,
half-naked family together, we rushed into the field
before the house. On looking round the children, my
mother gave a scream âOh, my little Jane!â she
cried, and sprang forward to the burning cabin. A
little girl of four years of age had in the confusion been
left in bed, where she was lying asleep, unconscious of
the work of destruction going on. I instinctively
followed my mother, and as she approached the door,
I perceived a man burst from the burning house with
the childâthrow it into my motherâs arms, and immediately
disappear. I was so struck with surprise, that
I could not follow him, it seemed like the work of
some supernatural being.â

âWe had now reached the house, where we found
many of the neighbours assembled, and among them
some, like myself, who had been there before. I was
horror-struck at the dismal scene, and had there been
any prospect of the least good being done by it, I would
have had them all apprehended.

âIn going round the premises with the magistrate, we
met the poor woman, who was strolling about, mourning
the desolation of her dwelling. The light of the
burning house fell full upon my face as we metâshe
started at me for a moment, and exclaimed, âArenât you
[Pg 299]

the good gentleman who saved my child? O! God
Almighty bless you, for it is yourselfâI know you by
the blood on your face.ââI was confounded,âthe
magistrate looked doubtfully at me.

ââThere is really blood on your face, Mr MâCarthy.â

ââThere may be,â said I, endeavouring to recover
my self-possession, âfor I feel my nose bleeding, but you
surely know me better than to suspect that I had any
hand in this business.â

ââOh! not at all,â said he. But I could see that
suspicion was raised in his mind. Had he been a man
whom I could have trusted, I would have told him the
whole story; but I was too well aware of his disposition
to say anything about it; and as I knew he would be
questioning the woman concerning the circumstance
when my back was turned, I sought out Rooney and
told him every particular of the affair, and charged him to
say nothing about it. It was lucky I did, for Mr ââ had
them examined very minutely on the subject next day,
and endeavoured to draw something from them in confirmation
of my being implicated in the affair: but
Rooney kept his promise faithfully, and the woman
told him that she was sure now I was not the person
she had seen. What she said about the blood on my
face was perfectly correct, for my nose must have bled
profusely when I was knocked down, as I found it
crusted on my clothes next morning.

âI have since assisted Rooney, and you see how
grateful the poor fellow is.

âThis affair has induced me to be more cautious, for
the magistracy are so perfectly absolute, that I might
have been sent off to New South Wales (if I got off
with that) for my exertions on that night. Law is so
summary here, and so little evidence required against a
man whom they wish to ruin, that it reminds me of
some place in your country, where it is said they were
in the habit of hanging people first and then trying
them.â

When we parted, Eugene made me promise to pay them
an early visit; but being unexpectedly relieved from the
[Pg 300]

duty on that station, I never had the pleasure of seeing
them again. Shortly after, I received several letters
from him, wherein he detailed his sisterâs marriage and
happiness with her husband, and when I last heard
from him she was the happy mother of three children.

CHAPTER XV.

A DRUNKEN FROLIC.

While here, two of our sergeants, in a drunken frolic,
took it into their head to go and see their sweethearts
in Wexford. When they came thoroughly to their
senses, they were far on the journey, and thinking their
crime would be the same, they entered the town.
Their absence being discovered, a party was sent after
them, and they had not been many hours in the place,
when they were found, and marched back prisoners
to their regiment.

We expected they would have got off, by being
reduced from their rank; but the commanding officer
seemed to consider their crime of too heinous a nature,
to let them escape with an ordinary punishment. They
were tried by a General Regimental Court Martial, and
sentenced to be reduced to the rank and pay of private,
to receive five hundred lashes, to be branded on the side
with the letter D, and afterwards to be sent to (what is
usually termed) a banished regiment. One of them
was an intelligent man, who had been respectably
brought upâthe other a young man scarcely twenty
years of age; the former did not live to go abroadâhe
died in Dublin, I believe of a broken heart; the other
went abroad, but I never heard what became of him.

The impression throughout the regiment at the time
was, that the sentence was most unreasonably severe,
particularly that part of it that awarded the corporeal
punishment. Will that disgrace to the country never
be done away with? I am perfectly convinced it could
be done without, and those who advocate it, must be
[Pg 301]

men who are either wofully ignorant of human nature,
or whose passions obscure their reason, and induce
them to act contrary to their better judgment; the
latter is the most common of the two. I have known
commanding officers who have acted in this respect
rationally and wisely, while their personal feelings
were not strongly excited; but who, when they were
so, committed the most flagrant injustice.

Why should there not be a definite code of military
laws for the army? for that abstruse, vague, and indefinable
thing called âthe mutiny act,â surely does not
deserve the name. I defy any two persons separately,
to make the same commentary on it. In it so much
is left to the private opinion of courts martial, that
the sentences passed by them are often preposterously
unequal: for instance, I have known a man tried
by one court martial, and sentenced to three hundred
lashes, and another for the same crime, without any
palliating circumstance in his favour, sentenced to
fourteen daysâ solitary confinement. What are we to
make of this inconsistency? It is evident it proceeded
from the temper of the individuals composing the
court.

If these things appear hard or unjust, why not
rectify them, by attaching a definite punishment to
every crime, at least as far as circumstances admitted?
The business of courts martial would then be clear
and easy; nor would officers feel themselves in the
unpleasant predicament in which they are often placed.
Corporeal punishment ought to be abolished altogether;
I am perfectly convinced it could be done without.
In many regiments we have strong proofs of the allegation;
and the fact, that where punishment is most
frequent, the men are the worst behaved, and
vice
versa
, cannot be denied.

It cannot fail to humble a regiment to have one of
their number flogged, and it ruins the individual. No
man who has prided himself on his character, can
look up after it: he bears a humiliating sense of disgrace
about him for ever after,ââa worm that will
[Pg 302]

not sleep, and never dies.â My character, he will say,
is gone, I can never hold up my head among my
comrades; all prospect of promotion is lost to me, for
should my officers at any future period offer it, how
could I, who have been tied up, and my back lacerated
before the gaze of the whole regiment, ever feel confidence
to command those who have witnessed my
disgrace, and to whom I have been an object of pity
or scorn, either of which is alike humiliating to a mind
not entirely callous.

Many may wonder at my warmth on this subject;
but if they had, like me, seen the dreadful extremity
to which it was at one time carried, they would cease
to be surprised. Who that has ever seen a man
stripped before the gaze of a regiment, his limbs bound
to the halberts, and the knotted scourge lacerating his
flesh, while the surgeon stood by to measure by the
pulse the amount of human agony which the poor
wretch could suffer, would ever wish to see it again?

The first man I saw flogged, received eight hundred
lashes, for desertionâit would have been more merciful
to have shot him. But men have been known to
receive a thousand lashes before they were taken down
from the halberts; and on occasions where nature
could not bear the punishment awarded at once, they
have been brought out again, and again, to have their
half-healed backs torn open afresh! They have been
known to faint under their punishment, and again be
flogged into life! On other occasions their agony was
lengthened out by giving the lash by tap of drum,
allowing half a minute to elapse between each tap, and
when the mangled back was cut through the skin, and
the bare muscle quivered under the scourge, the only
mercy extended was to inflict the rest of the punishment
on some other part of the body! And yet all
this was done under the eyes of people professing
Christianity and civilizationâwho were yearly inundating
Parliament with petitions against flogging
negroes with a cart-whipâyes, while the blood of
their countrymen was sprinkling a barrack square, and
[Pg 303]

their cries were ringing in their ears! They saw it
notâheard it notâtheir feelings were too fine for
aught but distant misery. The groans of their tortured
countrymen were given to the windâno voice was
heard in their behalfâno arm was raised to save. Yes,
there were a few who vindicated the cause of insulted
humanity, and they live in the grateful remembrance
of the soldier; but their efforts were rendered ineffectual
through the opposition of men whom I dare not trust
myself to speak about.

How individuals can be found to stand up in the
senate of a free and enlightened country, and vindicate
this brutal and inhuman mode of punishment, is an
anomaly not easy to be accounted for.

Thank God! the times I have described are gone
pastâmen cannot now be treated in that manner
without investigation; but still enough remains to
make us wish its abolition. Though flogging is now
seldom resorted to at home, I am afraid it is still too
prevalent in our colonies abroad, and may in a great
degree cause that debasement of mind, and habits of
inebriation, which we observe in the generality of
those soldiers who have been stationed long in the
East or West Indies.

If any crime committed by a soldier in the army
deserved corporeal punishment, the individual should no
longer be a member of it: after such punishment, he
ought to be discharged, as unworthy to be a soldier.
It may be argued that many would then commit crime,
when engaged in an unpleasant service, to get their
freedom; but those who would say so, know little of
human nature. Most men who have any character to
uphold, consider disgrace worse than death; and if
they had witnessed, as I have done, the reluctance
with which soldiers, in general, left their regiment,
when sick, even on the eve of battle, and what anxiety
they evinced to join, when restored to health, they
would think differently. Many schemers there are
in a regiment, certainly; but under any circumstances
they would be useless charactersâthere are drones in
[Pg 304]

every hive. To inspire and cherish the manly, honourable
spirit I have described, it is only necessary to
treat men as if they possessed it. Soldiers have their
failings, and their prominent vices, it is true; but they
generally lie on the surface, and their neighbours in
civil life have this advantage of them, that they âhave
the better art of hiding;â but in point of disinterested
feeling, and generosity of character, I question much
whether the soldier would lose by the comparison.

The besetting sin of the British soldier is drunkenness,
(the parent of many others,) produced, in a great
measure, by the leisure time which he has in general
hanging on his hands. I am sorry the only effectual
cure for this has not been pushed to the necessary
length,âI mean urging the men to improve their
minds, and affording them the means, which would
not only make them more useful soldiers, but enable
them to fill up their spare time with advantage to
themselves.

As an instance of this, there were a few of us in the
habit, instead of spending our idle time in the public-house,
of walking down by the river side, carrying our
books with us, and alternately reading and conversing.
Some of our comrades who had been addicted to drink,
sometimes joined us for the sake of the walk; and from
the pleasure they derived from the conversation, and
the new ideas awakened in their minds, they voluntarily
gave up their old habits, and became converts to our
system. We procured books on the various subjects
to which our attention was excited, and although not
quite masters of the subject, it would have surprised
many people to have heard our disquisitions on Natural
Philosophy, History, &c. Music was a favourite
amusement also, and by forming small parties, we were
never at a loss to pass the time, and when on guard,
(the most irksome time to others,) we found it the most
pleasant. Our number was not great, certainly, but a
little encouragement and countenance from our officers
might have done much. The detached situation of the
regiment often broke up our party, but still we
[Pg 305]

cherished the germ of intellectual improvement; and if
I have in any way gained the start of my comrades in
this respect, it has been by my application while in the
army, for when I first entered it, my education was
entirely confined to the elements of reading, writing,
and arithmetic.

I know there are men who look upon the increasing
intelligence of the lower classes of society with a fearful
eye, considering it as the precursor of revolution and
anarchy. The man who thinks so, must have a âworthless
neivefuâ of a soul.â Education, by improving the
understanding and ripening the judgment, leads men
to see clearly their own interest and follow it steadily,
and of course will always render them tractable to the
existing government, where that government is not
tyrannical and unjust. None have any reason to fear
the spread of knowledge, but those whose actions loathe
the light.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE DESERTER.

I was one day on the main guard in Kilkenny, when
a deserter, passing through under escort to Dublin, was
delivered to our charge. The poor fellow was accompanied
by his mother and two sisters. Such unusual
company with a man in his situation excited my curiosity,
and inquiring into the particulars of his case, he
told me that his father had died about two years before,
leaving his family, consisting of his wife and six children,
the lease of a small farm of twenty acres, at a moderate
rent; he was the elder child, and only son of the family,
and the charge and cultivation of the land principally
devolved upon him.

For two years things went on prosperously; but at
the end of that time the lease expired through the
failure of the last life on which it depended. This was
a sudden and unlooked-for event; but as they had been
regular tenants, they had never doubted for a moment
[Pg 306]

that they would get their lease renewed. In this,
however, the poor creatures were mistaken, for when
Frank called on the agent, he found that unless he could
raise twenty pounds in cash, to give by way of fine,
the farm would be given to some person who would
give it. Sorrowful enough he returned home, and
communicated this intelligence to his mother and
sisters, who were thunderstruck; for raising twenty
pounds in cash was out of the question. Many plans
were thought of, but none fully answered the purpose,
for when all their efforts were exerted, they were only
able to raise twelve pounds out of the twenty. The
day on which Frank was to give in his answer was fast
approaching, and as a last resource, it was determined
that he should apply for the loan of the required sum to
a gentleman, a friend of his fatherâs, who lived in an
adjacent village; unluckily for poor Frank, when he
went there, the gentleman was in Dublin, and was not
expected home for a month.

Depressed and melancholy, he was returning home,
not knowing what to do, when he met a recruiting
party beating up through the town. The thought struck
him instantly that he might raise the necessary sum by
enlisting, and acting from the impulse of the moment,
without nicely weighing the consequences, he took
the kingâs money; and after he got his bounty, went
and took up the lease. He had never mentioned the
affair to his mother, and she believed that the money
was received from his fatherâs friend. The truth,
however, could not be long concealed, for the sergeant
came out to inform him that he had orders to send his
recruits to head-quarters, and it would be necessary
for him to be in readiness to leave home in three days.
He was, therefore, obliged to disclose what he had
done to his mother. It was dreadful news to the poor
woman, for, independent of her great affection for him,
he was her principal dependence in cultivating the
farm. âWhat use can the lease be to us,â said she,
âwhen we have nobody to mind it?â Frank felt the
truth of what she said; but he endeavoured to console
[Pg 307]

her by saying, that as Tim Brachnie, their neighbour,
was on the point of marrying his elder sister Sally,
they would not miss him, for Tim was well able to
manage the land. As for himself, he was happy at
having it in his power to secure a living to the friends
he loved so much, and he was sure that he would
agree better with the life of a soldier than labouring at
home; he might soon rise to be a sergeant, perhaps
make his fortune in the East Indies, and come home
and make them all happy.

However Frank might please himself with these
speculations, they afforded little consolation to his
mother. But there was no helping the matter; he was
obliged to bid his friends adieu, and march to join the
depot in Chatham, the regiment being in the East
Indies.

Shortly after his arrival, a draft was selected for
embarkation to join the regiment. Frank was among
the number, and he wrote home, taking a farewell of
his friends. The time of his embarkation was fast
approaching, but he had received no answer to the
letter he had sent home; he felt grieved at this.
âCould I but see them for one half hour,â thought he,
âor at least get a letter from them before I go, I would
feel satisfied;â but the day previous to the intended
embarkation arrived without any letter. As he was
sitting melancholy in the barrack-room, pondering over
this unaccountable neglect, one of his comrades told
him that some one wanted him outside the barrack
gate. Frankâs heart leaped to his mouth, he made
haste to obey the summons, and entering a room of
the public-house to which he was directed, he was
struck mute with astonishment on perceiving his mother
and two of his sisters, who flew into his arms, clung
round him, and cried and laughed by turns. âWhen
do you go, my child?â said his mother. âTo-morrow,â
replied Frank. âFor Godâs sake, is that true! O
Frank! what will I do? You are going where I
will never see you again; youâll never live to get there,
and what will become of your poor mother, when she
[Pg 308]

hears of your death?âbut sheâll never live to hear of
it, if you go.â Poor Frank was sadly perplexed. âI
have walked a hundred miles in Ireland, and two
hundred and fifty in England,â said his mother, âbesides
crossing the salt ocean, and your poor sisters walking
foot for foot with meâand God knows we hadnât
much to live onâour money wasnât very plenty, and
the people in this country are not so ready stretching
out their hands as the poor Irish. Now, Frank, youâre
going to leave us for ever, and if you do, your poor
mother will never see Ireland again, for sheâll die on
the road, in a strange country, and what will become
of your poor sisters?â This was touching Frank on a
tender pointâa vague resolution flitted through his
mindâhe had found the life of a soldier not so much
to his liking as he at first expected. âI wouldnât wish
to advise you to desert,â said one of the sisters, who
saw Frank wavering; âbut how can you leave us and
your poor mother forlorn here.â âOch, the king, God
bless him!â said his mother, âwill never miss you out of
so many, and the Lord knows your poor mother would
miss you all the days of her life.â

Frank had summoned his honour and fair fame to
his side; but what do they know of these things in the
bogs of Ireland? thought heâHis oathâay, that was
a tickler; but isnât it like a custom-house oathâAnd
then his poor mother. Frank yielded to their solicitations.
The next point was to make his escape; but
that was soon arranged,âhe was dressed in a suit of
his elder sisterâs clothes, and under the cloud of night
they set off on their return home.

They had a weary journey travelling to Bristol,
where they embarked on board the packet for Waterford,
and were safely landed on Erinâs green isle once
more. They had travelled a long dayâs stage on their
way home, and thinking themselves safe, were sitting
in their lodging-house refreshing themselves with a
cup of tea, when the sergeant who had enlisted Frank
came into the house, and presented a billet to the
landlady. He had been ordered to remove to another
[Pg 309]

station, and was so far on the way with his party. He
knew Frankâs mother the moment he came in, and
coming over inquired for her family, and when she
heard from her son. The poor woman was so confused,
that she did not know what she was saying, and
stammered out some nonsense, which, along with the
petrified appearance of the daughters, raised a suspicion
in his mind. Frank, in his female dress, sat holding
down his head,ââIs this your daughter Peggy thatâs
looking so bashful?â said the sergeant, putting his
hand out to raise up Frankâs chin, when he saw enough
of the face to understand who it was. Frank saw he
was detected, and dropping any attempt to disguise
himself farther, lifted the stool on which he was
sitting, to knock the sergeant down, as the only means
of effecting his escape; but the sergeant had beckoned
in his party, who were standing at the door, and he
saw that resistance would be madness, and therefore
submitted to his fate with the best grace he could. He
was sworn in a deserter and committed to jail, having
previously resumed his own dress, and was thus far on
his way to Dublin, accompanied by his mother and
sisters, who were determined, as they said themselves,
to follow him to the
end of the world
.

What became of poor Frank afterwards I never
heard, but happening to be in Chatham about two
years after, I inquired at one of the sergeants of the
depot, and found his story perfectly correct. I had
even the curiosity to go to the house where they had
effected his disguise, the landlady of which corroborated
the story so far as his mother and sisters being
in the house, and the soldiers coming there after him
when he was gone.

I have little left worthy of relating that occurred
while stationed in Kilkenny, but I cannot dismiss the
subject without paying a tribute of respect and admiration
to the character of the clergyman who acted as
chaplain to the troops in that placeâthe Rev. Mr
Rowe, rector of St Maryâs. Joined to an indefatigable
discharge of his duty, the purest benevolence, and a
[Pg 310]

liberal mind, he possessed an eloquence that caught
the attention of the most illiterate and careless. Our
men were never very remarkable for their church-going
propensities, but we had not been long in Kilkenny
when the greater part of the regiment voluntarily
attended his Sunday evening sermons. Without
stooping to coarseness of expression, he rendered himself
plain and intelligible to all; and by his earnest and
affectionate manner, endeared himself to his hearers.
His preaching had a very visible effect on the conduct
of many of our men, and I am sure they all remember
him with feelings of esteem and veneration. He was
no time-server, âwith doctrines fashioned to the varying
hour,â but rigidly followed the example of his
Master in being âno respecter of persons.â It would
be well for the people of Ireland were all the clergymen
of the established church like Mr Rowe.

As a specimen of the familiar manner in which he
drew the menâs attention, I was once on the jail guard
when he came to visit the prisoners. Those of the
guard not posted as sentinels were always called in on
such occasions, and when we were assembled he read
some passages of Scripture; but while he was reading
the menâs attention wandered. Perceiving this, he shut
the book, and looking round his audience, âI will tell
you a story,â said he; every eye was fixed on him,
ready to hear the promised tale:â

âThere was once a gentleman possessed of great
riches, and he lived up to his income, enjoying all that
this world could afford. He was on the point of setting
out on a pleasure tour, when he took suddenly ill and
soon after died. Some time after, a gentleman, who
had been on very intimate terms with the deceased,
but ignorant of his death, called at the door, and asked
the servant if his master was at home; the servant
replied, in melancholy accents, âAlas, sir! my master
has gone to his long homeâhe is dead.â âDead!â
said the gentleman, horror-struck with the news, but
recovering himself,ââWell,â said he, âit is the road
we must all go sooner or laterâbut I hope he has gone
[Pg 311]

to heaven?â The servant, who knew his masterâs wild
manner of living, shook his head. âWhat!â said the
gentleman, âdo you doubt it?â âI donât know,â said
the servant, âbut when my master was on the eve of
going a journey, he was always talking about it, and
making great preparations some days before he set out;
but during his illness I never once heard him mention

heaven
.â

âAre you, my friends, making preparation for that
long journey that we must all soon take?â

He then took advantage of their attention being
awakened to impress upon them the necessity of that
preparation.

CHAPTER XVII.

LIKENESSES.

About the period of which I am now writing, the
service of a number of our men expired. Where they
were good characters they were strongly pressed to re-enlist;
but many of them seemed to be satiated with
their seven yearsâ apprenticeship,âamong the others,
some of my comrade sergeants, who were induced to
leave the service in disgust at the conduct of some of
their officers, one in particular, whose situation brought
him in closer contact with them. He had risen from
the ranks to the situation which he then held, by dint
of a species of
noisy activity
, which was at that time in
great request. It was not enough to bid a man do a
thing, but the command must be accompanied with a
few oaths, in a stentorian voice, that roused every echo
within a mile; and it would have been diverting and
ludicrous in the extreme, to a person unaccustomed to
the business, to hear an order given by the commanding
officer when in the field, ringing along through the
chain of underlings, increasing in strength and vociferation,
until it reached the quarter for which it was
intended. I am not sure whether I have conveyed to
the reader a clear idea of what I wish to describe; but
[Pg 312]

if he has ever been along-side a dog kennel, and watched
the progress of their sweet voices, from the first note
sounded by the master of the band, until the whole
pack, tagrag and bobtail, joined in the melodious concert,
he will have some notion of what I mean. The
officer in question considered this quality so essentially
necessary to the character of a non-commissioned
officer, that those who did not abuse or blackguard the
men under their command, were considered unfit for
the situation. So particular was he in this respect,
that if he heard of a sergeant being praised by his
company, that individual was set down in his mind as
a candidate for the first privateâs coat that might be
vacant. âYou are one of the good fellows, I believe,â
he would say, addressing the offending non-commissioned
officer, âDamme, Iâll good fellow ye.â

He had a system of favouritism which he pursued
in the corps, to the almost total exclusion of any, but
those
he
recommended to the situation of a non-commissioned
officer. The power he possessed to do this
was partly acquired by his own presumption, and
partly by the indolence or apathy of the officer commanding.
The result, however, was, that men were
promoted to the situation who could not write their
own name: being consequently dependent on their
inferiors for doing their duty, they could scarcely be
very fit persons to hold the situation, and as they could
not help being conscious of their inability, it must have
been irksome and unpleasant to themselves. In this,
however, they were the more like himself, for without
any great stretch of imagination, his writing might
have been mistaken for Arabic; as to the other parts
of a gentlemanâs education, he knows best whether he
possessed them or not.

But I am digressingâI was talking of the sergeants
leaving the corps when their period of service expired.
Several of them were sent for, and promised great
things if they would re-enlist; but from the reason I
have already mentioned, they declined doing so. The
consequence was, that during the short time they
[Pg 313]

remained in the regiment, they were treated by him in
the harshest manner; this was low, illiberal conduct,
and certainly did no good to the service.

In the absence of senior officers, we were some time
under the command of a young man, who was newly
promoted to the rank of major. He had the elements
of a good commanding officer in him, and in his discipline
endeavoured to copy Colonel Lloyd; but the
nervous manly spirit was wantingâthe perfect self-confidence
in his own powers and judgment, which the
original possessed. Vacillating and infirm of purpose,
he was alternately led by some officer or another; and
although he disliked the one whose portrait I have
given in the preceding page, yet he had not resolution
enough to oppose the measures which he carried by
dint of impudence. Thus his efforts to imitate Colonel
Lloyd were often rendered farcical. For instance, in
endeavouring to establish the cleanliness and regularity
of messing, which the corps was so remarkable for,
while under the command of Colonel Lloyd, the men
were encouraged to provide extra dishes, on the anniversaries
of any of our battles, which, in addition to
the whisky purchased for the occasion, took away a
good deal of their pay, as these red-letter days occurred
very frequently. The consequence was, that the men
were getting so much the epicure, in a small way, that
they would willingly have held anniversaries on every
day of the year, had it not been that as the lining
inside increased, the covering of the outside was getting
thinner. This, however, soon wrought its own cure.
But after all, Major Cââ was a warm-hearted, feeling
gentleman; all he wanted, was experience, and a little
more knowledge of human nature. I have no doubt
but by this time he is an excellent officer.

He was succeeded by one whom I need not name,
we all knew him well enough. The first time I remember
him in command of the regiment, he was
superintending a punishment, which he ordered to be
given by tap of drum. As he paced up and down the
square, listening to the cries of the poor wretch, with
[Pg 314]

a countenance, in which the green and yellow were
striving for predominance, with the dark tinge which
it had naturallyââhe grinned horribly a ghastly smile,â
which I think I see before me at this instant, in all its
native deformity; but we were not much troubled with
his company during the fighting days. I have ransacked
my memory, endeavouring to find some good
action he had done while in the corps, to throw into
the scale against the rest of his conduct; but I am
obliged to give up the task in despair.

It may be asked, was there no bright reverse to
oppose to this picture? Yes there was,âCaptain
Gââ, witty, intelligent, and good humoured, with
his face reflecting all the good qualities of his heart;
Captain Dââ Cââ, the kind and benevolent, who
still cherishes his kindly feeling to the old corps, and
has done more for the individuals who belonged to it
than any man in the regiment; Captain Kââ, a
gentleman of refined manners and education; Captains
Cââ, Bââ, and Aââ; and last, though not least,
a man who ought to have been a major a dozen years
agoâhe had been in India with the corps, and commanded
the light company through the Peninsula; but
he is still a captain, although many must have passed
over his head in the course of two-and-twenty years.
Though rather unpolished in his manners, he was a
good officerânot very eloquent; however, the speech
he made to his company, previous to their being
engaged for the first time in Portugal, will long be
remembered:â

âThe French are before you, my ladsâlet us fight
manfully: if we live weâll be an honour to our country,
and if we die,â (lowering his voice,) âitâs no great consequence.â

Some may be inclined to think, from my warmth on
the subject of flogging, and the freedom with which I
have treated the character of officers, that I may myself
have smarted under the lash; or at least that I feel
envious and disappointed at not being promoted in the
service. When I first set out in my narrative, I resolved
[Pg 315]

to keep myself in the back ground; and I might
have closed my story without telling the public farther
than what they now know, were it not that my statements
might suffer from surmises similar to that I have mentioned;
but for the sake of truth, and in justice to myself
and the service, I think it necessary to state, that
I did not long remain a private. I entered the service
at fourteen years of age, was corporal before I was sixteen,
and by the time I attained my eighteenth year, I
had risen to that rank which few men who enlist as
private soldiers can ever hope to pass in the British
army. During my service, I have held situations that
required something more than ordinary ability and
steadiness, and I possess testimonials of character from
my various commanding officers that I have every
reason to be proud of.

If I have spoken freely of the abuse of power in the
army, I have done it through a natural hatred to
oppression and tyranny, which every thinking man
must feel; and as a subject of a free and enlightened
country, I claim a right to speak my sentiments. I
have no prejudice against the aristocracy of the armyâfar
from itâthere are many of them whom I esteem
and respectâmany of them intelligent and liberal-minded
men, who would do honour to any profession;
but there are also others of a different stamp, supercilious,
overbearing tyrants, who think their fellow-men
created to be their slaves, and ignorant, swaggering
coxcombs, whose puppyism must disgust all under their
command. I have spoken of them as they merited,âlet
each claim his meed of praise or censure as he may
think himself deserving it.

I believe few people set out in life with higher notions
of rank or greatness than I did. The reading I indulged
tended to increase it,âeven the favourite tragedy
[20]

which we were in the habit of reciting on Saturday
in school, taught me that there was something in
[Pg 316]

noble blood that shone in the countenance, and inflamed
the heart, though the possessor were born in a shed,
and bred among beggarsâsome impress that marked
the refined gold of creation. This was imposing in
theory, and finely calculated for the ideal world I then
lived in; but when I entered upon the stage of the
great world, and had an opportunity of seeing those
favoured individuals, I felt as much disappointment as
the poor woman, who ran half-a-dozen miles to see the
king, and after all discovered that he was only a man.
The result was, that I learned to look on gold lace and
epaulettes without being dazzled, and in forming my
opinion of the individual, to go a little deeper than his
splendid outside. The haughty contempt or insolence
of a superior, and the cringing sycophancy of understrappers,
many of whom were ready to hunt down on
the slightest hint any poor devil who had the misfortune
to incur the displeasure of his officer, gave me the
keenest mortification; but it threw me on my own
energies, and taught me to exist within myself, independent
of the smiles or frowns of those around me:
although my body was constrained, my soul was freeâand
I could detest a tyrant, and despise a blockhead,
whatever his rank might be.

Let it not be thought, however, that I dislike men,
because they stand above me in the scale of societyâfar
from it. Where they are good men, I respect and
esteem them the more, that they are so in spite of the
power and temptation they have to be the contrary.
I have invariably found, that the real gentleman is
mild and unassuming in his manners, and possesses
more feeling for his fellow-creatures, than those who
start into rank or wealth.

CHAPTER XVIII.

STORY OF RESTON.

From Kilkenny the regiment removed to Dublin,
where, being quartered in a barrack outside the town,
the dull sameness of our duty was broken in upon by
little worthy of relation. One incident, however, I
may relate, that will not only support opinions advanced
in this work, but also give me an opportunity
of doing justice to an individual, which inadvertence
only caused me to delay so long.

While in Kilkenny we got a musician from a militia
regiment to teach our band. He was a first-rate performer;
but in saying so, I sum up all his good qualities,
for a more ignorant mulish blockhead I never
met with. Our officers, listening only to the sweet
sounds which he elicited from the various instruments,
thought he could not fail to make our band as good musicians
as himself, and proud of his acquirements, they
granted him every indulgence; but he had no more art in
communicating his knowledge of the science to others,
than the clarionet on which he played; and his morose,
overbearing temper actually kept the regiment in a
constant broil. Not a day passed, nay, scarcely an
hour, without a complaint from him, against some one
or another; and as those complaints were sometimes
listened to, and the individuals complained of punished
in some shape to please him, the life of a musician in
the regiment was no enviable one. Among them was
a young lad of the name of Reston, whose growing
talent, in spite of every obstacle, threatened to outdo
his masterâthis roused his jealousy, and he prohibited
him, on various pretences, from the use of both music
and instruments, by which he might have improved
himself; but, not content with this, he tormented him
by all the nameless methods which a superior in the
army can, I am sorry to say, too often do with impunity.
Poor Reston was known to the officers and
[Pg 318]

his comrades as a boy of remarkably precocious talent,
not in music alone, but in every thing; and naturally
of a proud spirit, he could ill brook the insult and
oppression which was heaped upon him, and seeing
that his enemy was supported in every thing that he
did, his mind was wrought up to desperation, and he
desertedâtaking his passage in a vessel from Dublin
to Glasgow, where his parents resided.

On his arrival there, instead of endeavouring to
palliate his offence, they represented it to him in the
most heinous light, urged him, as the only way to
amend his fault, to return to his regiment immediately;
and lest anything might deter him, his
mother accompanied him to Dublin, and gave him
up to the commanding officer. Reston was pardoned,
and re-commenced his duty; but the spirit of his
oppressor was in no way alteredâhe took every
opportunity of provoking him. Restonâs feelings
were keen in the extreme; but he suffered patiently
for a length of time, until one morning, when the
regiment was going out to drill, provoked beyond
measure by taunts and insults, he replied in terms
that were construed into something resembling
mutinyâthis was immediately reported by the
fellow who had aggravated himâthe consequence was,
that he was tried by a court martial on the field, and
punished. He did not receive more than twenty-five
lashes, when he fainted and was taken downâhis
back was little hurt, but the scourge had entered
his soulâhe never recovered it. He begged his
friends strongly to purchase his discharge, and they
made the necessary application at head-quarters,
but it was resisted at the regiment. Seeing this, his
mother travelled to London herself, and petitioned His
Royal Highness for her sonâs discharge, representing
her own services to urge its being granted; but the
usual official routine being gone through, the required
permission was again combated at the regiment, and
declined at head-quarters. The consequence was, that
poor Reston was driven to despair, and seeing no hope
[Pg 319]

of being relieved by any other means from the oppression
under which he groaned, he again deserted, and
has never since been heard of.

Thus, a young man of genius, and abilities of no
common kind, was ruined, to keep in countenance one
of the veriest blockheads that ever appeared in human
shape, who at length sunk into well-merited disgrace,
but not before many good men were punished, and
otherwise unjustly used for his sake.

I have alluded to his mother representing her
services to the commander-in-chiefâI shall now give
her character, and then leave the reader to judge
whether she had not some claim upon the indulgence
of those in office at head-quarters.

She was the individual who distinguished herself
so nobly at Matagorda, near Cadiz, while the French
were besieging the latter place in 1810. Her husband
was then a sergeant in the ninety-fourth regiment, and
one of the detachment that occupied that fort, when
the French bombarded it with thirty piece of cannon.
It may be easily conceived what havoc would be
created by so much artillery playing upon a place not
more than an hundred yards square, and it may also
be imagined that few women could have maintained
ordinary courage or self-possession in such a place:
but from the commencement of the action she behaved
in a manner which it is scarcely in my power to do
justice to. The bomb-proofs being too small to contain
the whole garrison, some of the men had huts formed
on the battery, and among the rest was that of Mrs Reston.
When the French opened upon us, she was wakened
out of her sleep by a twenty-four pound shot striking
the facine where her head lay; but nothing daunted,
she got up, and removing her child, a boy of four
years old, down to the bomb-proof, she assisted the
surgeon in dressing the wounded men, who were fast
increasing on his hands, for which purpose she tore up
her own linen and that of her husband. Water being
needed, one of the drum-boys was desired to go and
draw some from the well in the centre of the battery; but
[Pg 320]

he did not seem much inclined to the task, and was lingering
at the door with the bucket dangling in his hand.ââWhy
donât you go for the water?â said the surgeon.ââThe
poor thingâs frightened,â said Mrs Reston, âand
no wonder at it: give it to me, and Iâll go for it.â So
saying, she relieved the drummer from the perilous
duty, and amid the dreadful discharge of artillery
playing upon the battery, she let down the vessel to fill
it with waterâshe had scarcely done so, when the
rope was cut by a shot; but she determined to get her
message with her, and begging the assistance of a
sailor, she recovered the bucket, and brought it filled
with water down to the bomb-proof, where her attention
to the wounded soldiers was beyond all praise. In
the intervals, she carried sand bags for the repair of
the battery, handed along ammunition, and supplied
the men at the guns with wine and water; and when
the other two women (who had been in hysterics in
one of the bomb-proofs, from the time the action had
commenced,) were leaving the battery, she refused to
go. Next morning our ammunition being expended,
we ceased firing, and the French, seeing the dilapidated
state of the fort, sent down a strong force to take
possession of the place; and our men were mustered
for their reception, when Mrs Reston was at her post
with the others, determined to share in the danger.
It was a critical moment, for had they got under the
range of our guns, our efforts would have been unavailing.
Through the ruinous state of the fort, three
guns, all that we could bring to bear upon them, were
crammed with loose powder, grape, ball cartridge, &c., to
the muzzle, ready for a farewell shot, and when they
came within two or three hundred yards of the fort, we
poured their contents into the very heart of the
column, and laid the half of them prostrate on the earth.
Those who survived took to flightâtheir batteries
again opened, and a fresh supply of ammunition having
arrived for us, we returned their salute; but the place
being found untenable, the surviving part of the
garrison were withdrawn by the boats of our fleet.

[Pg 321]

Mrs Reston still exhibited the same undaunted spirit.
She made three different journeys across the battery
for her husbandâs necessaries and her own. The last
was for her child, who was lying in the bomb-proof.
I think I see her yet, while the shot and shell were
flying thick around her, bending her body over it to
shield it from danger by the exposure of her own person.
Luckily she escaped unhurt, and still lives, and is at
present residing in Glasgow. But will it be believed
that she never received the smallest token of approbation
for her intrepid conduct, and the service which she
rendered on that occasion?

After her husband was some time discharged, she
was induced, at the instigation of officers who were
well acquainted with her heroic conduct, to make a
representation to the commander-in-chief, who warmly
recommended her case to the Secretary at War; but
the cold reply was, that he had no funds at his disposal
for such a purpose. Generous, noble nation! surely
the advocates for economy had little to find fault with
here.

Mrs Reston is now advanced in years,
[21]
and although
her husband enjoys the regulated pension for his
services, he is unable to work for his subsistence, and
surely one shilling and tenpence a-day to support two
individuals, is no great excuse, as it has been made, for
not making any exertion in her favour.

The only instance of the kind, exclusive of that related,
that I witnessed in the course of my service, was
in the person of a woman who lived as the wife of a
captain of one of the light companies of our brigade.
She accompanied him through the campaign, exposed
to all the dangers and privations attending on such a
life, with a devotedness that no legally-married woman
could have surpassed. At the battle of Vittoria, when
the army was engaged, she was left with the baggage;
but hearing from some of the disabled men that the
[Pg 322]

captain was wounded, she mounted her horse, and
galloped down into the scene of action, regardless of
the danger, to seek out and relieve him wherever he
might be. She found him when he had breathed his
last, and stopped by him until he was buried. This
was an appalling blow for her: she was left friendless
in a strange country; but those who paid her any
little attention in the captainâs lifetime, now felt no
compassion for her. Her gold watch, her favourite
pony, and all that she formerly held through her protector,
were taken from her, and a short time after, I
saw her struggling through the mud on the line of
march, with the shoes torn off her feet. She soon
after disappeared, but what became of her I do not
know.

Since the publication of this work, her husband is dead, and
she is now living in the poor-house of Glasgow.

CHAPTER XIX.

A LETTER.

I had letters from home that my father had been
in bad health for some time, and I now received one,
saying, that no hope was entertained of his recovery,
and if a furlough could be procured, to come home
without delay, as he had expressed an anxious wish
to see me. I lost no time in making the necessary
application, and being successful, I went in search of a
vessel. I found one that had put in to Dublin through
contrary winds, and was now ready to sail the moment
it was fair. I was impatient to get forward; but as
there was some prospect of the wind coming round in
our favour, I took lodging in a house on the quay. I
had been acquainted with the people who kept it, as
they had lived in Wexford previous to their coming to
Dublin. Having mentioned the vessel that I intended
to take my passage by, Mrs Lââ asked her husband
if that was the vessel Eliza was going in. On his
replying in the affirmative, âI am glad of it,â said she,
âour friend may be able to pay her some attention on
[Pg 323]

board, and perhaps be of some service to her when
she lands at Glasgow. I know I can trust you with
her story,â said she to me; âand when you hear it, I
am sure you will feel as much interest in the fate of the
poor creature as I do.â Without following Mrs Lââ
through all the various digressions and windings of her
story, I have taken the liberty to relate it, according
to the knowledge I afterwards had an opportunity of
acquiring:â

Eliza Rââ was the daughter of a respectable
farmer in the county of ââ. She was the eldest of
the family, and considered the beauty of the small
village she lived in. There was a soft loveliness about
her features, and a benignity beaming in her mild
blue eyes, expressive of purity and peace within. Her
modesty and goodness of heart had made her a favourite
with all her neighbours; and she was so retired
and correct in her conduct, and unremitting in her
religious duties, that she was looked upon as a superior
being. Eighteen years of Elizaâs life had passed
away without any event occurring to disturb its even
current. Many of the young men of the village would
willingly have proposed for her hand; but they were
restrained by an awe which her beauty and conduct
had inspired.

It was about this time that a gentleman belonging
to the revenue department, whose business led him to
the coast, came down from Dublin; and there being
no house of public entertainment, he begged a lodging
for the short time he had to stop from Michael Rââ.
It was instantly granted; and he had scarcely become
an inmate of the house when he cast his eyes on Eliza,
and his heart was inflamed with a passion which he
determined, if possible, to gratify. Her modest, retiring
disposition left him little room to make familiarity
with her; but observing that she was a rigid
attendant on mass, he feigned a devotion which he
did not feel, and by this pretence had an opportunity
of escorting her to chapel. His person and manners
were prepossessing, and his language fluent. But
[Pg 324]

it is unnecessary to enter into a detail of the
measures he took to accomplish his purpose; suffice
it to say, that he won the heart of the too confiding
Eliza,âhe had sworn to make her his wife, and
she believed him,âall was arranged between them,âhe
was to go to Dublin, and settle his affairs, provide
a house for her reception, and return to marry her and
conduct her home. The unsuspecting parents saw his
partiality for her, and felt proud of it; they little knew
the serpent they were fostering in their bosom. Poor
Eliza parted from him in the faith of a speedy return,
and dreamed of years of happiness, which, alas! she
was never to enjoy.

The time of his promised return elapsed, and day
after day rolled on without him making his appearance.
She now began to feel dreadful anxiety,âshe had
received no direction how to write, and had no means
of learning anything concerning him. He must be
sick, thought she, or some accident has befallen him,
or he would be here; and she grieved that she knew
not where to seek him, that she might tend and watch
over him. She was soon doomed to be undeceivedâa
neighbour, who had been at Dublin, called upon her
father with some articles which he had employed him
to purchase. âWhen you were in Dublin,â said
Michael, âdid you see anything of the gentleman who
lodged with us before you went away?â

âThat I did,â replied the visitor, âI took a parcel for
him from Mr Wâââs.â

âHe told us he was to be back here again in a week;
but something unlooked for has kept him, for we
havenât seen a sight of him since.â

âI donât think heâll be able to come at present,â said
Billy, âfor when I was in Dublin his wife was very ill.â

âHis wife!â exclaimed Eliza, who had been an attentive
listener to the conversation.

âAy, his wife,â said Billy; âhe was married about
two years ago to a lady belonging to Bââ.â

Eliza heard no more; she had summoned up all her
energy to meet the confirmation of the dreadful news;
[Pg 325]

but the struggle was too muchânature gave way, and
she sunk lifeless from her chair. They ran to her
assistance, and having raised her, succeeded by slow
degrees in bringing her back to life. On recovering,
she felt that she was ruined for ever; but the necessity
of keeping her own secret, acted as a counterpoise to
despair, and induced her to smother her feelings. Her
parents were not surprised at her fainting, for they
were aware of his attentions, and they could feel for
her situation; but they had no knowledge of the extent
of her misery. She was partially recovering from the
effects of her grief, when she found herself in a way
which she could not long hope to conceal. Her agony
of mind now became excessive; she could not endure
that her disgrace should be known in the neighbourhood,
and she determined on leaving her home, and
travelling to some distant part of the country. Packing
up her clothes, and taking some money with her, she
travelled to the nearest port, where she embarked for
Dublin, and having found Mrs Lââ, to whom she
was related, she confided to her the story which I now
give to the reader. But not being able to procure any
means of subsistence, and hearing that employment was
more likely to be had in Glasgow than any other place,
she resolved on going there, where, far from any one
who knew her, she might drag out a miserable existence:
and for this purpose she had taken her passage
in the vessel I intended to go with. I was introduced
to her by Mrs Lââ; but she shrunk from observation,
and seemed to feel uneasy at being observed. Seeing
this, I did not obtrude myself on her notice; but I
could not see her âpale wasted cheek, and brimfuâ eâe,
or hear her heart-bursting sighs,â without lamenting
over this wreck of human happiness.

The wind remaining contrary for two or three days,
I felt so uneasy that I determined on proceeding by
coach; but previous to doing so, I recommended Eliza
to the care of my friend Bââ, who was waiting his
passage by the same vessel, his term of service having
expired. The sequel, which I may as well relate here,
[Pg 326]

was communicated to me in a letter from him a few
days after my arrival at home:â

âTwo days after you left us, we sailed from Dublin
harbour, in company with two other vessels bound for
Glasgow. The wind being fair, we had ran down the
coast a good way before dark; but as the night came
on, the weather got hazy, and the wind veered more to
westward, blowing very fresh, and continued increasing:
by ten oâclock it was a perfect storm. All hands had
been on deck from the time it grew dark, and as we
had been rather pinched for room, the passengers
turned into the vacant berths; but I had never any
liking to being below in bad weather, and remained on
deck. The night looked frightfulâthe mist was such,
that we could not see the vesselâs length a-headâand
the wind blowing fearfully in upon the shore. The
captain had never been on the coast before, and seemed
to have no confidence in his knowledge of it, and in his
confusion lost sight of every precaution. I was well
aware of our danger, and mentioned it to the captain.
âI canât help it,â was his answer, âI can see no lightâto
lie-to, I would inevitably driftâand to tack with
this wind would be impossible; all I can do is to keep
the vessel close to the windâperhaps it may clear up.â
I saw there was little hope, and my mind turned to the
poor creatures in the cabin, who were lying sick in the
berths; if there was any chance for them, it must be on
deck, and going below for the purpose of getting them
up, I found Eliza in dreadful agony, the pains of premature
labour had seized her through excessive sickness.
I endeavoured to persuade her to come up, but she
could not stir. I overheard one of the sailors on deck
sing out that he saw a light. âThank God!â said I,
âwe may be saved yet.â âIs there danger?â said
Eliza. I could not conceal it. âYou had better try
to get up on deck, I will assist you; if you have any
chance of being saved it will be there.â âO, no!â
said she; âlet me remain, I do not wish to be saved;
God will have mercy on me, and the waves will cover
my shame!â Hearing a great bustle I ran up the
[Pg 327]

ladder,ââLord have mercy on us,â said one of the
sailors, âwe are all lost.â âHow? how?â said I.
âDonât you see the breakers a-head.â I did see them
too plainly: we were close upon them. I ran down
to the cabin, and partly by force, partly by entreaty,
got Eliza out of her berth; and getting her in my arms,
I got to the foot of the companion ladder. I was half-way
up the ladder, when a crash that would have
roused the dead pealed in my ear, mingled with the
despairing shriek of the crew. The shock threw me
back on the cabin floor, and my head coming in contact
with the iron ring of the hatch, I was rendered for
a few moments insensible. The stern of the vessel had
been torn asunder, and it now yawned beneath me;
the water rushed inâI remember no more. I was
saved, miraculously saved; but Eliza escaped from the
censure of an unfeeling world.â

Poor Eliza had indeed escaped from the censure of
the world; but her seducer still lives: if he is not lost
to every feeling, his remorse must be great. Poor
Bââ had a narrow escape with his life: when the
vessel went to pieces, he had clung to a piece of the
wreck, and was washed ashore on it; but he and one
of the crew were all that were saved.

CHAPTER XX.

MY FATHERâS LAST HOURS.

It was late at night when I reached Glasgow, and I
travelled on to my fatherâs house, my mind filled with
a fearful anxiety that he was not in life, and I knocked
at the door with a palpitating heartâa light beamed
across the hall windowâI heard a low moanâanotherâthen
my motherâs voice inquiring, âWho is there?â

âIt is me,â replied I.

The door openedââThank God,â said she, âthat
you have arrived, for your poor father has been
[Pg 328]

anxiously expecting you, and was beginning to despair
of seeing you before his eyes were closed for ever.â

âIs he so ill? Oh! let me see him.â

A hectic flush tinged her pale cheek, while she
motioned me to be silent, and leading me into another
roomââMy child,â said she, âyou may prepare yourself
for the worst, for little hope remains of his recovery.
He has been confined to bedâno, not to bed, for the
nature of his malady will not allow him to lie; but he
has sat in his arm-chair, with his head resting on a
pillow before him, for three weary monthsâno interval
of restâno cessation of pain; but he is calm and resigned,
no murmur passes his lips, and his only wish
is, that he may be permitted to see his child and die.
He is now so weak that I think it would be imprudent
for you to see him, without preparing him for the
meeting.â But her precautions were unavailingâhe
had heard my voice when I entered, and he now called
upon her. The next minute I was at his side, bedewing
his hand with my tearsâhe attempted to speak,
but his voice was choked in the utterance. I looked
up in his face, the hue of death was upon itâhe gasped
for breath, and fell back in his chair. The agony I
felt at that moment was indescribable, for I thought
he was dead. My mother having used the necessary
means for his recovery, a long low moan succeeded
her endeavours; he slowly unclosed his eyes, and she
motioned me to leave the room. When I next saw
him, he was prepared for the meeting; a flush of joy
animated his wasted features while he said, âMy dear
boy, I begged that I might see you once more before I
closed my eyes in death. That prayer has been granted:
I can now say, âLord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace.ââ

âAnd can you forgive all my folly and ingratitudeâforget
all the distress I have occasioned you?â

âForgive you? oh, yes! you little know a parentâs
feelings. But there is One whom you have offended,
whose pardon I hope you desire and askâOne who
delights to forgiveâah! cling to Him, my child, He
[Pg 329]

will never forsake you. I will soon have crossed âthat
bourne from whence no traveller returns.â In a short
time you will have no father; but it would smooth my
passage to the tomb, to think that you felt inclined to
throw yourself into the hands of the living God, and
beg his assistance to curb that unstable spirit, which
has caused you and us so much misery; and that we
shall yet meet, no wanderer lost, a family in heavenâthere
is joy in the thought.â

I felt my heart softened more than it had been in all
my misery; surely adversity is no tamer of the human
heartâat least, I never felt it so. I am of opinion that
it is calculated rather to draw forth the darker passions
of our nature, and shut up all the holy avenues of the
soul. I wished to sit up with my father that night,
but my mother urged me to retire to rest. I did so,
but I could not sleep; I lay ruminating on my past
life, and on my fatherâs situation, my mind stung with
remorse. I had learned that his distress of mind, when
I first went abroad, had been great, and that insensibly
his health had sunk, and that his disorder (which proved
eventually to be a cancer of the stomach) had been
lingering on him for some yearsâI therefore could not
but consider that I had contributed to the state he was
now in.

He grew rapidly worse; he was never satisfied
when I was out of his presence, and I generally sat up
with him at night. His malady caused him the most
excruciating pain, but he bore it with the greatest
patience and fortitude. He had always been remarkable
for his piety, but it was that unostentatious kind
of it which shows itself more in actions than words:
the world was receding from his view, but he did not
feel or feign those ecstasies which we often have described
in the obituary of religious people; his was an
humble confidence, alike removed from despondency
and presumption. It was remarkable that this gave
offence to some of his more enthusiastic brethren.
One, in particular, having called upon him, seemed to
feel disappointed that he was relating no heavenly
[Pg 330]

raptures or beatific visions, and very anxiously
endeavoured to draw him into some confession of this
kind.

âMy friend,â said my father, âyou seem disappointed
that I do not speak in certain and rapturous terms of my
future state; but if we consider that when we have done
our utmost, we are but unprofitable servants, we ought to
beware of presumption, and not give the reins to a wild
imagination, on the verge of a solemn eternity, and on
the point of entering the presence of the Judge of all
the earth. I feel a confidence in my Almighty CreatorâI
know he is a God of truth, and I rely on his promiseâI
know he is a God of love and mercy, and I
have given up my all into his hands; more than this I
dare not say.â

The stranger felt reproved, and urged the subject no
farther.

All his affairs had been previously settledâhe
arranged every particular concerning his funeral, and
counselled me on my conduct after his decease, with
the utmost calmness; but I could not listen to it,
although I was persuaded that he would not recover:
there was something so heart-rending, and to me so
premature, in the contemplation of his death, that I
could not bring myself to reply to any of his suggestions.

He was now near his end; but the more his body
wasted, his intellect grew clearerâhis soul seemed to
wax strong in the anticipation of its freedom, and
rejoice in the prospect of shuffling off its mortal coil.

It was nearly three weeks since I had returned home;
my mother and I were sitting beside him, when he
expressed a wish to lie down in his bed. This he had
attempted before I came home, but from the excessive
pain it produced, he was obliged to abandon the idea.
He now, however, felt assured that he could lie, and
we carried him to the bed, but it was in vain;
the horizontal posture caused him such agony that
we were obliged to raise him, when he fainted in
our arms. I thought he was deadâwe placed him on
[Pg 331]

a sofaâhe recoveredâone bright flash of intellect
pervaded his featuresâfor a few minutes he seemed as
if perfectly well; and observing us weeping, he was
surprised, and asked the reason. He appeared neither
to feel pain, nor to remember that he had felt any; a
gleam of hope shot across our minds that he might yet
recover.âAh no! his soul was on the threshold,
pluming her wing for an eternal flight!âShe fledâthe
celestial fire that animated his features, gave place
to the cold damp of deathâhis lip quiveredâone
convulsive gasp, and he was no more!

The day arrived on which I was to follow my
fatherâs remains to the tomb. A torpid feeling had
pervaded my mind since his death, nor did I feel any
of those emotions which people in such circumstances
are said to feelâhe was even consigned to the grave,
and the last sod smoothed over it, and yet I waked
not to sensibility. When I returned home, our relations
and friends were assembled, and although there
was much commonplace expression of grief, and just
encomiums passed on his character as a man and a
Christian, still my heart was like a fountain sealed up.
The last friend had departed, and I sat on the sofa on
which my father had breathed his last, absorbed in the
same melancholy stupor. The day had been stormy,
and the pattering rain dashed against the windows,
while the wind, sweeping along in sullen gusts, whistled
through the casement, now wild and irregularânow
low and mournful! There was something in this that
struck a kindred chord within my bosom, and melted
my whole soul. Oh! there are answering tones in
nature, responsive to every feeling of humanity, from
the light note of gladness, to the dying accents of
despair!

I awakened, as it were, from a dream, to all that
desolateness of heart, which those only who have felt
can understand, and looking round the room, became
conscious that I was alone in every sense of the wordâbereft
of my best friendâhe who had centred all his
[Pg 332]

care and solicitude in meâhe whom I had repaid with
ingratitudeâhe who, had he lived, would have been
my director and friend, was gone for ever, and I was
left alone in the world, âa wretch unfitted with an
aim.â

It was my fatherâs wish that I should procure my
discharge, and settle at home in some business, to
which I was by no means averse: I therefore lost no
time in taking the necessary step for that purpose,
and procured my freedom. Previous to my being
emancipated, I had looked forward to the event as the
consummation of all my wishes. I thought that when
I could once breathe freely, all other good things
would follow, and I indulged in many Utopian dreams;
but when the much desired object was accomplished, I
found myself surrounded by difficulties. I had gone
into the army a mere boy, my service had been principally
abroad. The life of a soldier is not one where
people learn worldly wisdom, and I now felt myself
as much a child in that respect, as when I first
left my native home to seek for reputation in the
wars.

I was acquainted with no business to which I could
turn my attention, and I endeavoured to procure a
situation of some kind; but here my boyish sins and
military life were visited upon me. The cool calculating
people of my native city felt no inclination to
employ one who had manifested so much unsteadiness
in his early days; and besides this, they considered an
individual who had been in the army the very
worst person they could employâthey were all lazy,
good-for-nothing fellows; in short, there exists an
insurmountable objection to such menâthe moral
character of the individual is nothingâhe has been
guilty of being in the army, and that is sufficient.
My fatherâs arrangements in my favour, that might
have secured me against these evils, were set aside, for
want of some formality of law, and my bark was thrown
on the ocean of life, to be driven along by the current,
[Pg 333]

without compass or chart to guide its courseâHe
who would have been my pilot,

ââ had reachâd the shore,

Where tempests never beat, nor billows roar

My own efforts were of little avail to combat the
difficulties that I had to encounter. My fatherâs friends
and acquaintances, remembering all my childish follies,
and the greater number of them being dull, thorough-paced
men of business, whose blood had glided through
its icy channel in the same even current from the time
they came into the world, could not believe that a
warm imagination might lead a boy astray from the
path of prudence, without his heart being depraved.
They saw nothing in me but the blackguard boy, who
had ran away from his parents; and they rung eternal
cautions in my ears, accompanied by wise shakes of the
head, and doubts lavishly expressed of my steadiness.
They could ill dissemble the thorough contempt they
had for my capacity for business: no wonder, they had
all outstripped me in the necessary qualifications of
chicanery and selfishnessâI acted from natural impulse,
and often wrong; but it was myself that sufferedâthey
acted systematically, their eyes fixed steadily on
their own interest, ready to take advantage of the follies
of those around them. I speak from experience. I
have found individuals who hypocritically deplored my
want of wisdom, while in the act of taking advantage
of my folly: while others, on the pretence of caring for
my soulâs salvation, wished to embue my mind with
their religious prejudices, and cramp my conscience
within the narrow bounds marked out by their particular
sect; and when I claimed a right to think for
myself on these matters, they shunned me as a reprobate,
or decried me as an infidel. I have found many
things to disgust me in my passage through life; but
never anything equal to the hypocritical cant of many
professing sectarians.

Thus, as it were, cut off from society, and my place
[Pg 334]

filled up in it, I did not possess the necessary courage
to force through these difficulties, and I remained in an
undecided state for some time. My manners had not
been framed in the worldâs school, and I felt all that

mauvaise honte
that people of a sensitive mind generally
feel in such a situation, which, along with a proud
feeling that caught fire at the slightest look, or word
indicative of contempt, rendered my progress in the
world almost a thing impossible.

This feeling induced me to decline the assistance
of those who wished to afford me an opportunity of
mixing with it, and I retired within myself, unknowing
and unknown, affecting to feel contempt for those
whom I was afraid to mix with. I was in danger of
sinking into a complete misanthrope, and I confined
myself so much to the house and my books, that my
health began to be impaired. My mother, seeing the
apathy and torpid state into which I was fast sinking,
endeavoured to arouse me to some exertion, and her
arguments had so much effect, that it made me resolve
to try some business; but nothing could induce me
to do so in Glasgow. I accordingly set about removing
to a different part of the countryâembarked
in a business that I knew nothing aboutâneglected
all the necessary caution which a more intimate
knowledge of the world would have taught meâbecame
the dupe of those who chose to take the
trouble to deceive meâlooked forward to results
without calculating the intermediate steps, and in a
short time had the pleasure of being as poor as ever.
But here let me pay a tribute of gratitude to individuals,
who, in a strange place, came generously
forward with their advice and purse to assist me,
when I needed assistanceâwho, though truly religious
people, did not ask me, before they offered it, what
church I sat in, or what my early life had been.âThe
effects of my ignorance of business could not then be
rectified; but I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance
of their disinterested goodness.

[Pg 335]

It is useless to go through all the circumstances that
induced me to resume the uniform of a soldier; suffice
it to say, that it was the result. My only consolation
now is, that in spite of my folly, and the untoward
circumstances which have occasionally thwarted my
passage through life, I can look back on my errors
with a conviction that they were more of the head
than the heart.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE

The publication of this book may most conveniently be explained by a
short account of the circumstances which brought it about.

While engaged some years ago in studying the Chaucer manuscripts in
the Bodleian Library, I incidentally turned my attention also to those
of the
Confessio Amantis
. The unsatisfactory character of the
existing editions of that poem was sufficiently well known, and it
was generally recognized that the printed text could not safely be
referred to by philologists, except so far as those small portions were
concerned which happened to have been published from a good manuscript
by Mr. A. J. Ellis in his
Early English Pronunciation
; so that,
in spite of the acknowledged importance of the book in the history
of the development of standard literary English, it was practically
useless for linguistic studies. I was struck by the excellence of
the authorities for its text which existed at Oxford, and on further
investigation I convinced myself that it was here that the much needed
new edition could best be produced. Accordingly I submitted to the
Delegates of the University Press a proposal to edit the
Confessio
Amantis
, and this proposal they accepted on the condition that I
would undertake to edit also the other works, chiefly in French and
Latin, of the same author, expressly desiring that the
Speculum
Meditantis
, which I had lately identified
[Pg vi]
while searching the
Cambridge libraries for copies of the
Confessio Amantis
, should
be included in the publication. To this condition I assented with some
hesitation, which was due partly to my feeling that the English text
was the only one really needed, and partly to doubts about my own
competence to edit the French.

Considering, however, the extent to which the writings of this author
in various languages illustrate one another, the help which is to be
derived from the French works in dealing with the Romance element in
the English not only of Gower, but also of Chaucer and other writers
of the time, and the clearer view of the literary position of the

Confessio Amantis
which is gained by approaching it from the
French side, I am now disposed to think that the Delegates were
right in desiring a complete edition; and as for my own competence
as an editor, I can only say that I have learnt much since I first
undertook the work, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I
have avoided many errors into which I should once have fallen. For
the faults that remain (I speak now of the contents of the present
volume) I ask the indulgence of those who are more competent Romance
scholars than myself, on the ground that it was clearly desirable
under the circumstances that the French and the English should have
the same editor. Moreover, I may fairly claim to have given faithful
and intelligible texts, and if I have gone wrong in other respects, it
has been chiefly because I have wished to carry out the principle of
dealing with all difficulties fairly, rather than passing them over
without notice.

The English works will occupy the second and third volumes of this
edition. From what has been said it will be understood that to publish
a correct text of the
Confessio Amantis
has been throughout
the main object. For this the materials are so excellent, though
hitherto almost completely neglected, that we may with some confidence
claim that the work is now presented almost exactly as it left the
hand of the author, and that a higher degree of
[Pg vii]
security has been
attained about the details of form and orthography than is possible
(for example) in regard to any part of the writings of Chaucer. It
is evident, if this be so, that the text must have a considerable
value for students of Middle English, and none the less because it is
here accompanied by a complete glossary. Besides this, the meaning
of the text has been made clear, where necessary, by explanation and
illustration, and above all by improved punctuation, and the sources of
the stories and the literary connexions of the work generally have been
traced as far as possible.

In the edition of the
Vox Clamantis
, which with the other Latin
Works will form the fourth volume of this edition, the most important
new contribution, besides the account of the various manuscripts, is
perhaps the view presented of the authorâs political development,
as shown in the successive variations of the text. The historical
references generally, both in this work and in the
Cronica
Tripertita
, have been compared with the accounts given of the same
events by other contemporary writers. This volume will also contain a
statement of such facts as it is possible to gather with regard to the
life of the author.

To a great extent this edition breaks fresh ground, and there are
unfortunately but few direct obligations to be acknowledged to former
workers in precisely the same field. At the same time the very greatest
help is afforded to the editor of Gower by the work that has been done
upon Chaucer and other fourteenth-century writers both by societies and
individuals, work for which in this country Dr. Furnivall and Professor
Skeat, and on the Continent Professor ten Brink, are perhaps most
largely responsible.

Much of my work has been done in the Bodleian Library and with Bodleian
manuscripts, and I should like to acknowledge the courtesy which I have
always received there from the Librarian. My thanks are also due to
the Librarians of those Colleges, both at Oxford and Cambridge, which
possess Gower manuscripts, and to Dr. Young of the Hunterian Museum,
Glasgow, for the trouble which
[Pg viii]
they have taken in giving me facilities
for the use of their books, and especially to the Cambridge University
Librarian, Mr. Jenkinson, for assistance of various kinds in connexion
with the manuscript of the
Mirour de lâOmme
. I am obliged to the
Provost and Fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, for the loan of their
manuscript of the
Vox Clamantis
, and to several private owners,
the Duke of Sutherland, the Marquess of Salisbury, the Marquess of
Bute, the Earl of Ellesmere, Lord Middleton, and J. H. Gurney, Esq.,
for having allowed me to make use of their manuscripts.

Finally, my thanks are due to the Delegates of the Oxford University
Press for having undertaken the publication of a book which can hardly
be very profitable, and for the consideration which they have shown for
me in the course of my work.

INTRODUCTION

From a statement in Latin which is found in many of the Gower
manuscripts, and undoubtedly proceeds from the author himself, we learn
that the poet desired to rest his fame upon three principal works,
the first in French, the second in Latin, and the third in English.
These are the three volumes which, lying one upon another, form a
pillow for the poetâs effigy in the church of Saint Saviour, Southwark,
where he was buried. They are known by the Latin names,
Speculum
Meditantis
,
Vox Clamantis
,
Confessio Amantis
, but
the first of the three has until recently been looked upon as lost.
In addition there are minor poems in each of the three languages,
among which are two series of French balades. It will be my duty
afterwards to prove the identity of the
Mirour de lâOmme
printed
in this volume with our authorâs earliest principal work, commonly
known as
Speculum Meditantis
, but named originally
Speculum
Hominis
; in the mean time I shall ask leave to assume this as
proved, in order that a general view may be taken of Gowerâs French
writings before we proceed to the examination of each particular work.

The Anglo-Norman
[A]
literature, properly so called, can hardly
[Pg xii]
be
said to extend beyond the limits of the fourteenth century, and these
therefore are among its latest productions. The interest of this
literature in itself and its importance with a view to the Romance
element in the English language have been adequately recognized within
recent years, though the number of literary texts printed is still
too small. It is unnecessary therefore to do more here than to call
attention to the special position occupied by the works published in
this volume, and the interest attaching to them, first on their own
merits, then on account of the period to which they belong and the
author from whom they proceed, and lastly from the authenticity and
correctness of the manuscripts which supply us with their text.

As regards the work which occupies the greater part of the present
volume, it would be absurd to claim for it a high degree of literary
merit, but it is nevertheless a somewhat noticeable and interesting
performance. The all-embracing extent of its design, involving a
complete account not only of the moral nature of Man, but of the
principles of Godâs dealings with the world and with the human race,
is hardly less remarkable than the thoroughness with which the scheme
is worked out in detail and the familiarity with the Scriptures which
the writer constantly displays. He has a far larger conception of his
subject as a whole than other authors of âSpeculaâ or classifiers
of Vices and Virtues which the age produced. Compare the
Mirour
de lâOmme
with such works as the
Speculum Vitae
or the

Manuel des Pechiez
, and we shall be struck not only with the
greater unity of its plan, but also with its greater comprehensiveness,
while at the same time, notwithstanding its oppressive lengthiness, it
has in general a flavour of literary style to which most other works
of the same class can lay no claim. Though intended, like the rest,
for edification, it does not aim at edification alone: by the side
of the moralist there is occasionally visible also a poet. This was
the work upon which Gowerâs reputation rested when Chaucer submitted

Troilus
to his judgement, and
[Pg xiii]
though he may have been indulging
his sense of humour in making Gower one of the correctors of his
version of thatâ

âgeste

De TroÃ¿lus et de la belle

Creseide,â

which the moralist had thought only good enough for the indolent
worshipper to dream of in church (
Mir.
5253), yet the dedication
must have been in part at least due to respect for the literary taste
of the persons addressed.

If however we must on the whole pronounce the literary value of the

Speculum Meditantis
to be small, the case is quite different
with regard to the
Balades
, that is to say, the collection of
about fifty love-poems which is found in the Trentham manuscript.
These will be discussed in detail later, and reasons will be given for
assigning them to the later rather than to the earlier years of the
poetâs life. Here it is enough to say that they are for the most part
remarkably good, better indeed than anything of their kind which was
produced in England at that period, and superior in my opinion to the
balades of Granson, âflour of hem that make in France,â some of which
Chaucer translated. But for the accident that they were written in
French, this series of balades would have taken a very distinct place
in the history of English literature.

The period to which the
Speculum Meditantis
belongs, about the
beginning of the last quarter of the fourteenth century, is that in
which the fusion of French and English elements from which the later
language grew may be said to have been finally accomplished. Thanks to
the careful work of English and German philologists in recent years,
the process by which French words passed into the English language
in the period from the beginning of the thirteenth to the end of the
fourteenth century has been sufficiently traced, so far as regards the
actual facts of their occurrence in English texts. Perhaps however
the real nature of the process has not been set forth with sufficient
clearness. It is true that before the end of the reign of Edward III
the French element may be said to have been almost fully introduced
into the vocabulary; the materials lay ready for those writers, the
Wycliffite translators of the Bible, Chaucer, and Gower himself, who
were to give the stamp of their authority to the language which was
to be the literary language of England. Nevertheless, French words
were still French for these writers,
[Pg xiv]
and not yet English; the fact
that the two languages were still used side by side, and that to
every Englishman of literary culture the form of French which existed
in England was as a second mother tongue, long preserved a French
citizenship for the borrowed words. In the earlier part of this period
they came in simply as aliens, and their meaning was explained when
they were used, âin
desperaunce
, that is in unhope and in
unbileave,â âtwo
manere temptaciuns
, two kunne vondungesâ; and
afterwards for long, even though they had been repeatedly employed by
English writers, they were not necessarily regarded as English words,
but when wanted they were usually borrowed again from the original
source, and so had their phonetic development in French rather than in
English. When therefore Anglo-Norman forms are to be cited for English
etymology, it is evidently more reasonable that the philologist should
look to the latter half of the fourteenth century and give the form
in which the word finally passed into the literary language, than to
the time of the first appearance of the word in English, under a form
corresponding perhaps to the Anglo-Norman of the thirteenth century,
but different from that which it assumed in the later Anglo-Norman,
and thence in English. More precision in these citations is certainly
to be desired, even though the time be past when etymologists were
content to refer us vaguely to âOld French,â meaning usually the
sixteenth-century French of Cotgrave, when the form really required was
of the fourteenth century and Anglo-Norman. It is not unreasonable to
lay down the rule that for words of Anglo-Norman origin which occur in
the English literary language of the Chaucer period, illustration of
forms and meanings must first be looked for in the Anglo-Norman texts
of that period, since the standard writers, as we may call them, that
is those who contributed most to fix the standard of the language, in
using them had the Anglo-Norman of their own day before their minds and
eyes rather than any of the obscure English books in various dialects,
where the words in question may have been already used to supply the
defects of a speech which had lost its literary elements. Moreover,
theories as to the pronunciation of the English of Chaucerâs day have
been largely supported by reference to the supposed pronunciation of
the French words imported into English and the manner in which they are
used in rhyme.
[Pg xv]
Evidently in this case the reference ought to be to the
Anglo-Norman speech of this particular period, in the form in which it
was used by those writers of English to whose texts we refer.

But this is not all: beside the question of language there is one
of literary history. At the beginning of the fourteenth century
Anglo-Norman literature had sunk into a very degraded condition. Pierre
de Peccham, William of Waddington, Pierre de Langtoft, and the authors
of the
Apocalypse
and the
Descente de Saint Paul
make the
very worst impression as versifiers upon their modern French critics,
and it must be allowed that the condemnation is just. They have in
fact lost their hold on all the principles of French verse, and their
metres are merely English in a French dress. Moreover, the English
metres which they resemble are those of the North rather than of the
South. If we compare the octosyllables of the
Manuel des Pechiez

with those of the
Prick of Conscience
we shall see that their
principle is essentially the same, that of half-lines with two accents
each, irrespective of the number of unaccented syllables, though
naturally in English the irregularity is more marked. The same may be
said of Robert Grossetesteâs verse a little earlier than this, e.g.

âDeu nus doint de li penser,

De ky, par ki, en ki sunt

Trestuz li biens ki al mund sunt,

Deu le pere et deu le fiz

Et deu le seint esperiz,

Persones treis en trinitÃ©

E un sul deu en unitÃ©,

Sanz fin et sanz comencement,â &c.

It cannot be proved that all the writers of French whom I have named
were of the North, but it is certain that several of them were so,
and it may well be that the French used in England was not really so
uniform, âunivoca,â as it seemed to Higden, or at least that as the
South of England had more metrical regularity in its English verse,
witness the octosyllables of
The Owl and the Nightingale
in the
thirteenth century, so also it retained more formal correctness in its
French. However that may be, and whether it were by reason of direct
continental influence or of the literary traditions of the South of
England, it is certain that Gower represents a different school of
versification from that of the writers whom we have mentioned, though
he uses the same (or nearly the same) Anglo-Norman dialect, and writes
[Pg xvi]

verse which, as we shall see, is quite distinguishable in rhythm from
that of the Continent. Thus we perceive that by the side of that
reformation of English verse which was effected chiefly by Chaucer,
there is observable a return of Anglo-Norman verse to something of
its former regularity, and this in the hands of the very man who has
commonly been placed by the side of Chaucer as a leader of the new
school of English poetry.

In what follows I shall endeavour to indicate those points connected
with versification and language which are suggested by a general view
of Gowerâs French works. Details as to his management of particular
metres are reserved for consideration in connexion with the works in
which they occur.

Gowerâs metre, as has already been observed, is extremely regular. He
does not allow himself any of those grosser licences of suppression or
addition of syllables which have been noticed in Anglo-Norman verse
of the later period. Like William of Waddington, he apologizes for
his style on the ground that he is an Englishman, but in his case the
plea is very much less needed. His rhyming also, after allowance has
been made for a few well-established Anglo-Norman peculiarities, may
be said to be remarkably pure, more so in some respects than that of
FrÃ¨re Angier, for example, who wrote at least a century and a half
earlier and was a decidedly good versifier. It is true that, like
other Anglo-Norman writers, he takes liberties with the forms of words
in flexion in order to meet the requirements of his rhyme, but these
must be regarded as sins against grammar rather than against rhyme,
and the French language in England had long been suffering decadence
in this respect. Moreover, when we come to examine these vagaries, we
shall find that they are by no means so wild in his case as they had
been in that of some other writers, and that there is a good deal of
method in the madness. The desired effect is attained principally by
two very simple expedients. The first of these is a tolerably extensive
disregard of gender, adjectives being often used indifferently in the
masculine or the feminine form, according to convenience. Thus in the

Balades
[B]
we have âchose
humein
â xxiv. 3, but âtoute
autre chose est
veine
â xxxiii. 2, âma fortune
[Pg xvii]
est
assis
â
ix. 5, âla fortune est
faili
â xx. 3, âcorps
humeine
â xiv.
1, âlâestÃ©e vient
flori
â ii. 1, âlâestÃ©e beal
flori
â
xx. 2, but âLa cliere estÃ©eâ xxxii. 2, and the author says â
ce

(
ceo
) lettreâ (ii. 4, iii. 4), or â
ceste
lettreâ (xv. 4),
according as it suits his metre. Similarly in the
Mirour
l. 92
ff.,

âSiqâen apres de celle issue,

Que de leur corps serroit
estrait
,

Soit restorÃ© qâestoit
perdue
â &c.,

for
estraite
,
perdu
, l. 587
hony
for
honie
,
719 âla Char
humein
,â 911
replenis
for
replenies
,
1096 âdeinz son cuer
maliciouse
.â From the use of
du
,

au
by our author nothing must be inferred about gender,
since they are employed indifferently for the masculine or feminine
combination, as well as for the simple prepositions
de
,

Ã
; and such forms as
celestial
, in
Bal. Ded.
i.
1,
cordial
,
enfernals
,
mortals
,
Mir.
717,
1011, 1014, are perhaps reminiscences of the older usage, though the
inflected feminine is also found. The question of the terminations

Ã©
,
Ã©e
will be dealt with separately.

No doubt the feeling for gender had been to some extent worn away in
England; nevertheless the measure in which this affects our authorâs
language is after all rather limited. A much more wide-reaching
principle is that which has to do with the ârule of
s
.â The
old System of French noun inflexion had already been considerably
broken up on the Continent, and it would not have been surprising if
in England it had altogether disappeared. In some respects however
Anglo-Norman was rather conservative of old forms, and our author is
not only acquainted with the rule, but often shows a preference for
observing it, where it is a matter of indifference in other respects.
Rhyme however must be the first consideration, and a great advantage is
obtained by the systematic combination of the older and the newer rule.
Thus the poet has it in his power either to use or to omit the
s

of inflexion in the nominatives singular and plural of masculine nouns,
according as his rhymes may require, and a few examples will show what
use he makes of this licence. In
Bal. Ded.
i. 3 he describes
himself as

âVostre Gower, qâest trestout
vos soubgitz
,â

but in rhyme with this the same form of inflexion stands for the plural
subject, âu sont les
ditz floriz
,â and in xxvi. 1 he gives
us nearly the same expression, âqâest tout vostre
soubgit
,â
without
[Pg xviii]
the inflexion. So in iv. 3 we have âcome
tes loials
amis
â (sing. nom.), but in the very same balade â
ton ami

serrai,â while in
Trait.
iii. 3 we have the further development
of
s
in the oblique case of the singular, âLoiale amie avoec

loials amis
.â In
Bal.
xviii. 1
menu
is apparently
fem. pl. for
menues
, while
avenu
, rhyming with it,
is nom. sing. masc.; but so also are
conuz
,
retenuz
,

venuz
, in xxxix, while
veeuz
is sing. object., and in
the phrase âtout bien sont
contenuz
â there is a combination
of the uninflected with the inflected form in the plural of the
subject. Similarly in the
Mirour
we have
principals
,

desloyals
, ll. 63, 70, as nom. sing., and so
governals
,

desloyals
627, 630, but
espirital
709,
principal
,

Emperial
, 961 ff., are forms used elsewhere for the same. Again
as nom. sing. we have
rejoÃ¯z
462,
ruez
,
honourez
,

malurez
544 ff., &c., and as nom. plur.
enamourÃ©

17,
retornÃ©
792,
mariÃ©
(f) 1010,
nÃ©e
1017,

malurÃ©
1128,
il
25064; but also
enamourÃ©

220,
privÃ©
496,
menÃ©
785, &c., as nom. singular,
and
perturbez
,
tuez
, 3639 ff.,
travaillez
,

abandonnez
, 5130 ff., as nom. plural: âce dist
ly sage
â
1586, but âil est
nounsages
â 1754, and â
Ly sages
distâ
3925,
ly soverein
76, but
ly capiteins
4556, and so
on. We also note occasionally forms like that cited above from the

TraitiÃ©
, where the
s
(or
z
) of the termination
has no grammatical justification at all; e.g.
enginez
552,

confondus
1904, âfort et
halteins
â (obj.) 13024, cp.

offenduz
,
Bal.
xxxix. 2, and cases where the rules which
properly apply to masculine nouns only are extended to feminines, as
in
perdice
(pl.) 7831,
humilitÃ©s
,
pitÃ©s
(sing.),
12499, 13902.

Besides these two principal helps to rhyme the later Anglo-Norman
versifier might occasionally fall back upon others. In so artificial
a language as that in which he wrote, evidently the older forms of
inflexion might easily be kept up for literary purposes in verbs also,
and used side by side with the later. Thus in the 1st pers. pl. of
the present tense we find
lison
(
lisoun
) repeatedly in
rhyme, and occasionally other similar forms, as
soion
18480.
The 1st pers. sing. of the present tense of several strong verbs is
inflected with or without
s
at pleasure: thus from
dire

we have
di
,
dy
, as well as
dis
;
faire
gives

fai
or
fais
; by the side of
suis
(sum),
sui

or
suy
is frequently found; and similarly we have
croy
,

say
,
voi
. In the same part of first-conjugation
verbs the atonic final
e
is often dropped, as
pri
,

appell
,
mir
,
mâesmai
,
suppli
. In the
third person singular of
[Pg xix]
the preterite of
i
verbs there is a
variation in the ending between
-it
(
-ist
) and
-i

(
-y
). Thus in one series of rhymes we have
nasquit
,

sâesjoÃ¯t
(in rhyme with
dit
, &c.), 268 ff., in another

sâesjoÃ¿
,
chery
,
servi
(in rhyme with
y
),
427 ff.; in one stanza
fuÃ¿t
,
partist
, 11416 ff., and
in the next
respondi
, 11429; so
chaÃ¯t
(
chaÃ¯st
)
and
chaÃ¿
,
obeÃ¯t
and
obeÃ¯
, &c. It may be doubted
also whether such words as
tesmoignal
,
surquidance
,

presumement
,
bestial
(as subst.),
relinquir
, &c.,
owe their existence to any better cause than the requirements of rhyme
or metre. In introducing
ent
, 11471, for the usual
en

the poet has antiquity on his side: on the other hand when he writes

a
repeatedly in rhyme for the Anglo-Norman
ad
(which,
except in these cases, is regularly used) he is no doubt looking
towards the âFrench of Paris,â which naturally tended to impose itself
on the English writers of French in the fourteenth century. By the
same rule he can say either
houre
or
heure
,
flour

or
fleur
,
crestre
or
croistre
,
crere
or

croire
; but on the whole it is rather surprising how little his
language seems to have been affected by this influence.

The later Anglo-Norman treatment of the terminations
-Ã©
and

-Ã©e
in past participles and in verbal substantives would seem
to demand notice chiefly in connexion with rhyme and metre, but it
is really a question of phonology. The two terminations, as is well
known, became identified before the beginning of the fourteenth
century, and it is needless to quote examples to show that in Gowerâs
metre and rhymes
-Ã©e
was equivalent to
-Ã©
. The result
of this phonetic change, consisting in the absorption of the atonic
vowel by the similar tonic which immediately preceded it, was that

-Ã©
and
-Ã©e
were written indiscriminately in almost
all words with this ending, and that the distinction between the
masculine and feminine forms was lost completely in pronunciation and
to a very great extent also in writing. For example in
Mir.

865 ff. we have rhyming together
degrÃ©
,
montÃ©
(fem.),

muÃ©
,
descolourÃ©
(fem.),
enbroudÃ©
,
poudrÃ©

(fem. plur.); in 1705 ff. there is a series of rhymes in
-Ã©e
,

bealpinÃ©e
,
engalopÃ©e
,
assemblÃ©e
,
ascoultÃ©e

(pl.),
malsenÃ©e
,
doublÃ©e
, all masculine except the
substantive
assemblÃ©e
; and in other stanzas the endings are
mixed up anyhow, so that we have
aisnÃ©e
,
malurÃ©
, 244 f.,
both feminine,
menÃ©
,
hÃ©ritÃ©e
, 922 f., the first feminine
and the second masculine,
ymaginÃ©e
,
adrescÃ©e
,
Bal.

vi, both masculine. In all Gowerâs
[Pg xx]
French verse I can recall only
three or four instances where an atonic final
e
of this kind is
counted in the metre: these are
a lÃ©e chiere
,
ove lÃ©e

(
liÃ©e
)
chiere
,
du lÃ©e port
[C]
,
Mir.

5179, 15518, 17122, 28337, and
Et ta pensÃ©e celestine
29390.
In the last the author perhaps wrote
penseie
, as in 14404,
since the condition under which the sound of this
-e
survived
in Anglo-Norman was usually through the introduction of a parasitic

i
-sound, which acted as a barrier to prevent the absorption of
the final vowel
[D]
. So
Mir.
10117 we have a word
pareies
,
in rhyme with the substantives
pareies
(walls),
veies
,
&c., which I take to be for
parÃ©es
, fem. plur. of the
participle, and in the same stanza
journeies
, a modification of

journÃ©es
: cp.
valeie
,
journeie
, in Middle English.

I proceed to note such further points of the Phonology as seem to be of
interest.

i. French
e
,
ie
, from Lat.
a
,
Ä
, in tonic
syllables.

The French diphthong
ie
, from Lat.
a
under the
influence of preceding sound and from
Ä
, was gradually reduced
in Anglo-Norman to
áº¹
(i.e. close
e
). Thus, while in
the earliest writers
ie
is usually distinguished in rhyme
from
e
, those of the thirteenth century no longer keep them
apart. In the
Vie de S. Auban
and the writings of FrÃ¨re
Angier the distinction between verbs in
-er
and those in

-ier
has been, at least to a great extent, lost: infinitives
and participles, &c., such as
enseign(i)er
,
bris(i)er
,

eshauc(i)er
,
mang(i)er
,
jug(i)Ã©
,
less(i)Ã©
,

dresc(i)Ã©
,
sach(i)ez
, and substantives such as

cong(i)Ã©
,
pecch(i)Ã©
, rhyme with those which have the
(French) termination,
-er
,
-Ã©
,
-ez
. At the same
time the noun termination
-ier
comes to be frequently written

-er
, as in
aumosner
,
chevaler
,
dener
,

seculer
, &c. (beside
aumosnier
,
chevalier
,

denier
,
seculier
), and words which had
ie
in the
stem were often written with
e
, as
bref
,
chef
,

cher
,
pere
(petram),
sÃ©
, though the other forms

brief
,
chief
,
chier
,
piere
,
siÃ©
,
still continued to be used as alternatives in spelling
[E]
. It is
certain that in the fourteenth century no practical distinction was
made between
[Pg xxi]
the two classes of verbs that have been indicated:
whether written
-ier
,
-iÃ©
,
-iez
, or
-er
,

-Ã©
,
-ez
, the verbal endings of which we have spoken
rhymed freely with one another and with the similar parts of all
verbs of the first conjugation, and the infinitives and past
participles of all first-conjugation verbs rhymed with substantives
ending in
-(i)er
,
-(i)Ã©
,
-Ã©
: thus

pecchÃ©
,
enamourÃ©
,
commencÃ©
,
bestialitÃ©
,

Mir.
16 ff.,
resemblÃ©
,
chargÃ©
,
saintetÃ©
,
1349,
corouciÃ©
,
piÃ©e
,
degrÃ©
, 5341, are good
sets of rhymes, and so also are
deliter
,
seculer
,

plenier
, 27 ff.,
coroucer
,
parler
,
mestier
,

seculier
,
considerer
, 649 ff., and
leger
,

archer
,
amender
,
comparer
, 2833 ff. The case
is the same with words which have the original (French)
ie

in the stem, but notwithstanding the fact that the diphthong sound
must have disappeared, the traditional spelling
ie
held
its ground by the side of the other, and even extended itself to
some words which had never had the diphthong sound at all. Thus
in the fourteenth century, and noticeably in Gowerâs works, we
meet with such forms as
clier
,
clief
,
mier

(mare),
miere
(matrem),
piere
(patrem),
pier

(parem),
prophiete
,
tiel
, &c., beside the normal
forms
cler
,
clef
,
mer
,
mere
, &c. This
phenomenon, which has caused some difficulty, is to be accounted
for by the supposition that
ie
, having lost its value as
a diphthong, came to be regarded as a traditional symbol in many
cases for long closed
e
, and such words as rhymed on this
sound were apt to become assimilated in spelling with those that
originally had
ie
and partly preserved it; thus
tel

in rhyme with
ciel
,
fiel
, might easily come to be
written
tiel
, as
Mir.
6685;
clere
,
pere
,
rhyming with
maniere
,
adversiere
, &c., might be written

cliere
,
piere
, as in
Mir.
193 ff., merely for
the sake of uniformity, and similarly
nef
when in rhyme
with
ch(i)ef
,
relief
, &c., sometimes
might take the form
nief
; and finally these spellings might
become established independently, at least as alternatives, so
that it was indifferent whether
labourer
,
seculer
,

bier
, or
labourier
,
seculier
,
ber
,
stood as a rhyme sequence, whether
clere
,
appere
was
written or
cliere
,
appiere
. It may be noted that

pere
,
mere
,
frere
, belonged to this class and
were rhymed with
áº¹
. They are absolutely separated in rhyme
from
terre
,
guerre
,
enquere
,
affere
,

contrere
, &c. The adjective ending
-el
rhymes with

-iel
and often appears as
-iel
: so in 3733 ff. we
have the rhymes
mortiel
,
Michel
,
fraternel
,

viel
, in 6685 ff.,
desnaturel
,
ciel
,
fiel
,

espiritiel
, and in 14547 ff.
celestiel
,
mortiel
,

ciel
,
temporiel
, &c. Questions have been raised about
the quality of the
e
in this termination
[Pg xxii]
generally
[F]
, but
the evidence here is decidedly in favour of
áº¹
, and the rhymes

bel
,
apell
,
flaiell
, are kept apart from this
class. It must be observed however that
fel
(adj.), spelt
also
feel
, appears in both classes, 4773, 5052. The variation

-al
, which, as might be expected, is extremely common, is of
course from Latin and gives no evidence as to the sound of
-el
,
from which it is quite separate in rhyme. Before a nasal in verbs
like
vient
,
tient
,
ie
is regularly retained in
writing, and these words and their compounds rhyme among one another
and with
crient
,
ghient
,
nient
,
fient
,
&c. Naturally they are separated from the
Ä
of
aprent
,

commencement
,
sagement
, &c. The forms
ben
,

men
,
ren
, which occur for example in the
Vie de
S. GrÃ©goire
for
bien
,
mien
,
rien
, are not
found in Gower. Finally it may be noticed that beside
fiere
,

appiere
,
compiere
, from
ferir
,
apparer
,
&c., we have
fere
,
appere
,
compere
, which in
rhyme are as absolutely separated from
fere
(=
faire
),

terre
,
requere
(inf.), as
fiert
,
piert
,

quiert
, &c., are from
apert
,
overt
,
pert
.
More will have to be said on the subject of this
ie
when we are
confronted with Gowerâs use of it in English.

ii. French
ai
in tonic syllables.

(
a
)
ai
before a nasal was in Anglo-Norman writing
very commonly represented by
ei
. This is merely a question
of spelling apparently, the sound designated being the same in
either case. Our author (or his scribe) had a certain preference for
uniformity of appearance in each set of rhymes. Thus he gives us
first
solein
,
plein
,
soverein
,
certein
,

mein
,
Evein
, in
Mir.
73 ff., then
vain
,

grain
,
main
,
gain
,
pain
,
vilain
,
2199 ff.; or again
haltaines
,
paines
,
acompaines
,

compaines
,
restraines
,
certaines
, 603 ff., but

peine
,
constreine
,
vileine
,
peine
(verb),

aleine
,
procheine
, 2029 ff. Sometimes however the
two forms of spelling are intermixed, as
vein
,
pain
,

main
, &c., 16467 ff., or
meine
,
humeine
,

capitaine
, 759 ff. Some of the words in the
ai
series,
as
pain
,
gain
,
compaine
, are spelt with
ai

only, but there are rhyme-sequences in
-ain
without any of
these words included, as 6591 ff.,
main
,
prochain
,

vilain
,
certain
,
vain
,
sain
; also
words with original French
ei
, such as
peine
,

constreine
,
restreines
,
enseigne
,
plein

(plenus),
veine
[Pg xxiii]
(vena),
meinz
(minus),
atteins
,

feinte
,
exteinte
, enter into the same class. Thus we
must conclude that before a nasal these two diphthongs were completely
confused. It must be noted that the liquid sound of the nasal in such
words as
enseigne
,
plaigne
, had been completely lost, but
the letter
g
with which it was associated in French continued
to be very generally written, and by the influence of these words

g
was often introduced without justification into others. Thus
we have the rhymes
ordeigne
,
meine
,
semeigne

(=
semaine
),
desdeigne
,
peine
, 2318 ff.;

peigne
(=
peine
),
compleigne
,
pleine
,

meine
,
halteigne
,
atteigne
, in
Bal.
iii;
while in
gaign
,
bargaign
, rhyming with
grain
,

prochain
, &c.,
g
is omitted at pleasure. Evidently in the
Anglo-Norman of this period it had no phonetic value.

(
b
) When not before a nasal,
ai
and
ei
do not
interchange freely in this manner. Before
l
,
ll
, it is
true,
ei
has a tendency to become
ai
, as in
conseil
consail
(also
consal
),
consei(l)ler consail(l)er
,

merveille mervaille
; also we have
contrefeite
,

souffreite
, 6305 ff.,
eie
for
aie
(
avoir
),

eir
for
air
13867,
gleyve
14072,
meistre

24714,
eide
(
eyde
) for
aide
in the rubric
headings,
paleis
(
palois
) for
palais
, and

vois
(representing
veis
) sometimes for
vais

(vado); also in ante-tonic syllables,
cheitif
,
eiant
,

eysil
,
leiter
,
meisoun
,
meistrie
,

oreisoun
,
peisible
,
pleisir
,
seisine
,

veneisoun
, beside
chaitif
,
allaiter
,

maisoun
,
maistrie
,
paisible
,
plaisir
,

saisine
. This change is much less frequent, especially in
tonic syllables, than in some earlier texts, e.g. the
Vie de S.
GrÃ©goire
.

The Anglo-Norman reduction of the diphthong
ai
and sometimes

ei
to
e
, especially before
r
and
s
, still
subsists in certain words, though the Continental French spelling
is found by its side. Thus we have
fere
,
affere
,

forsfere
,
mesfere
,
plere
,
trere
,

attrere
,
retrere
,
tere
,
debonere
,

contrere
, rhyming with
terre
,
guerre
,

quer(r)e
, &c.; also
mestre
,
nestre
,
pestre
,
rhyming with
estre
,
prestre
; and
pes
,
fes

(fascem),
fetz
,
mes
,
jammes
,
reles(s)
, in
rhyme with
ades
,
pres
,
apres
,
deces(s)
,

MoÃ¿ses
,
dess
,
mess
,
confess
. (This
series of rhymes, which has
Ä
, is of course kept distinct
from that which includes the terminations
-Ã©s
(
-ez
)
in participles, &c., and such words as
Ã©es
,
dÃ©es
,

lÃ©es
,
prÃ©es
,
asses
,
malfÃ©s
, &c.,
which all have
áº¹
.) We find also
ese
(with the
alternative forms
aese
,
ease
, as well as
aise
),

frel
,
ele
,
megre
,
plee
(
plai
,

plait
),
trete
,
vinegre
, and in ante-tonic
syllables
appeser
,
enchesoun
,
[Pg xxiv]

esance
,
feture
,

lesser
,
mesoun
,
mestrie
,
phesant
,

pleder
,
plesance
,
plesir
,
sesoun
,

tresoun
,
treter
. In the case of many of these words the
form with
ai
is also used by our author, but the two modes
of spelling are kept apart in rhymes (except l. 18349 ff., where
we have
tere
,
terre
,
aquerre
,
faire
,

mesfaire
), so that
affere
,
attrere
, rhyme with

terre
, but
affaire
,
attraire
, with
haire
,

esclaire
,
adversaire
, and, while
jammes
is linked
with
apres
,
ades
,
pes
, we find
jammais

written when the rhyme is with
essais
,
lais
,
paix
.
This may be only due to the desire for uniformity in spelling, but
there is some reason to think that it indicates in these words an
alternative pronunciation.

It is to be observed that on the neutral ground of
e
some words
with original
ei
meet those of which we have been speaking, in
which
ai
was reduced to
e
in rather early Anglo-Norman
times. Thus we have
crere
rhyming with
terre
,

affere
, &c.;
crestre
,
acrestre
,
descrestre
,
with
estre
,
nestre
; and
encres
,
descres
,

malves
, with
apres
,
pes
. These forms, which have
descended to our author from his predecessors, are used by him side
by side with the (later) French forms
croire
,
croistre
,

acroistre
,
descroistre
,
encrois
,
descrois
,
and these alternative forms must undoubtedly be separated from the
others in sound as well as in spelling. This being so, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that the case was the same with the
ai

words, and that in adopting the Continental French forms side by side
with the others the writer was bringing in also the French diphthong
sound, retaining however the traditional Anglo-Norman pronunciation in
both these classes of words where it happened to be more convenient or
to suit his taste better.

(
c
) The French terminations
-aire
and
-oire
,
from Lat.
-arius
,
-oria
,
-orius
, are employed by
Gower both in his French and English works in their Continental forms,
the older Anglo-Norman
-arie
,
-orie
, which passed into
English, being hardly found in his writings. The following are some
of the words in question, most of which occur in the
Confessio
Amantis
in the same form:
adversaire
,
contraire

(
contrere
),
doaire
,
essamplaire
,
lettuaire
,

necessaire
,
saintuaire
;
consistoire
,

Gregoire
,
histoire
,
memoire
,
purgatoire
,

victoire
. We have however exceptionally
rectorie

16136, accented to rhyme with
simonye
, and also (from Lat.

-erium
)
misterie
(by the side of
misteire
)
accented on the ante-penultimate.

[Pg xxv]

iii. French
ei
not before a nasal.

This diphthong, which appears usually as
ei
in the Anglo-Norman
texts of the thirteenth century, is here regularly represented by

oi
and levelled, as in the French of the Continent, with
original French
oi
. In its relations to
e
and
ai

it has already been spoken of; at present we merely note that the
later French form is adopted by our author with some few exceptions
both in stems and flexion. Isolated exceptions are
deis

(debes) for
dois
,
heir
by the side of
hoir
,

lampreie
,
malveis
(also
malvois
,
malves
),

teille
, and
vei
(vide) from
veoir
; also in verbs
of the
-ceivre
class and in derivatives from them it is often
retained, as
resceivre
(but
reÃ§oit
,
resÃ§oivre
),

receipte
,
conceipt
(also
conÃ§oit
),

conceive
,
deceite
, &c. Under the influence of rhyme we
have in 6301 ff.
espleite
,
estreite
,
coveite
,
rhyming with
deceite
,
contrefeite
,
souffreite
,
and 10117 ff.
pareies
(parietes),
veies
,
preies
,

moneies
rhyming with
pareies
and
journeies

(for
parÃ©es
,
journÃ©es
); but elsewhere the forms are

exploite
,
estroite
,
covoite
,
voie
,

proie
,
monoie
, and, in general, Anglo-Norman forms such
as
mei
,
rei
,
fei
,
treis
,
Engleis
,
have disappeared before the French
moi
,
roi
,
foy
,

trois
, &c.

The terminations of infinitives in
-eir
have become
-oir
,
except where the form has been reduced to that of the first
conjugation; and those of imperfects and conditionals (imperfects
reduced all to one form) have regularly
oi
instead of
ei
.
There is no intermixture of
ei
and
oi
inflexions, such
as we find in Angier, in the
Vie de S. Auban
, and in Bozon.
In a few isolated instances we have
ai
for this
oi
of
inflexion, as
poait
in
Mir.
795,
solait
10605
&c. (which last seems to be sometimes present rather than imperf.),
and
volait
13763. Also occasionally in other cases, as

curtais
, 5568, in rhyme with
mais
,
mesfais
, &c.,
elsewhere
curtois
,
array
, 18964, rhyming with
nay
,

essay
, usually
arroy
, and
desplaie
,
manaie
,

Bal.
xxvii. 2, elsewhere
desploie
,
manoie
. There
is however nothing like that wholesale use of
ai
for
ei

(
oi
) which is especially characteristic of Langtoft, who besides
the inflexion in
-ait
has (for example)
may
,
cray
,

ray
, for
moi
,
croy
,
roi
.

In ante-tonic syllables we may note the
ei
of
beneiÃ§oun
,

freidure
,
leisir
(usually
loisir
),

Malveisie
,
peitrine
(also
poitrine
),
veisin

(beside
voisin
),
veisdye
, &c., and
ai
in

arraier
,
braier
.

iv. The diphthong
oe
(
ue
) is written in a good many
words,
[Pg xxvi]
but it may be doubted whether it had really the pronunciation
of a diphthong. The following list contains most of the words in
which it is found in the tonic syllable:
avoec
,
boef
,

coecs
(coquus),
coer
,
controeve
,
demoert
,

doel
,
joefne
,
moeble
,
moel
,
moet
moeve
(from
movoir
),
moers moert moerge
(from

morir
),
noeces
,
noef
,
noet
,
oef
,

oel
,
oeps
,
oevre
,
poeple
,
poes
poet
,
proesme
,
soe
,
soeffre
,
soen
,

troeffe
,
troeve
,
voegle
,
voes
(also

voels
),
voet
(also
voelt
). In the case of
many of these there are variations of form to
o
,
u
,

ue
, or
ui
; thus we have
cuer
(the usual
form in the
Mirour
),
controve
,
jofne
,

noces
,
owes
(dissyll. as plur. of
oef
, also

oefs
,
oes
),
ovre
,
pueple
,
pus

(also
puiss
),
puet
(also
poot
),
prosme
,

sue
,
truffe
,
trove
,
volt
, and (before an
original guttural)
nuit
,
oill
(oculum). Two of these
words,
cuer
and
oel
, occur in rhyme, and they both
rhyme with
áº¹
:
mortiel
,
oel
,
fraternel
,

viel
, 3733 ff., and
cuer
,
curer
,
primer
,
13129 ff., by which it would appear that in them at least the diphthong
sound had been lost: cp.
suef
in rhyme with
chief
,

relief
,
Bal.

L.
2. The same rhyming of
cuer

(
quer
) occurs in the
Vie de S. Auban
, in Langtoft and in
Bozon (see M. Meyerâs introduction to Bozonâs
Contes MoralizÃ©s
).
With
avoec
we also find
aveoc
and
avec
,

veot
occurs once for
voet
, and
illeoc
,

illeoque(s)
, are the forms used from Lat.
illuc
.

v. French
á»
(
eu
,
ou
) from Latin
Å
(not
before nasal).

The only cases that I propose to speak of here are the terminations of
substantives and adjectives corresponding to the Latin
-orem
,

-osus
, or in imitation of these forms. Our author has here
regularly
ou
; there is hardly a trace of the older forms in

-or
,
-ur
, and
-os
,
-us
, and surprisingly
few accommodated to the Continental
-eur
and
-eus
. The
following are most of the words of this class which occur with the

-eur
,
-eus
, endings:
pescheur
(piscatorem),

fleur
,
greigneur
,
honeur
,
meilleur
,

seigneur
(usually
flour
,
greignour
,
honour
,

meillour
,
seignour
);
boscheus
,
honteus

(usually
hontous
),
joyeuse
(fem.) but
joyous

(masc.),
oiceus
(
oiseus
),
perceus
,
piteus

(more often
pitous
). We have also
blasphemus
, 2450,
which may be meant for
blasphemous
, and
prodegus
, 8425
ff., which is perhaps merely the Latin word âprodigus.â Otherwise the
terminations are regularly
-our
,
-ous
, except where words
in
-our
vary to
-ure
, as
chalure
, for the sake of
rhyme. The following are some of them, and it will be seen that those
which passed into
[Pg xxvii]
the literary English of the fourteenth century for
the most part appeared there with the same forms of spelling as they
have here. Indeed not a few, especially of the
-ous
class, have
continued unchanged down to the present day.

In

:

vi. French
á»
before nasal, Latin
Å
,
Å
,
u
.

(
a
) Except where it is final,
on
usually remains,
whether followed by a dental or not. The tendency towards
ou
,
which produced the modern English
amount
,
account
,

abound
,
profound
,
announce
, &c., is here
very slightly visible. Once
blounde
occurs, in rhyme with

monde
,
confonde
, &c., and we have also
rounge

2886 (
runge
3450) and
sounge
5604 (also
ronge
,

songe
), and in ante-tonic syllables
bountÃ©
,

bountevous
,
nouncier
(also
noncier
),

plunger
(also
plonger
),
sounger
, and words
compounded with
noun
, as
nounsage
,
nouncertein
,
&c. On the other hand
seconde
,
faconde
,
monde
,

abonde
,
rebonde
,
responde
, 1201 ff.,
monde

(adj.),
bonde
,
redonde
, 4048 ff.,
suronde
,

confonde
, 8199 ff.,
monde
,
onde
,
confonde
,
10838 ff.,
amonte
,
honte
,
accompte
,
conte
,

surmonte
,
demonte
, 1501 ff. The
-ount
termination
in verbal inflexion, which is common in Bozon,
ount
,

sount
,
fount
,
dirrount
, &c., is not found here
except in the Table of Contents.

(
b
) When a word ends with the nasal,
-on
is usually
developed into
-oun
. In Gowerâs French a large proportion of
the words with this ending have both forms (assuming always that the
abbreviation
[Pg xxviii]

-oÌ
nÌ

is to be read
-oun
, a point which
will be discussed hereafter), but
-oun
is the more usual,
especially perhaps in rhyme. The older Anglo-Norman
-un
has
completely disappeared. Words in
-oun
and
-on
rhyme
freely with one another, but the tendency is towards uniformity, and
at the same time there is apparently no rhyme sequence on the ending

-on
alone. The words with which we have to deal are, first,
that large class of common substantives with terminations from Lat.

-onem
; secondly, a few outlandish proper names,
e.g.

Salomon
,
Simon
,
Pharaon
,
Pigmalion
, with
which we may class occasional verbal inflexions as
lison
,

soion
; and, thirdly, a certain number of other words, chiefly
monosyllables, as
bo(u)n
,
doun
,
mo(u)n
,

no(u)n
(=
non
),
noun
(=
nom
),

reboun
,
renoun
,
so(u)n
(pron.),
soun

(subst.),
to(u)n
, also
respoun
(imperative). In the
first and third class
-oun
is decidedly preferred, but in the
second we regularly find
-on
, and it is chiefly when words of
this class occur in the rhyme that variations in the others are found
in this position. Thus l. 409 ff. we have the rhymes
noun
,

temptacioun
,
soun
,
resoun
,
baroun
,

garisoun
; 689 ff.
contemplacioun
,
tribulacioun
,

temptacioun
,
collacioun
,
delectacioun
,

elacioun
; so also in 1525 ff., and even when
Salomon

comes in at ll. 1597 and 1669, all the other rhymes of these
stanzas are
-oun
:
presumpcioun
,
respoun
,

resoun
,
noun
,
doun
, &c. At 2401 however we have

maison
,
noun
,
contradiccioun
,
lison
;
2787
Salomon
,
leÃ§on
,
enchesoun
,
resoun
;
4069
noun
,
tenÃ§on
,
compaignoun
,
feloun
,

Catoun
,
confessioun
; and similarly
faÃ§on
6108,

religion
(with
lison
) 7922,
lison
,
lion
,

giroun
,
enviroun
,
leÃ§on
,
noun
, 16801 ff.
(yet
lisoun
is also found, 24526). On the whole, so far as
the rhymes of the
Mirour
are concerned, the conclusion must
be that the uniformity is broken chiefly by the influence of those
words which have been noted as written always, or almost always, with

-on
. In the
Balades
and
TraitiÃ©
, however, the two
terminations are more equally balanced; for example in
Bal.

xxxv we find
convocacion
,
compaignon
,
comparison
,

regioun
,
noun
,
supplicacion
,
eleccion
,

condicioun
, &c., without any word of the class referred to,
and
TraitiÃ©
xii has four rhymes in
-on
against two in

-oun
. On the whole I am disposed to think that it is merely
a question of spelling, and it must be remembered that in the MSS.

-oun
is very rarely written out in full, so that the difference
between the two forms is very slight even in appearance.

vii. The Central-French
u
was apparently identified in sound
[Pg xxix]

with
eu
, and in some cases not distinguished from
ui
.
The evidence of rhymes seems quite clear and consistent on this point.
Such sequences as the following occur repeatedly:
abatu
,

pourveu
,
deÃ§u
,
lieu
,
perdu
,
salu
,
315 ff.;
truis
,
perduz
,
Hebrus
,
us
,

jus
,
conclus
, 1657 ff.;
hebreu
,
feru
,

eeu
,
tenu
,
neveu
,
rendu
, 4933 ff.;

plus
,
lieus
,
perdus
,
conÃ§uz
,
huiss
,

truis
, 6723 ff.;
fu
,
lu
(for
lieu
),

offendu
,
dieu
, in
Bal.
xviii; and with the
ending
-ure
,
-eure
:
demeure
,
lâeure
,

nature
,
verdure
,
desseure
,
mesure
, 937
ff.;
painture
,
demesure
,
aventure
,
jure
,

hure
,
controveure
, 1947 ff., &c. This being so, we cannot
be surprised at such forms as
hebru
for
hebreu
,
lu

for
lieu
,
fu
for
feu
,
hure
,
demure
,

plure
, for the Continental French
heure
,
demeure
,

pleure
, or at the substitutions of
u
for
ui
,
or
ui
for
u
(
eu
), in
aparÃ§ut aparÃ§uit
,

huiss huss
,
plus pluis
,
pertuis pertus
,
puiss
pus
,
construire construre
,
destruire destrure
,

estruis estrus
,
truis trieus
. As regards the latter
changes we may compare the various spellings of
fruit
,

bruit
,
suit
,
eschuie
,
suie
[G]
, in Middle
English. It should be mentioned however that
luy
rhymes
regularly with
-i
(
-y
), as
chery
,
servi
,

dy
. In some cases also
ui
interchanges with
oi
,
as in
buiste
beside
boiste
,
enpuisonner
beside

poisoun
. This is often found in early Anglo-Norman and is
exemplified in M.E.
buyle boyle
,
fuysoun foysoun
,

destroye destruien
. On this change and on that between
ui

and
u
in Anglo-Norman see Koschwitz on the
Voyage de
Charlemagne
, pp. 39, 40.

viii.
aun
occurs occasionally for
an
final or
before a consonant e.g. in
aun
(annum)
Mir.
6621,

Bal.
xxiii. 2,
sauntÃ©(e)

Mir.
2522,
Ded.
ii.
5, &c.,
dauncer
17610,
paunce
8542,
fiaunce
,

sufficaunce
,
Bal.
iv,
governaunce
,

fraunchise
,
fraunchement
, in the Table of Contents;
but much more usually not, as
Alisandre
,
an
(1932),

avant
,
dance
(1697),
danger
,
danter
,

France
,
change
,
fiance
(
Bal.
xiii. &c.),

lance
,
lande
,
pance
(5522 &c.),
sergant
,

sufficance
(1738 &c.),
vante
, and in general the words in

-ance
.

ix. Contraction or suppression of atonic vowels takes place in certain
cases besides that of the termination
-Ã©e
, which has already
been discussed.

(
a
) When atonic
e
and another vowel or diphthong come
together in a word they are usually contracted, as in
asseurer
,

commeu
,
eust
,
receu
,
veu
(2387),

vir
(for
veÃ¯r
),
Beemoth
,
beneurÃ©
,
[Pg xxx]

benoit
,

deesce
,
emperour
,
mirour
,
obeissance
,

ranÃ§on
,
seur
, &c., but in many instances contraction does
not take place, as
cheeu
,
eeu
,
veeu
,
veÃ¯r
,

veoir
,
empereour
(23624),
leÃ«sce
,
mireour

(23551),
tricheour
,
venqueour
,
meÃ«ment
, &c.

(
b
) In some words with
-ie
termination the accent falls
on the antepenultimate, and the
i
which follows the tonic
syllable is regularly slurred in the metre and sometimes not written.
Such words are
accidie
,
contumelie
,
familie
,

misterie
,
perjurie
,
pluvie
,
remedie
,

vituperie
, and occasionally a verb, as
encordie
.

The following are examples of their metrical treatment:â

âDes queux lâun Vituperie ad noun,â 2967;

âEt sa familie et sa maisoun,â 3916;

âCar pluvie doit le vent suÃ¯r,â 4182;

âMaint contumelie irrous atteint,â 4312;

âPerjurie, qâad sa foy perdu,â 6409;

âQui pour mes biens mâencordie et lie,â 6958, &c.

Several of these words are also written with the ending
-e
for

-ie
, as
accide
,
famile
,
encorde
.

Such words are similarly treated in Gowerâs English lines, e.g.

âAnd ek the god Mercurie alsoâ (
Conf. Am.
i. 422);

cp. Chaucerâs usual treatment of words like
victorie
,

glorie
, which are not used in that form by Gower.

(
c
) In
come
(
comme
),
sicome
, and
ove

the final
e
never counts as a syllable in the metre. They
are sometimes written
com
and
ou
. In another word,

ore
, the syllable is often slurred, as in
Mir.
37, 1775,
3897, &c., but sometimes sounded, as 4737, 11377,
Bal.
xxviii.
1. So perhaps also
dame
in
Mir.
6733, 13514, 16579, and

Bal.
ii. 3, xix. 3, xx. 2, &c.

x. The insertion of a parasitic
e
in connexion with
r
,
and especially between
v
and
r
, is a recognized
feature of the Anglo-Norman dialect. Examples of this in our texts
are
avera
,
devera
,
saveroit
,
coverir
,

deliverer
,
overir
,
vivere
,
livere
,

oevere
,
overage
,
povere
,
yvere
, &c. As a
rule this
e
is not sounded as a syllable in the metre, and in
most of these words there is an alternative spelling, e.g.
avra
,

savra
,
covrir
,
delivrer
,
ovrir
,

vivre
,
oevre
, &c., but it is not necessary to reduce them
to this wherever the
e
is mute. Less usually the syllable counts
in the verse, e.g.
overaigne
in
Mir.
3371,
overage

8914,
enyverer
16448,
avera
18532,
deveroit
,

beveroit
in 20702 ff.
viverai
,
vivera
in

Bal.
iv.* 1,
Mir.
3879,
descoverir
in
Bal.

ix. 1.

[Pg xxxi]

xi. About the consonants not much need be said.

(
a
) Initial
c
before
a
varies in some words
with
ch
, as
caccher
,
caitif
,
camele
,

camp
,
carboun
,
castell
,
catell
, by the
side of
chacer
,
chaitif
,
chameal
,
champ
,

charboun
,
chastel
,
chateaux
; cp.
acater
,

achater
. Before
e
,
i
, we find sometimes an
interchange of
c
and
s
, as in
ce
for
se
in

Mir.
1147,
Bal.
xviii. 3;
câil
for
sâil

in
Mir.
799 &c.; and, on the other hand,
sent
for

cent
in
Bal.
xli. 2,
si
for
ci
in the
title of the
Cinkante Balades
,
sil
for
cil
in

Bal.
xlii. 3,
sercher
for
cercher
in
Mir.

712 &c., also
s
for
sc
in
septre
,
sintille
,
and
sc
for
s
in
scilence
.

(
b
) We find often
qant
,
qe
,
qelle
,

qanqe
, &c., for
quant
,
que
, &c., and, on the other
hand, the spelling
quar
for the more usual
car
. In words
like
guaign
,
guaire
,
guaite
,
guarant
,

guarde
,
guarir
,
guaster
,
u
is very
frequently omitted before
a
, also occasionally before other
vowels, as
gile
, 21394, for
guile
:
w
is used in

warder
,
rewarder
,
way
.

(
c
) The doubling of single consonants, especially
l
,

m
,
n
,
p
,
s
, is frequent and seems to
have no phonetic significance. Especially it is to be observed that

ss
for
s
at the end of a word makes no difference to
the quantity or quality of the syllable, thus, whether the word
be
deces
or
decess
,
reles
or
reless
,

engres
or
engress
,
bas
or
bass
,
las

or
lass
,
huiss
or
huis
, the pronunciation and the
rhyme are the same. The final
s
was sounded in both cases, and
not more when double than when single. The doubling of
r
in
futures and conditionals, as
serray
,
dirray
, &c., belongs
to the Norman dialect.

(
d
) The final
s
of inflexion is regularly replaced
by
z
after a dental, as
courtz
,
desfaitz
,

ditz
,
excellentz
,
fitz
,
fortz
,

regentz
,
seintz
, and frequently in past participles
of verbs (where there is an original dental), as
perturbez
,

enfanteez
,
rejoÃ¯z
,
perduz
; but also elsewhere,
especially with the termination
-able
, as
refusablez
,

delitablez
, in rhyme with
acceptables
. Sometimes however
a dental drops out before
s
, as in
apers
,
desfais
,

dis
,
dolens
,
presens
. In all these cases however
the difference is one of spelling only.

(
e
) Lastly, notice may be directed to the mute consonants
either surviving in phonetic change or introduced into the spelling
in imitation of the Latin form. The fourteenth century was a time
when French writers and copyists were especially prone to the vice of
etymological spelling, and many forms both in French and English which
have been supposed to be of later date may be traced to this period. I
shall point out some instances, etymological and other, most of which
occur in rhyme.

[Pg xxxii]

Thus
b
is mute in
doubte
(also
doute
) rhyming
with
boute
, and also in
debte
beside
dette
,

soubdeinement
beside
soudeinement
, &c.:

p
in
temps
,
accompte
,
corps
,
hanaps
,

descript
, rhyming with
sens
,
honte
,
tors
,

pas
,
dit
, and in
deceipte
beside
deceite
;

d
before
s
in
ribalds
rhyming with
vassals
;

t
before
z
in such words as
fortz
,
courtz
,

certz
,
overtz
,
fitz
,
ditz
,
aletz
,

decretz
, rhyming with
tors
,
destours
,
vers
,

envers
,
sis
,
dignitÃ©s
,
Ã©es
;

s
in such forms as
dist
,
promist
,

quidasmes
, &c., in rhyme with
esjoÃ¯t
,
espirit
,

dames
; possibly however the 3 pers. sing. pret. of these verbs
had an alternative pronunciation in which
s
was sounded, for
they several times occur in rhyme with
Crist
, and then are
always written
-ist
, whereas at other times they vary this
freely with
-it
.

g
in words like
baraign
,
pleigne
,

soveraigne
, rhyming with
gain
,
peine
;

c
before
s
in
clercs
(also
clers
) rhyming
with
vers
;

l
in
almes
,
ascoulte
,
moult
, which
rhyme with
fames
,
route
,
trestout
and
in
oultrage
,
estoultie
, beside
outrage
,

estoutie
.

On the other hand
v
is sounded in the occasional form

escrivre
, the word being rhymed with
vivre
, in

Mir.
6480.

As regards the Vocabulary, I propose to note a few points which are of
interest with reference chiefly to English Etymology, and for the rest
the reader is referred to the Glossary.

A certain number of words will be found, in addition to those already
cited in the remarks on Phonology, Â§ v, which appear in the French of
our texts precisely as they stand in modern English, e.g.
able
,

annoy
,
archer
,
carpenter
,
claret
,

courser
,
dean
,
draper
,
ease
,
fee
,

haste
,
host
,
mace
,
mess
,
noise
,

soldier
,
suet
,
treacle
,
truant
, &c.,
not to mention âmots savantsâ such as
abject
,
absent
,

official
,
parable
, and so on.

The doubling of consonants in accordance with Latin spelling in

accepter
,
accord
,
accuser
,
commander
,

commun
, &c., is already common in these texts and belongs to an
earlier stage of Middle English than is usually supposed.

ambicioun
: note the etymological meaning of this word in the

Mirour
.

appetiter
: Chaucerâs verb should be referred directly to this
French verb, and not to the English subst.
appetit
.

[Pg xxxiii]

assalt
: usually
assaut
in 14th cent. French and English.

audit
: the English word is probably from this French form,
and not directly from Latin: the same remark applies to several
other words, as
complet
,
concluder
,
curet
,

destitut
,
elat
, &c.

avouer
: in the sense of âpromise.â

begant
,
beggerie
,
beguyner
,
beguinage
: see

New Eng. Dict.
under âbeg.â The use of
beguinage
here as
equivalent to
beggerie
is confirmatory of the Romance etymology
suggested for the word:
begant
seems to presuppose a verb

beg(u)er
, a shorter form of
beguiner
; cp.
beguard
.

braier
, M.E.
brayen
, âto bray in a mortar.â The
continental form was
breier

brusch
: the occurrence of this word in a sense which seems
to identify it with
brusque
should be noted. The modern

brusque
is commonly said to have been introduced into
French from Italy in the 16th century. Caxton however in 1481 has

brussly
, apparently equivalent to âbrusquelyâ; see
New Eng.
Dict.

buillon
, in the sense of âmint,â or âmelting-house,â is
evidently the same as âbullionâ in the Anglo-Norman statutes of Edward
III (see
New Eng. Dict.
). The form which we have here points
very clearly to its derivation from the verb
builer
, âboil,â as
against the supposed connexion with âbulla.â

chitoun
, âkitten.â This is used also in Bozonâs
Contes
MoralizÃ©s
. It seems more likely that the M.E.
kitoun
comes
from this form of
chatton
with hardening of
ch
to

k
by the influence of
cat
, than that it is an English
âkitâ with a French suffix.

Civile
, i.e. âcivil lawâ: cp. the use of the word as a name in

Piers Plowman
.

eneauer
, âto wet,â supplies perhaps an etymology for the
word
enewing
or
ennuyng
used by Lydgate and others
as a term of painting, to indicate the laying on or gradation of
tints in water-colour, and illustrates the later Anglo-French words

enewer
,
enewage
, used apparently of shrinking cloth by
wetting; see Godefroy (who however leaves them unexplained).

flaket
, the same as the M.E.
flakett
,
flacket

(French
flaschet
). The form
flaquet
is assumed as a
Northern French word by the
New Eng. Dict.
, but not cited as
occurring.

Authorship.
âThe evidence of authorship rests on two distinct
grounds: first, its correspondence in title and contents with the
description given by Gower of his principal French work; and secondly,
its remarkable resemblance in style and substance to the poetâs
acknowledged works.

We return therefore to the statement before referred to about the
three principal books claimed by our author: and first an explanation
should be made on the subject of the title. The
[Pg xxxv]
statement in question
underwent progressive revision at the hands of the author and appears
in three forms, the succession of which is marked by the fact that
they are connected with three successive editions of the
Confessio
Amantis
. In the two first of these three forms the title of the
French work is
Speculum Hominis
, in the third it is
Speculum
Meditantis
, the alteration having been made apparently in order
to produce similarity of termination with the titles of the two other
books
[H]
. We are justified therefore in assuming that the original
title was
Speculum Hominis
, or its French equivalent,
Mirour
de lâomme
. The authorâs account, then, of his French work is as
follows:

âPrimus liber Gallico sermone editus in decem diuiditur partes, et
tractans de viciis et virtutibus, necnon et de variis huius seculi
gradibus, viam qua peccator transgressus ad sui creatoris agnicionem
redire debet recto tramite docere conatur. Titulus (que) libelli istius
Speculum hominis (
al.
meditantis) nuncupatus est.â

We are here told that the book is in French, that it is divided into
ten parts, that it treats of vices and virtues, and also of the various
degrees or classes of people in this world, and finally that it shows
how the sinner may return to the knowledge of his Creator.

The division of our
Mirour
into ten parts might have been a
little difficult to make out from the work itself, but it is expressly
indicated in the Table of Contents prefixed:

âCy apres comence le livre FranÃ§ois qâest apellÃ© Mirour de lâomme, le
quel se divide en x parties, câest assavoirâ &c.

The ten parts are then enumerated, six of them being made out of the
classification of the different orders of society.

The contents of the
Mirour
also agree with the authorâs
description of his
Speculum Hominis
. After some prefatory matter
it treats of vices in ll. 841-9720 of the present text; of virtues ll.
10033-18372; of the various orders of society ll. 18421-26604; of how
manâs sin is the cause of the corruption of the world ll. 26605-27360;
and finally how the sinner may return to God, or, as the Table of
Contents has it, âcoment lâomme peccheour lessant ses mals se doit
reformer a dieu et avoir pardoun par lâeyde de nostre seigneur Jhesu
Crist et de sa
[Pg xxxvi]
doulce Miere la Vierge gloriouse,â l. 27361 to the end.
This latter part includes a Life of the Virgin, through whom the sinner
is to obtain the grace of God.

The strong presumption (to say no more) which is raised by the
agreement of all these circumstances is converted into a certainty
when we come to examine the book more closely and to compare it with
the other works of Gower. Naturally we are disposed to turn first to
his acknowledged French writings, the
Cinkante Balades
and the

TraitiÃ©
, and to institute a comparison in regard to the language
and the forms of words. The agreement here is practically complete,
and the Glossary of this edition is arranged especially with a view to
exhibit this agreement in the clearest manner. There are differences,
no doubt, such as there will always be between different MSS., however
correct, but they are very few. Moreover, in the structure of sentences
and in many particular phrases there are close correspondences, some
of which are pointed out in the Notes. But, while the language test
gives quite satisfactory results, so far as it goes, we cannot expect
to find a close resemblance in other respects between two literary
works so different in form and in motive as the
Mirour
and the

Balades
. It is only when we institute a comparison between the

Mirour
and the two other principal works, in Latin and English
respectively, which our author used as vehicles for his serious
thoughts, that we realize how impossible it is that the three should
not all belong to one author. Gower, in fact, was a man of stereotyped
convictions, whose thoughts on human society and on the divine
government of the world tended constantly to repeat themselves in but
slightly varying forms. What he had said in one language he was apt to
repeat in another, as may be seen, even if we leave the
Mirour

out of sight, by comparison of the
Confessio Amantis
with the

Vox Clamantis
. The
Mirour
runs parallel with the English
work in its description of vices, and with the Latin in its treatment
of the various orders of society, and apart from the many resemblances
in detail, it is worth while here to call attention to the manner in
which the general arrangement of the French work corresponds with that
which we find in the other two books.

In that part of the
Mirour
which treats of vices, each deadly
sin is dealt with regularly under five principal heads, or, as the
author expresses it, has five daughters. Now this fivefold
[Pg xxxvii]
division
is not, so far as I can discover, borrowed from any former writer. It
is of course quite usual in moral treatises to deal with the deadly
sins by way of subdivision, but usually the number of subdivisions
is irregular, and I have not found any authority for the systematic
division of each into five. The only work, so far as I know, which
shares this characteristic with the
Mirour
is the
Confessio
Amantis
. It is true that in this the rule is not fully carried out;
the nature of the work did not lend itself so easily to a quite regular
treatment, and considerable variations occur: but the principle which
stands as the basis of the arrangement is clearly visible, and it is
the same which we find in our
Mirour
.

This is a point which it is worth while to exhibit a little more at
large, and here the divisions of the first three deadly sins are set
forth in parallel columns:

Mirour de lâomme.

Confessio Amantis.

i. Orguil, with five daughters, viz.

i. Pride, with five ministers, viz.

Ipocresie

iii. Ire

In the latter part of the
Confessio Amantis
the fivefold
division is not strictly observed, and in some books the author does
not profess to deal with all the branches; but in what is given
above there is quite enough to show that this method of division was
recognized and that the main headings are the same in the two works.

Next we may compare the classes of society given in the
Mirour

with those that we find in the
Vox Clamantis
. It is not
necessary to exhibit these in a tabular form; it is enough to say
[Pg xxxviii]

that with some trifling differences of arrangement the enumeration
is the same. In the
Vox Clamantis
the estate of kings stands
last, because the author wished to conclude with a lecture addressed
personally to Richard II; and the merchants, artificers and labourers
come before the judges, lawyers, sheriffs, &c., because it is intended
to bring these last into connexion with the king; but otherwise there
is little or no difference even in the smallest details. The contents
of the âthird partâ of the
Mirour
, dealing with prelates and
dignitaries of the Church and with the parish clergy, correspond
to those of the third book of the
Vox Clamantis
; the fourth
part, which treats of those under religious rule, Possessioners and
Mendicants, is parallel to the fourth book of the Latin work. In the

Mirour
as in the
Vox Clamantis
we have the division of
the city population into Merchants, Artificers and Victuallers, and of
the ministers of the law into Judges, Advocates, Viscounts (sheriffs),
Bailiffs, and Jurymen. Moreover what is said of the various classes
is in substance usually the same, most notably so in the case of the
parish priests and the tradesmen of the town; but parallels of this
kind will be most conveniently pointed out in the Notes.

To proceed, the
Mirour
will be found to contain a certain number
of stories, and of those that we find there by much the greater number
reappear in the
Confessio Amantis
with a similar application.
We have the story of the envious man who desired to lose one eye in
order that his comrade might be deprived of two (l. 3234), of Socrates
and his scolding wife (4168), of the robbery from the statue of Apollo
(7093), of Lazarus and Dives (7972), of Ulysses and the Sirens (10909),
of the emperor Valentinian (17089), of Sara the daughter of Raguel
(17417), of Phirinus, the young man who defaced his beauty in order
that he might not be a temptation to women (18301), of Codrus king
of Athens (19981), of Nebuchadnezzarâs pride and punishment (21979),
of the king and his chamberlains (22765). All these are found in the

Mirour
, and afterwards, more fully related as a rule, in the

Confessio Amantis
. Only one or two, the stories of St. Macaire
and the devil (12565, 20905), of the very undeserving person who was
relieved by St. Nicholas (15757), of the dishonest man who built a
church (15553), together with various Bible stories rather alluded to
than related, and the long Life of the Virgin at the end of the book,
remain the property of the
Mirour
alone.

[Pg xxxix]

If we take next the anecdotes and emblems of Natural History, we shall
find them nearly all again in either the Latin or the English work.
To illustrate the vice of Detraction we have the âescarbud,â the
âscharnebud,â of the
Confessio Amantis
, which takes no delight
in the flowery fields or in the May sunshine, but only seeks out vile
ordure and filth (2894,
Conf. Am.
ii. 413). Envy is compared to
the nettle which grows about the roses and destroys them by its burning
(3721,
Conf. Am.
ii. 401). Homicide is made more odious by the
story of the bird with a manâs features, which repents so bitterly of
slaying the creature that resembles it (5029,
Conf. Am.
iii.
2599); and we may note also that in both books this authentic anecdote
is ascribed to Solinus, who after all is not the real authority for it.
Idleness is like the cat that would eat fish without wetting her paws
(5395,
Conf. Am.
iv. 1108). The covetous man is like the pike
that swallows down the little fishes (6253,
Conf. Am.
v. 2015).
Prudence is the serpent which refuses to hear the voice of the charmer,
and while he presses one ear to the ground, stops the other with his
tail (15253,
Conf. Am.
i. 463). And so on.

Then again there are a good many quotations common to the
Mirour

and one or both of the other books, adduced in the same connexion
and sometimes grouped together in the same order. The passage from
Gregoryâs Homilies about man as a microcosm, partaking of the nature
of every creature in the universe, which we find in the Prologue of
the
Confessio
and also in the
Vox Clamantis
, appears
at l. 26869 of the
Mirour
; that about Peter presenting Judea
in the Day of Judgement, Andrew Achaia, and so on, while our bishops
come empty-handed, is also given in all three (
Mir.
20065,

Vox. Cl.
iii. 903,
Conf. Am.
v. 1900). To illustrate the
virtue of Pity the same quotations occur both in the
Mirour

and the
Confessio Amantis
, from the Epistle of St. James, from
Constantine, and from Cassiodorus (
Mir.
13929, 23055 ff.,

Conf Am.
vii. 3149*, 3161*, 3137). Three quotations referred to
âOraceâ occur in the
Mirour
, and of these three two reappear in
the
Confessio
with the same authorâs name (
Mir.
3801,
10948, 23370,
Conf. Am.
vi. 1513, vii. 3581). Now of these two,
one, as it happens, is from Ovid and the other from Juvenal; so that
not only the quotations but also the false references are repeated.
These are not by any means all the examples of common quotations, but
they will perhaps suffice.

Again, if we are not to accept the theory of common authorship,
[Pg xl]

we can hardly account for the resemblance, and something more than
resemblance, in passages such as the description of Envy (
Mir.

3805 ff.,
Conf. Am.
ii. 3095, 3122 ff.), of Ingratitude
(
Mir.
6685 ff.,
Conf. Am.
v. 4917 ff.), of the effects
of intoxication (
Mir.
8138, 8246,
Conf. Am.
vi. 19,
71), of the flock made to wander among the briars (
Mir.
20161
ff.,
Conf. Am. Prol.
407 ff.), of the vainglorious knight
(
Mir.
23893 ff.,
Conf. Am.
iv. 1627 ff.), and many
others, not to mention those lines which occur here and there in the

Confessio
exactly reproduced from the
Mirour
, such as iv.
893,

âThanne is he wys after the hond,â

compared with
Mir.
5436,

âLors est il sage apres la mein.â

Conf. Am. Prol.
213,

âOf armes and of brigantaille,â

compared with
Mir.
18675,

âOu dâarmes ou du brigantaille,â

the context in this last case being also the same.

The parallels with the
Vox Clamantis
are not less numerous and
striking, and as many of them as it seems necessary to mention are set
down in the Notes to the
Mirour
, especially in the latter part
from l. 18421 onwards.

Before dismissing the comparison with the
Confessio Amantis
, we
may call attention to two further points of likeness. First, though
the
Mirour
is written in stanzas and the
Confessio
in
couplets, yet the versification of the one distinctly suggests that of
the other. Both are in the same octosyllabic line, with the same rather
monotonous regularity of metre, and the stanza of the
Mirour
,
containing, as it does, no less than four pairs of lines which can be
read as couplets so far as the rhyme is concerned, often produces much
the same effect as the simple couplet. Secondly, in the structure of
sentences there are certain definite characteristics which produce
themselves equally in the French and the English work.

Resemblances of this latter kind will be pointed out in the Notes,
but a few may be set down here. For example, every reader of Gowerâs
English is familiar with his trick of setting the conjunctions âand,â
âbut,â &c., in the middle instead of at the beginning of the clause, as
in
Conf. Am. Prol.
155,

âWith all his herte and make hem chiere,â

[Pg xli]

and similarly in the
Balades
, e.g. xx. i,

âA mon avis mais il nâest pas ensi.â

Examples of this are common in the
Mirour
, as l. 100,

âPour noble cause et ensement

Estoiont fait,â

cp. 415, 4523, 7739, 7860, &c.

In other cases too there is a tendency to disarrangement of words or
clauses for the sake of metre or rhyme, as
Mir.
15941, 17996,
compared with
Conf. Am.
ii. 2642, iv. 3520, v. 6807, &c.

Again, the author of the
Confessio Amantis
is fond of repeating
the same form of expression in successive lines, e.g.
Prol.
96
ff.,

âTho was the lif of man in helthe,

Tho was plente, tho was richesse,

Tho was the fortune of prouesse,â &c.

Cp.
Prol.
937, v. 2469, &c.

This also is found often in the
Mirour
, e.g. 4864-9:

âCist tue viel, cist tue enfant,

Cist tue femmes enpreignant,â &c.

and 8294-8304,

âLes uns en eaue fait perir,

Les uns en flamme fait ardoir,

Les uns du contek fait morir,â &c.

The habit of breaking off the sentence and resuming it in a different
form appears markedly in both the French and the English, as

Mir.
89, 17743,
Conf. Am.
iv. 2226, 3201; and in several
passages obscure forms of expression in the
Confessio Amantis

are elucidated by parallel constructions in the
Mirour
.

Finally, the trick of filling up lines with such tags as
en son
degrÃ©
,
de sa partie
, &c. (e.g.
Mir.
373, 865),
vividly recalls the similar use of âin his degree,â âfor his partie,â
by the author of the
Confessio Amantis
(e.g.
Prol.
123,
930).

The evidence of which I have given an outline, which may be filled up
by those who care to look out the references set down above and in the
Notes, amounts, I believe, to complete demonstration that this French
book called
Mirour de lâomme
is identical with the
Speculum
Hominis
(or
Speculum Meditantis
) which has been long
supposed to be lost; and, that being so, I consider myself at liberty
to use it in every way as Gowerâs admitted work, together with the
other books of which he claims the authorship, for the illustration
both of his life and his literary characteristics.

[Pg xlii]

Date.
âThe
Speculum Hominis
stands first in order of
the three books enumerated by Gower, and was written therefore before
the
Vox Clamantis
. This last was evidently composed shortly
after the rising of the peasants in 1381, and to that event, which
evidently produced the strongest impression on the authorâs mind, there
is no reference in this book. There are indeed warnings of the danger
of popular insurrection, as 24104 ff., 26485 ff., 27229 ff., but they
are of a general character, suggested perhaps partly by the Jacquerie
in France and partly by the local disturbances caused by discontented
labourers in England, and convey the idea that the writer was uneasy
about the future, but not that a catastrophe had already come. In one
passage he utters a rather striking prophecy of the evil to be feared,
speaking of the strange lethargy in which the lords of the land are
sunk, so that they take no note of the growing madness of the commons.
On the whole we may conclude without hesitation that the book was
completed before the summer of the year 1381.

There are some other considerations which will probably lead us to
throw the date back a little further than this. In 2142 ff. it seems
to be implied that Edward III is still alive. âThey of France,â he
says, âshould know that God abhors their disobedience, in that they,
contrary to their allegiance, refuse by way of war to render homage and
obedience to him who by his birth receives the right from his mother.â
This can apply to none but Edward III, and we are led to suppose that
when these lines were written he was still alive to claim his right.
The supposition is confirmed by the manner in which the author speaks
of the reigning king in that part of his work which deals with royalty.
Nowhere does he address him as a child or youth in the manner of the

Vox Clamantis
, but he complains of the trust placed by the king
in flatterers and of the all-prevailing influence of women, calling
upon God to remedy those evils which arise from the monstrous fact
that a woman reigns in the land and the king is subject to her (22807
ff.). This is precisely the complaint which might have been expected
in the latter years of Edward III. On the other hand there is a clear
allusion in one place (18817-18840) to the schism of the Church, and
this passage therefore must have been written as late as 1378, but,
occurring as it does at the conclusion of the authorâs attack upon
the Court of Rome, it may well have been added after the rest. The
expression in l. 22191,

[Pg xliii]

âOve deux chiefs es sanz chevetein,â

refers to the Pope and the Emperor, not to the division of
the papacy. Finally, it should be observed that the introduction of the
name Innocent, l. 18783, is not to be taken to mean that Innocent VI,
who died in 1362, was the reigning pope. The name is no doubt only a
representative one.

On the whole we shall not be far wrong if we assign the composition of
the book to the years 1376-1379.

Form and Versification.
âThe poem (if it may be called so)
is written in twelve-line stanzas of the common octosyllabic verse,
rhyming
aab aab bba bba
, so that there are two sets of rhymes
only in each stanza. In its present state it has 28,603 lines, there
being lost four leaves at the beginning, which probably contained
forty-seven stanzas, that is 564 lines, seven leaves, containing in all
1342 lines, in other places throughout the volume, and an uncertain
number at the end, probably containing not more than a few hundred
lines. The whole work therefore consisted of about 31,000 lines, a
somewhat formidable total.

The twelve-line stanza employed by Gower is one which was in pretty
common use among French writers of the âmoralâ class. It is that in
which the celebrated
Vers de la Mort
were composed by HÃ©linand
de Froidmont in the twelfth century, a poem from which our author
quotes. Possibly it was the use of it by this writer that brought
it into vogue, for his poem had a great popularity, striking as
it did a note which was thoroughly congenial to the spirit of the
age
[I]
. In any case we find the stanza used also by the âReclus de
Moiliens,â by Rutebeuf in several pieces, e. g.
La Complainte de
Constantinoble
and
Les Ordres de Paris
, and often by other
poets of the moral school. Especially it seems to have been affected
in those âCongiÃ©sâ in which poets took leave of the world and of
their friends, as the
CongiÃ©s Adan dâArras
(Barb. et MÃ©on,

Fabl.
i. 106), the
CongiÃ© Jehan Bodel
(i. 135), &c. As
to the structure of the stanza, at least in the hands of our author,
there is not much to be said. The pauses in sense very generally follow
the rhyme divisions of the stanza, which has a natural tendency to
fall into two equal parts, and the last three lines, or in some cases
the last two, frequently
[Pg xliv]
contain a moral tag or a summing up of the
general drift of the stanza.

The verse is strictly syllabic. We have nothing here of that
accent-metre which the later Anglo-Norman writers sometimes adopted
after English models, constructing their octosyllable in two halves
with a distinct break between them, each half-verse having two accents
but an uncertain number of syllables. This appears to have been the
idea of the metre in the mind of such writers as Fantosme and William
of Waddington. Here however all is as regular in that respect as can
be desired. Indeed the fact that in all these thousands of lines there
are not more than about a score which even suggest the idea of metrical
incorrectness, after due allowance for the admitted licences of which
we have taken note, is a striking testimony not only of the accuracy
in this respect of the author, but also to the correctness of the copy
which we possess of his work. The following are the lines in question:

276. âDe sa part grantement sâesjoÃ¯t.â

397. âLy deable grantement sâesjoÃ¯tâ

2742. âPrestre, Clerc, Reclus, Hermite,â

2955. âSoy mesmes car delivrerâ

3116. âQâavoit leur predicacioun oÃ¯e,â

3160. âSi lâune est male, lâautre est perverse,â

4745. âMolt plussoudeinent le blesceâ

4832. âAinz est pour soy delivrer,â

6733. âDame Covoitise en sa mesonâ

(And similarly 13514 and 16579)

9617. âMais oultre trestous autrez estatzâ

9786. âMe mettroit celle alme en gage,â

10623. âLâun ad franchise, lâautre ad servage,â

10628. âLâun ad mesure, lâautre ad oultrage,â

13503. âDieus la terre en fin donna,â

14568. âEt lâautre contemplacioun enseine.â

19108. âDâavoltire et fornicaciounâ

24625. âDoun, priere, amour, doubtance,â

26830. âHomme; et puis de lâomme pristâ

27598. âQant lâangle ot ses ditz contez,â

This, it will be allowed, is a sufficiently moderate total to be placed
to the joint account of author and scribe in a matter of more than
28,000 linesâon an average one in about 1,500 lines. Of these more
than half can be corrected in very obvious ways: in 276, 397, we may
read âgrantmentâ as in 8931; in 2955, 4832, we should read âdeliverer,â
and in 9786 âmetteroit,â this
e
being
[Pg xlv]
frequently sounded in the
metre, e.g. 3371, 16448, 18532; we may correct 3160, 9617, by altering
to âmal,â âautreâ; in 4745 âplussoudeinementâ is certainly meant; 13503
is to be corrected by reading âen la fin,â as in 15299, for âen fin,â
19108 by substituting âavoltreâ for âavoltire,â and 27598 by reading
âangel,â as in 27731 and elsewhere, for âangle.â Of the irregularities
that remain, one, exemplified in 3116 and 14568, consists in the
introduction of an additional foot into the measure, and I have little
doubt that it proceeds from the scribe, who wrote âpredicaciounâ
and âcontemplaciounâ for some shorter word with the same meaning,
such as âprechementâ and âcontempler.â In the latter of these cases
I have corrected by introducing âcontemplerâ into the text; in the
former, as I cannot be so sure of the word intended, the MS. reading
is allowed to stand. There is a similar instance of a hypermetrical
line in
Bal.
xxvii. 1, and this also might easily be corrected.
The other irregularities I attribute to the author. These consist,
first, in the use of âdameâ in several lines as a monosyllable, and I
am disposed to think that this word was sometimes so pronounced, see
Phonol. Â§ ix (
c
); secondly, in the introduction of a superfluous
unaccented syllable at a pause after the second foot, which occurs
in 10623, 10628 (and perhaps 3160); thirdly, in the omission of the
unaccented syllable at the beginning of the verse, as:

âPrestre, Clerc, Reclus, Hermite,ââ2742;

âDoun, priere, amour, doubtance,ââ24625;

âHomme; et puis de lâomme pristââ26830.

Considering how often lines of this kind occur in other
Anglo-Norman verse, and how frequent the variation is generally in the
English octosyllables of the period, we may believe that even Gower,
notwithstanding his metrical strictness, occasionally introduced it
into his verse. It may be noted that the three lines just quoted
resemble one another in having each a pause after the first word.

With all this âcorrectness,â however, the verses of the
Mirour

have an unmistakably English rhythm and may easily be distinguished
from French verse of the Continent and from that of the earlier
Anglo-Norman writers. One of the reasons for this is that the verse is
in a certain sense accentual as well as syllabic, the writer imposing
upon himself generally the rule of the alternate
[Pg xlvi]
beat of accents and
seldom allowing absolutely weak syllables
[J]
to stand in the even
places of his verse. Lines such as these of ChrÃ©tien de Troyes,

âSi ne semble pas qui la voit

Quâele puisse grant fÃ¨s porter,â

and these of FrÃ¨re Angier,

âSes merites et ses vertuz,

Ses jeÃ¼nes, ses oreisons,

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

Et sa volontaire poverte

Od trestote sâautre desserte,â

are quite in accordance with the rules of French verse, but
very few such lines will be found in the
Mirour
. Some there are,
no doubt, as 3327:

âDâenvie entre la laie gent,â

or 3645:

âQue nuls en poet estre garny.â

So also 2925, 3069, 4310 &c., but they are exceptional and
attract our notice when they occur. An illustration of the difference
between the usage of our author and that of the Continent is afforded
by the manner in which he quotes from HÃ©linandâs
Vers de la
Mort
. The text as given in the
Hist. Litt. de la France
,
xviii. p. 88, is as follows (with correction of the false reading
âcuevreâ):

âTex me couve dessous ses dras,

Qui cuide estre tous fors et sains.â

Gower has it

âCar tiel me couve soubz ses dras,

Qâassetz quide estre fortz et seins.â

He may have found this reading in the original, of which
there are several variants, but the comparison will none the less
illustrate the difference of the rhythms.

Subject-matter and Style.
âThe scheme of the
Speculum
Hominis
is, as before stated, of a very ambitious character. It
is intended to cover the whole field of manâs religious and moral
nature, to set forth the purposes of Providence in dealing with him,
the various degrees of human society and the faults chargeable to each
class of men, and finally the method which
[Pg xlvii]
should be followed by man
in order to reconcile himself with the God whom he has offended by his
sin. This is evidently one of those all-comprehending plans to which
nothing comes amiss; the whole miscellany of the authorâs ideas and
knowledge, whether derived from books or from life, might be poured
into it and yet fail to fill it up. Nevertheless the work is not an
undigested mass: it has a certain unity of its own,âindeed in regard
to connexion of parts it is superior to most medieval works of the
kind. The author has at least thought out his plan, and he carries it
through to the end in a laboriously conscientious manner. M. Jusserand
in his
Literary History of the English People
conjectured
reasonably enough that if this work should ever be discovered, it would
prove to be one of those tirades on the vices of the age which in
French were known as âbibles.â It is this and much more than this. In
fact it combines the three principal species of moral compositions all
in one framework,âthe manual of vices and virtues, the attack on the
evils of existing society from the highest place downwards, and finally
the versified summary of Scripture history and legend, introduced
here with a view to the exaltation and praise of the Virgin. In its
first division, which extends over nearly two-thirds of the whole,
our authorâs work somewhat resembles those of FrÃ¨re Lorenz, William
of Waddington and other writers, who compiled books intended to be of
practical use to persons preparing for confession. For those who are
in the habit of constant and minute self-examination it is necessary
that there should be a distinct classification of the forms of error
to which they may be supposed to be liable, and sins must be arranged
under headings which will help the memory to recall them and to run
over them rapidly. The classification which is based upon the seven
mortal sins is both convenient and rational, and such books as the

Somme des Vices et des Vertus
and the
Manuel des Pechiez
,
with the English translations or adaptations of them, were composed
for practical purposes. While resembling these in some respects, our
authorâs work is not exactly of the same character. Their object is
devotional, and form is sacrificed to utility. This is obvious in the
case of the first-named book, the original, as is well known, of the

Ayenbite of Inwyt
and of Chaucerâs
Persones Tale
, and it
is also true of the
Manuel des Pechiez
, though that is written
in verse
[Pg xlviii]
and has stories intermingled with the moral rules by way of
illustration. The author of this work states his purpose at once on
setting forth:

âLa vertu del seint espirit

Nus seit eidant en cest escrit,

A vus les choses ben mustrer,

Dunt hom se deit confesser,

E ausi en la quele manere.â

Upon which he proceeds to enumerate the various subjects
of which he thinks it useful to treat, which are connected by no tie
except that of practical convenience: âFirst we shall declare the true
faith, which is the foundation of our law.... Next we shall place the
commandments, which every one ought to keep; then the seven mortal
sins, whence spring so many evils.... Then you will find, if you
please, the seven sacraments of the Church, then a sermon, and finally
a book on confession, which will be suitable for every one.â

On the other hand the
Mirour de lâomme
is a literary production,
or at least aspires to that character, and as such it has more
regularity of form, more ornaments of style, and more display of
reading. The division and classification in this first part, which
treats of vices and of virtues, have a symmetrical uniformity; instead
of enumerating or endeavouring to enumerate all the subdivisions under
each head, all the numerous and irregularly growing branches and twigs
which spring from each stem, the author confines himself to those that
suit his plan, and constructs his whole edifice on a perfectly regular
system. The work is in fact so far not a manual of devotion, but rather
a religious allegory. The second part, which is ingeniously brought
into connexion with the same general plan, resembles, as has been
said, such compositions as the
Bible Guiot de Provins
, except
that it is very much longer and goes into far more elaborate detail
on the various classes of society and their distinctive errors. Here
the author speaks more from his own observation and less from books
than in the earlier part of his poem, and consequently this division
is more original and interesting. Many parts of it will serve usefully
to confirm the testimony of other writers, and from some the careful
student of manners will be able to glean new facts. The last 2,500
lines, a mere trifle compared with the bulk of the whole, contain a
Life of the Virgin, as the principal mediator between God
[Pg xlix]
and man, and
the book ends (at least as we have it) with not unpoetical praises and
prayers addressed to her.

It remains to be seen how the whole is pieced together.

Sin, we are told, is the cause of all evils, and brought about first
the fall of Lucifer and of his following from Heaven, and then the
expulsion of Adam from Paradise. In a certain sense Sin existed before
all created things, being in fact that void or chaos which preceded
creation, but also she was a daughter conceived by the Devil, who
upon her engendered Death (1-216). Death and Sin then intermarrying
produced the seven deadly Vices, whose names are enumerated, and the
Devil, delighted by his progeny, sent Sin and her seven daughters to
gain over the World to his side, and then called a conference with a
view to defeating the designs of Providence for the salvation of Man,
and of consummating the ruin which had already been in part effected
(217-396). They resolved to send Temptation as a messenger to Man, and
invite him to meet the Devil and his council, who would propose to him
something from which he would get great advantage. He came, but before
his coming Death had been cunningly hidden away in an inner chamber,
so that Man might not see him and be dismayed. The Devil, Sin and the
World successively addressed him with their promises, and Temptation,
the envoy, added his persuasion, so that at length the Flesh of Man
consented to be ruled by their counsels. The Soul, however, rejected
them and vehemently expostulated with the Flesh, who was thus resolved
to follow a course which would in the end ruin them both (397-612).
The Flesh wavered and was in part dismayed, but was unable altogether
to give up the promised delights; upon which the Soul informed her
of Death, who had been treacherously concealed from her view, and to
counteract the renewed enticements of Sin called in Reason and Fear
to convince the Flesh of her folly. Reason was overcome in argument
by Temptation, but Fear took the Flesh by the hand and led her to the
place where Death lay concealed. The Flesh trembled at sight of this
horrid creature, and Conscience led her back to Reason, who brought
her into agreement with the Soul, and thus for the time the designs
of the Devil and of Sin were frustrated (613-756). The Devil demanded
that Sin should devise some remedy, and she consulted with the World,
who proposed marriage between himself and the seven daughters of Sin,
in order that from them offspring might be
[Pg l]
produced by means of which
Man might the more readily be overcome. The marriage was arranged
and the daughters of Sin went in procession to their wedding. Each
in turn was taken in marriage by the World, and of them the first
was Pride (757-1056). By her he had five daughters, each of whom is
described at length, namely Hypocrisy, Vainglory, Arrogance, Boasting
and Disobedience, and lastly comes the description of Pride herself
(1057-2616). The same order is observed with regard to the rest. The
daughters of Envy are Detraction, Sorrow for othersâ Joy, Joy for
othersâ Grief, Supplanting and Treachery (Fals semblant) (2617-3852).
Anger has for her daughters Melancholy, Contention, Hatred, Strife,
and Homicide (3853-5124). Sloth produces Somnolence, Laziness (or
Pusillanimity), Slackness, Idleness, Negligence (5125-6180). Avarice
bears Covetousness, Rapine, Usury, Simony and Niggardy (6181-7704).
Gluttonyâs daughters are Voracity, Delicacy, Drunkenness, Superfluity,
Prodigality (7705-8616). Finally, Lechery is the mother of Fornication,
Rape, Adultery, Incest and Vain-delight (8617-9720). The Devil
assembled all the progeny of the Vices and demanded the fulfilment of
the promise made by the World, that Man should be made subject to him,
and they all together made such a violent attack upon Man, that he
surrendered himself to their guidance and came to be completely in the
power of Sin, whose evil influence is described (9721-10032). Reason
and Conscience prayed to God for assistance against the Vices and
their progeny, and God gave seven Virtues, the contraries of the seven
Vices, in marriage to Reason, in order that thence offspring might be
born which might contend with that of the Vices (10033-10176). Each
of these, as may readily be supposed, had five daughters. Humility,
who is the natural enemy of Pride, produced Devotion to set against
Hypocrisy, Fear against Vainglory, Discretion against Arrogance,
Modesty against Boasting, and Obedience against Disobedience, and
after the description of all these in succession follows that of
Humility herself (10177-12612). So of the rest; the five daughters of
Charity, namely Praise, Congratulation, Compassion, Help and Goodwill,
are opposed each in her turn to the daughters of Envy, as Charity is
to Envy herself (12613-13380). Patience, the opponent of Anger, has
for her daughters Good-temper, Gentleness, Affection, Agreement and
Mercy (13381-14100). Prowess, the opposite of Sloth, is the mother
of
[Pg li]
Watchfulness, Magnanimity, Resolution, Activity and Learning (or
Knowledge), to the description of which last is added an exhortation to
self-knowledge and confession of sins (14101-15180). Generosity, the
contrary of Avarice, produces Justice, Liberality, Alms-giving, Largess
and Holy-purpose, this fifth daughter being the opposite of Simony,
the fourth daughter of Avarice, as Largess is of Niggardy, the fifth
(15181-16212). Measure, the contrary of Gluttony, is the mother of
Dieting, Abstinence, Nourishment, Sobriety, Moderation (16213-16572).
Chastity, the enemy of Lechery, has for her daughters Good-care
(against Fornication), Virginity, Matrimony, Continence and Hard-life
(16573-18372).

Let us now, says our author, observe the issue of this strife for
the conquest of Man, in which the Flesh inclines to the side of the
Vices, and the Soul to that of Reason and the Virtues. We must examine
the whole of human society, from the Court of Rome downwards, to
decide which has gained the victory up to this time, and for my part
I declare that Sin is the strongest power in this world and directs
all things after her will and pleasure (18373-18420). Every estate
of Man, therefore, is passed in review and condemnedâthe Pope and
the Cardinals (18421-19056), the Bishops (19057-20088), the lower
dignitaries of the Church, Archdeacons and others (20089-20208), the
parish priests, the chantry priests, and those preparing for the
priesthood (20209-20832), the members of religious orders, first the
monks and then the friars (20833-21780), the secular rulers of the
world, Emperors and Kings (21781-23208), great lords (23209-23592),
knights and men of arms (23593-24180), the men of the law, pleaders and
judges (24181-24816), the sheriffs, reeves and jurymen (24817-25176),
the class of merchants and traders (25177-25500), that of artificers
(25501-25980), victuallers (25981-26424), labourers (26425-26520). In
short, all estates have become corrupted; whether the lay people are
more to blame for it or the priests the author will not say, but all
agree in throwing the blame on the world (or the age) and in excusing
themselves (26521-26604). He addresses the world and asks whence comes
all the evil of which he complains. Is it from earth, water, air or
fire? No, all these are good in themselves. Is it from the heavenly
bodies, sun, moon, stars, planet or comet? No, for the prayer of a
good man can overcome all their influences. Is it from plants, birds,
or beasts? But these all follow nature and do good.
[Pg lii]
From what then
is this evil? It is surely from that creature to whom God has given
reason and submitted all things on earth, but who transgresses against
God and does not follow the rules of reason. It is from Man that all
the evils of the age arise, and we read in prophecy that for the sin
of Man all the world, with the creatures which it contains, shall be
troubled. Man is a microcosm, an abridgement of the world, and it is no
wonder that all the elements should be disturbed when he transgresses
(26605-26964). On the other hand the good and just man can command the
elements and the powers of the material world, as Joshua commanded
the sun and moon to stand still and as the saints have done at all
times by miracles, and he is victorious at last even over Death, and
attains to immortality by the grace of God (26965-27120). Surely, then,
every man ought to desire to repent of his sin and to turn to God,
that so the world may be amended and we may inherit eternal life. The
author confesses himself to be as great a sinner as any man; but hope
is his shield by the aid and mercy of Jesus Christ, notwithstanding
that he has so idly wasted his life and comes so late to repentance
(27121-27360). But how can he escape from his sins, how can he dare
to pray, with what can he come before his God? Only by the help of
his Lady of Pity, Mary, maid and mother, who will intercede for him
if he can obtain her favour. Therefore he desires, before finishing
his task, to tell of her conception and birth, her life and her death
(27361-27480). Upon this follows the tale of the Nativity of the
Virgin, as we find it (for example) in the
Legenda Aurea
, her
childhood and espousal, the Nativity of Jesus Christ and the joys of
our Lady, the Circumcision and the Purification, the baptism of our
Lord, his miracles and his passion, the Resurrection, the sorrows of
our Lady and her joys, the Ascension and the descent of the Spirit,
the life of the Virgin Mary with St. John, her death, burial, and
assumption; and the poet concludes his narrative with a prayer to both
Son and Mother that they will have mercy upon his pain because of the
pains which they themselves suffered, and give him that joy in which
they now rejoice. Especially he is bound to celebrate the praise of
his Lady, who is so gentle and fair and so near to God who redeemed us
(27481-29904). He begins therefore to tell first of the names by which
she is called, and with the praises of her, no doubt, he ended his
book, which, as we have it, breaks off at l. 29945.

[Pg liii]

This, it will be seen, is a literary work with due connexion of parts,
and not a mere string of sermons. At the same time it must be said that
the descriptions of vices and virtues are of such inordinate length
that the effect of unity which should be produced by a well-planned
design is almost completely lost, and the book becomes very tiresome to
read. We are wearied also by the accumulation of texts and authorities
and by the unqualified character of the moral judgements. The maxim in
l. 25225,

âLes bons sont bons, les mals sont mals,â

is thoroughly characteristic of Gower, and on the strength
of it he holds a kind of perpetual Last Judgement, in which he is
always engaged in separating the sheep from the goats and dealing out
to the latter their doom of eternal fire. The sentence sounds like a
truism, but it contains in fact one of the grossest of fallacies. In
short, our author has little sense of proportion and no dramatic powers.

As regards the invention of his allegory he seems to be to some extent
original. There is nothing, so far as I know, to which we can point
as its source, and such as it is, he is apparently entitled to the
credit of having conceived it. The materials, no doubt, were ready
to his hand. Allegory was entirely in the taste of the fourteenth
century, dominated as it was by the influence of the
Roman de la
Rose
, from which several of Gowerâs personifications are taken.
The
Mariage des Sept Arts
was a work of this period, and the
marriage of the Deadly Sins was not by any means a new idea. For
example in MS. Fairfax 24 (Bodleian Libr.) there is a part of a French
poem âde Maritagio nouem filiarum diaboli,â which begins,

âLi deable se vout marier,

MauveistÃ© prist a sa moiller:

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

De ceste ix filles engendra

Et diversement les marya,â &c.

And no doubt other pieces of a similar kind exist.

The same is true as regards the other parts of the book, as has been
already pointed out; the combination alone is original.

The style is uniformly respectable, but as a rule very monotonous.
Occasionally the tedium is relieved by a story, but
[Pg liv]
it is not
generally told in much detail, and for the most part the reader has
to toil through the desert with little assistance. It must not be
supposed, however, that the work is quite without poetical merit. Every
now and then by some touch of description the author betrays himself as
the graceful poet of the
Balades
, his better part being crushed
under mountains of morality and piles of deadly learning, but surviving
nevertheless. For example, the priest who neglects his early morning
service is reminded of the example of the lark, who rising very early
mounts circling upward and pours forth a service of praise to God from
her little throat:

âCar que lâen doit sanz nul destour

Loenge rendre au creatour

Essample avons de lâalouette,

Que bien matin de tour en tour

Monte, et de dieu volant entour

Les laudes chante en sa gorgette.â (5635 ff.)

Again, Praise is like the bee which flies over the meadows in the
sunshine, gathering that which is sweet and fragrant, but avoiding all
evil odours (12853 ff.). The robe of Conscience is like a cloud with
ever-changing hues (10114 ff.). Devotion is like the sea-shell which
opens to the dew of heaven and thus conceives the fair white pearl; not
an original idea, but gracefully expressed:

âSi en resÃ§oit le douls rosÃ©,

Que chiet du ciel tout en celÃ©e,

Dont puis deinz soi ad engendrÃ©

La margarite blanche et fine;

Ensi Devocioun en dÃ©e

Conceipt, sâelle est continuÃ©,

La Contemplacioun divine.â (10818 ff.)

The lines in which our author describes the life of the beggar show
that, though he disapproves, he has a real understanding of the
delights of vagabondage, with its enjoyment of the open-air life, the
sunshine, the woods, and the laziness:

âCar mieulx amont la soule mie

Ove lâaise qâest appartenant,

Câest du solail qâest eschaulfant,

Et du sachel acostoiant,

Et du buisson lâerbergerie,

Que labourer pour leur vivantâ &c. (5801 ff.)

Other descriptions also have merit, as for example that of the
[Pg lv]

procession of the Vices to their wedding, each being arrayed and
mounted characteristically (841 ff.), a scene which it is interesting
to compare with the somewhat similar passage of Spenser,
Faery
Queene
, i. 4, that of Murder rocked in her cradle by the Devil
and fed with milk of death (4795), and that of Fortune smiling on her
friends and frowning on her enemies (22081 ff.).

Contemplation is described as one who loves solitude and withdraws
herself from the sight, but it is not that she may be quite alone:
she is like the maiden who in a solitary place awaits her lover, by
whose coming she is to have joy in secret (10597 ff.). The truly
religious man, already dead in spirit to this world, desires the
death of the body âmore than the mariner longs for his safe port,
more than the labourer desires his wage, the husbandman his harvest,
or the vine-dresser his vintage, more than the prisoner longs for
his ransoming and deliverance, or the pilgrim who has travelled far
desires his home-comingâ (10645 ff.). Such passages as these show both
imagination and the power of literary expression, and the stanzas which
describe the agony of the Saviour are not wholly unworthy of their high
subject:

âPar ce qâil ot le corps humein

Et vist la mort devant la mein,

Tant durement il sâeffroia,

Du quoy parmy le tendre grein

Du char les gouttes trestout plein

Du sanc et eaue alors sua;

Si dist: O piere, entendes Ã§a,

Fai que la mort me passera,

Car tu sur tout es soverein;

Et nepourqant je vuil cela

Que vous vuilletz que fait serra,

Car je me tiens a toy certein.â (28669 ff.)

The man who wrote this not only showed some idea of the dignified
handling of a tragic theme, but also had considerable mastery over
the instruments that he used; and in fact the technical skill with
which the stanza is used is often remarkable. There is sometimes a
completeness and finish about it which takes us by surprise. The
directions which our author gives us for a due confession of our sins
are not exactly poetical, but the manner in which all the various
points of
Quomodo
are wrapped up in a stanza, and rounded off at
the end of it (14869 ff.) is decidedly neat; and the same may be said
of the
[Pg lvi]
reference to the lives of the holy fathers, as illustrating the
nature of âAspre vieâ:

âQui list les vies des saintz pieres,

OÃ¯r y puet maintes manieres

De la nature dâAspre vie:

Les uns souleins en les rocheres,

Les uns en cloistre ove lour confreres,

Chascun fist bien de sa partie;

Cil plourt, cist preche, cil dieu prie,

Cist june et veille, et cil chastie

Son corps du froid et des miseres,

Cist laist sa terre et manantie,

Cil laist sa femme et progenie,

Eiant sur tout leur almes cheres.â (18253 ff.)

In fact, he is a poet in a different sense altogether from his
predecessors, superior to former Anglo-Norman writers both in
imagination and in technical skill; but at the same time he is
hopelessly unreadable, so far as this book as a whole is concerned,
because, having been seized by the fatal desire to do good in his
generation, âvillicacionis sue racionem, dum tempus instat, ...
alleuiare cupiens,â as he himself expresses it, he deliberately
determined to smother those gifts which had been employed in the
service of folly, and to become a preacher instead of a poet. Happily,
as time went on, he saw reason to modify his views in this respect (as
he tells us plainly in the
Confessio Amantis
), and he became a
poet again; but meanwhile he remains a preacher, and not a very good
one after all.

Quotations.
âOne of the characteristic features of the

Mirour
is the immense number of quotations. This citation of
authorities is of course a characteristic of medieval morality, and
appears in some books, as in the
Liber Consolationis
and other
writings of Albertano of Brescia, in an extreme form. Here the tendency
is very pronounced, especially in the part which treats of Vices and
Virtues, and it is worth while to inquire what range of reading they
really indicate. A very large number are from the Bible, and there can
be little doubt that Gower knew the Bible, in the Vulgate version of
course, thoroughly well. There is hardly a book of the Old Testament
to which he does not refer, and he seems to be acquainted with Bible
history even in its obscurest details. The books from which he most
frequently quotes are
Job
,
Psalms
,
Proverbs
,

Isaiah
,
Jeremiah
, and
Ecclesiasticus
, the
proverbial morality of this last book
[Pg lvii]
being especially congenial to
him. The quotations are sometimes inexact, and occasionally assigned to
the wrong book; also the book of
Ecclesiasticus
, which is quoted
very frequently, is sometimes referred to under the name of Sidrac and
sometimes of Solomon: but there can be no doubt in my opinion that
these Biblical quotations are at first hand. Of other writers Seneca,
who is quoted by name nearly thirty times, comes easily first. Some
of the references to him seem to be false, but it is possible that
our author had read some of his works. Then come several of the Latin
fathers, Jerome, Augustin, Gregory, Bernard, and, not far behind these,
Ambrose. The quotations are not always easy to verify, and in most
cases there is nothing to indicate that the books from which they are
taken had been read as a whole. No doubt Gower may have been acquainted
with some portions of them, as for instance that part of Jeromeâs book
against Jovinian which treats of the objections to marriage, but it
is likely enough that he picked up most of these quotations at second
hand. There are about a dozen quotations from Cicero, mostly from the

De Officiis
and
De Amicitia
, but I doubt whether he had
read either of these books. In the
Confessio Amantis
he speaks
as if he did not know that Tullius was the same person as Cicero (iv.
2648). Boethius is cited four times, one of the references being
false; Cassiodorus and Isidore each four times, and Bede three times.
Stories of natural history seem to be referred rather indiscriminately
to Solinus, for several of these references prove to be false. Three
quotations are attributed by the author to Horace (âOraceâ), but of
these one is in fact from Ovid and another from Juvenal. He certainly
got them all from some book of commonplaces. The same may be said of
the passage alleged to be from Quintilian and of the references to
Aristotle and to Plato. âMarcial,â who is quoted three times, is not
the classical Martial, but the epigrammatist Godfrey of Winchester,
whose writings were in imitation of the Roman poet and passed commonly
under his name. The distichs of Cato are referred to five times,
and it is certain of course that Gower had read them. Ovid is named
only once, and that is a doubtful reference, but the author of the

Confessio Amantis
was certainly well acquainted at least with
the
Metamorphoses
and the
Heroides
. Valerius Maximus
is the authority for two stories, but it is doubtful whether he is
quoted at first hand. Fulgentius is cited twice, and âAlphonses,â
[Pg lviii]

that is Petrus Alphonsi, author of the
Disciplina Clericalis
,
twice. âPamphiliusâ (i.e.
Pamphilus, de Amore
) is cited once,
but not in such a way as to suggest that Gower knew the book itself;
and so too Maximian, but the passage referred to does not seem to
be in the
Elegies
. The quotation from Ptolemy is, as usual,
from the maxims often prefixed in manuscripts to the
Almagest
.
Other writers referred to are Chrysostom, Cyprian, Remigius, Albertus
Magnus, HÃ©linand, Haymo, and Gilbert. We know from a passage in
the
Confessio Amantis
that Gower had read some of the works
of Albertus, and we may assume as probable that he knew Gilbertâs

Opusculum de Virginitate
, for his reference is rather to the
treatise generally than to any particular passage of it.

He was acquainted, no doubt, with the
Legenda Aurea
or some
similar collection, and he seems to refer also to the
Vitae
Patrum
. The moral and devotional books of his own day must have
been pretty well known to him, as well as the lighter literature, to
which he had himself contributed (
Mir.
27340). On the whole we
must conclude that he was a well-read man according to the standard of
his age, especially for a layman, but there is no need to attribute to
him a vast stock of learning on the strength of the large number of
authors whom he quotes.

Proverbs, &c.
âBesides quotations from books there will be
found to be a number of proverbial sayings in the
Mirour
, and I
have thought it useful to collect some of these and display them in a
manner convenient for reference. They are given in the order in which
they occur:

Akin to the proverbs are the illustrations from Natural History,
real or fictitious, of which there is a considerable number in the

Mirour
. These are of very various classes, from simple facts of
ordinary observation to the monstrous inventions of the Bestiaries,
which were repeated by one writer after another with a faith which
rested not on any evidence of the facts stated, but upon their
supposed agreement with the fitness of things, that is, practically,
their supposed aptness as moral lessons, the medieval idea of the
animal world being apparently that it was created and kept in being
largely for the instruction of mankind. In taking the glow-worm as
an illustration of hypocrisy (1130), the lark of joyous thankfulness
(5637), the grasshopper of improvidence (5821), the lapwing of female
dissimulation (8869), the turtle-dove of constancy (17881), the drone
of indolence (5437), the camel of revengeful malice (4417), and the
blind kitten of drunken helplessness (8221), the author is merely
making a literary use of every-day observation. There are however,
as might be expected, plenty of illustrations of a more questionable
character. Presumption is like the tiger beguiled with the mirror
(1561); the proud man who is disobedient to law is like the unicorn,
which cannot be tamed (2101); the devil breaking down the virtue of a
man by raising him high in his own conceit is like the osprey, which
carries bones high in the air and breaks them by dropping them upon
rocks (1849); Envy, who destroys with her breath the honour of all
around her, is like the basilisk which kills all vegetation in the
place where it is found (3745); the man-faced bird, which pines away
because it has slain a man, is produced as a lesson to murderers
[Pg lxi]

(5029); the bad father, who teaches his sons to plunder the poor, is
like the hawk, which beats its young and drives them from the nest
in order that they may learn to kill prey for themselves (7009); the
partridge is a lesson against stinginess (7671); the contagiousness of
sin is illustrated by the fact that the panther infects other animals
with his spots (9253), and yet in another place (12865) the sweetness
of the human voice when it utters praise is compared to the fragrance
of the pantherâs breath. Contemplation is like the âchalandre,â
which flies up at midnight to the sky, and when on the earth will
not look upon a dying person (10705); the fight between Arimaspians
and griffons for emeralds is an image created for our instruction of
the contest between the soul of man and the devil (10717); Devotion,
who opens herself secretly to heaven and thus attains to the divine
contemplation, is like the sea-shell which opens to the dew by night
and from it conceives the pearl (10813); the spittle of a fasting man
(according to Ambrose) will kill a serpent, and the fast itself will no
doubt be effectual against the old serpent our enemy (18025). The bee
does not come off well on the whole in these comparisons: he is chosen
as the likeness of the idle and luxurious prelate, but this is for
reasons which are not in themselves at all obvious, except that he has
a sting and is unduly fond of sweets (19345). The prelate who protects
his flock from encroachments of the royal or other authority is like
the big fish which takes the smaller into its mouth to shelter them
from the storm (19909); Humility is like the diamond, which refuses a
setting of gold, but is drawn to the lowly iron, a confusion with the
load-stone, arising from the name âadamantâ applied to both (12463).
These are some of the illustrations which are drawn from the domain of
Natural History, not original for the most part, but worth noting as
part of the literary baggage of the period.

The Author and his Times.
âWe may gather from the

Mirour
some few facts about the personality of the author, which
will serve to supplement in some degree our rather scanty knowledge of
Gowerâs life. He tells us here that he is a layman (21772), but that we
knew already; and that he knows little Latin and little French,ââPoi
sai latin, poi sai romanceâ (21775), but that is only his modesty;
he knows quite enough of both. He has spent his life in what he now
regards as folly or
[Pg lxii]
worse; he has committed all the seven deadly
sins (27365); moreover he has composed love poems, which he now calls
âfols ditz dâamourâ (27340); but for all this it is probable enough
that his life has been highly respectable. He comes late to repentance
(27299), and means to sing a song different from that which he has sung
heretofore (27347), to atone, apparently, for his former misdeeds. We
may assume, then, that he was not very young at the time when he wrote
this book; and we know that he considered himself an old man when he
produced the
Confessio Amantis
(viii. 3068*) in the year 1390.
Men were counted old before sixty in those days, and therefore we may
suppose him to be now about forty-six. We may perhaps gather from ll.
8794 and 17649 that he had a wife. In the former passage he is speaking
of those who tell tales to husbands about their wivesâ misconduct,
and he says in effect, âI for my part declare (Je di pour moi) that I
wish to hear no such tales of
my
wifeâ; in the second he speaks
of those wives who dislike servants and other persons simply because
their husbands like them, and he adds, âI do not say that mine does
so,â âNe di pas qâensi fait la moie.â If the inference is correct, then
his union with Agnes Groundolf in his old age was a second marriage,
and this is in itself probable enough. We cannot come to any definite
conclusion from this poem about his profession or occupation in life.
It is said by Leland that Gower was a lawyer, but for this statement no
evidence has ever been produced, and if we may judge from the tone in
which he speaks of the law and lawyers in the
Mirour
, we must
reject it. Of all the secular estates that of the law seems to him to
be the worst (24805 ff.), and he condemns both advocates and judges
in a more unqualified manner than the members of any other calling.
He knows apparently a good deal about them and about the âcustoms of
Westminster,â but, judging by his tone, we shall probably be led to
think that this knowledge was acquired rather in the character of a
litigant than in that of a member of the legal profession. Especially
the suggestion of a special tax to be levied on lawyersâ gains (24337
ff.) is one which could hardly have come from one who was himself
a lawyer. Again, the way in which he speaks of physicians, whom he
accuses of being in league with apothecaries to defraud patients, and
of deliberately delaying the cure in order to make more money (24301,
25621 ff.), seems to
[Pg lxiii]
exclude him quite as clearly from the profession
of medicine, the condemnation being here again general and unqualified.

Of all the various ranks of society which he reviews, that of which
he seems to speak with most respect is the estate of Merchants. He
takes pains to point out both here and in the
Vox Clamantis

the utility of their occupation and the justice of their claim to
reasonably large profits on successful ventures in consideration of
the risks which they run (25177 ff.). He makes a special apology to
the honest members of the class for exposing the abuses to which the
occupation is liable, pleading that to blame the bad is in effect to
praise the good (25213 ff., 25975 ff.), and he is more careful here
than elsewhere to point out the fact that honest members of the class
exist. These indications seem to suggest that it was as a merchant
that Gower made the money which he spent in buying his land; and
this inference is supported by the manner in which he speaks of âour
City,â and by the fact that it is with members of the merchant class
that he seems to be most in personal communication. He has evidently
discussed with merchants the comparative value of worldly and spiritual
possessions, and he reports the saying of one of them,

âDont un me disoit lâautre jour,â

to the effect that he was a fool who did not make money
if he might, for no one knew the truth about the world to come (25915
ff.). He feels strongly against a certain bad citizen who aims at
giving privileges in trade to outsiders (26380 ff.), and the jealousy
of the Lombards which he expresses (25429 ff.) has every appearance of
being a prejudice connected with rivalry in commerce. âI see Lombards
come,â he says, âin poor attire as servants, and before a year has
passed they have gained so much by deceit and conspiracy that they
dress more nobly than the burgesses of our City; and if they need
influence or friendship, they gain it by fraud and subtlety, so that
their interests are promoted and ours are damaged at their will and
pleasure.â

If we are to go further and ask in what branch of trade our author
exercised himself, it is probable that we may see reason to set him
down as a dealer in wool, so enthusiastic is he about wool as the first
of all commodities, and so much has he to say about the abuses of the
staple (25360 ff.). No
[Pg lxiv]
doubt the business of exporting wool would be
combined with that of importing foreign manufactured goods of some
kind. It is known from other sources that Gower was a man who gradually
acquired considerable property in land, and the references in the

Mirour
to the dearness of labour and the unreasonable demands of
the labourer (24625 ff.) are what we might expect from a man in that
position.

He tells us that he is a man of simple tastes, that he does not care
to have âpartridges, pheasants, plovers, and swansâ served up at his
table (26293 ff.); that he objects however to finding his simple joint
of meat stuck full of wooden skewers by the butcher, so that when he
comes to carve it he blunts the edge of his knife (26237 ff.). We
know moreover from the whole tone of his writings that he is a just
and upright man, who believes in the due subordination of the various
members of society to one another, and who will not allow himself to
be ruled in his own household either by his wife or his servants. He
thinks indeed that the patience of Socrates is much overstrained, and
openly declares that he shall not imitate it:

âQui ceste essample voet tenir

Avise soy; car sans mentir

Je ne serray si pacient.â (4186 ff.)

But, though a thorough believer in the principle of
gradation in human society, he emphasizes constantly the equality of
all men before God and refuses absolutely to admit the accident of
birth as constituting any claim whatever to âgentilesce.â The common
descent of all from Adam is as conclusive on this point for him as
it was for John Ball (23389 ff.), and he is not less clear and sound
on the subject of wealth. Considering that his views of society are
essentially the same as those of Wycliff, and considering also his
strong views about the corruption of the Church and the misdeeds of the
friars, it is curious to find how strongly he denounces âlollardieâ in
his later writings.

He has a just abhorrence of war, and draws a very clear-sighted
distinction between the debased chivalry of his day and the true ideal
of knighthood, the one moved only by impulses of vainglorious pride and
love of paramours,

âCar dâorguil ou du foldelit,

Au jour present, sicomme lâen dist,

Chivalerie est maintenue.â (23986 ff.)

[Pg lxv]

and the other, set only on serving God and righting the
wrong, represented finely in the character of Prowess:

âIl ad delit sanz fol amour,

Proufit sanz tricher son prochein,

Honour sanz orguillous atour.â (15176 ff.)

Above all, our author has a deep sense of religion, and his study has
been much upon the Bible. He deeply believes in the moral government of
the world by Providence, and he feels sure, as others of his age also
did, that the world has almost reached its final stage of corruption.
Whatever others may do, he at least intends to repent of his sins and
prepare himself to render a good account of his stewardship.

Let us pass now from the person of the author and touch upon some of
those illustrations of the manners of the time which are furnished by
the
Mirour
. In the first place it may be said that in certain
points, and especially in what is said of the Court of Rome and the
Mendicant orders, it fully confirms the unfavourable impression which
we get from other writers of the time. Gower has no scruples at any
time in denouncing the temporal possessions of the Church as the root
of almost all the evil in her, and here as elsewhere he tells the story
of the donation of Constantine, with the addition of the angelic voice
which foretold disaster to spring from it. Of dispensations, which
allow men to commit sin with impunity, he takes a very sound view. Not
even God, he says, can grant this, which the Pope claims the power to
grant (18493). The Mendicant friars are for him those âfalse prophetsâ
of whom the Gospel spoke, who should come in sheepâs clothing, while
inwardly they were ravening wolves. He denounces their worldliness
in the strongest language, and the account of their visits to poor
womenâs houses, taking a farthing if they cannot get a penny, or a
single egg if nothing else is forthcoming (21379), reminds us vividly
of Chaucerâs picture of a similar scene. But in fact the whole of the
Church seems to our author to be in a wrong state. He does not relieve
his picture of it by any such pleasing exception as the parish priest
of the
Canterbury Tales
. He thinks that it needs reform from
the top to the bottom; the clergy of the parish churches are almost as
much to blame as the prelates, monks and friars, and for him it is the
[Pg lxvi]

corruption of the Church that is mainly responsible for the decadence
of society (21685 ff.). These views he continued to hold throughout his
life, and yet he apparently had no sympathy whatever with Lollardism
(
Conf. Am. Prol.
346 ff. and elsewhere). His witness against the
Church comes from one who is entirely untainted by schism. Especially
he is to be listened to when he complains how the archdeacons and their
officers abuse the trust committed to them for the correction of vices
in the clergy and in the laity. With the clergy it is a case of âhuy
a moy, demain a vousââthat is, the archdeacon or dean, being immoral
himself, winks at the vices of the clergy in order that his own may
be overlooked; the clergy, in fact, are judges in their own cause,
and they stand or fall together. If, however, an unfortunate layman
offends, they accuse him forthwith, in order to profit by the penalties
that may be exacted. âPurs is the erchedeknes helle,â as Chaucerâs
Sompnour says, and Gower declares plainly that the Church officials
encourage vice in order that they may profit by it: âthe harlot is
more profitable to them,â he says, âthan the nun, and they let out
fornication to farm, as they let their landsâ (20149 ff.).

Setting aside the Church, we may glean from the
Mirour
some
interesting details about general society, especially in the city of
London. There is a curious and life-like picture of the gatherings of
city dames at the wine-shop, whither with mincing steps they repair
instead of to church or to market, and how the vintner offers them the
choice of Vernazza and Malvoisie, wine of Candia and Romagna, Provence
and Monterossoânot that he has all these, but to tickle their fancies
and make them pay a higher priceâand draws ten kinds of liquor from
a single cask. Thus he makes his gain and they spend their husbandsâ
money (26077 ff.). We find too a very lively account of the various
devices of shopkeepers to attract custom and cheat their customers. The
mercer, for example, is louder than a sparrow-hawk in his cries; he
seizes on people in the street and drags them by force into his shop,
urging them merely to view his kerchiefs and his ostrich feathers,
his satins and foreign cloth (25285 ff.). The draper will try to sell
you cloth in a dark shop, where you can hardly tell blue from green,
and while making you pay double its value will persuade you that he
is giving it away because of his regard for you and desire
[Pg lxvii]
for your
acquaintance (25321 ff.). The goldsmith purloins the gold and silver
with which you supply him and puts a base alloy in its place; moreover,
if he has made a cup for you and you do not call for it at once, he
will probably sell it to the first comer as his own, and tell you that
yours was spoilt in the making and you must wait till he can make you
another (25513 ff.). The druggist not only makes profit out of sin
by selling paints and cosmetics to women, but joins in league with
the physician and charges exorbitantly for making up the simplest
prescription (25609 ff.). The furrier stretches the fur with which he
has to trim the mantle, so that after four daysâ wear it is obvious
that the cloth and the fur do not match one another (25705 ff.). Every
kind of food is adulterated and is sold by false weights and measures.
The baker is a scoundrel of course, and richly deserves hanging
(26189), but the butcher is also to blame, and especially because he
declines altogether to recognize the farthing as current coin and will
take nothing less than a penny, so that poor people can get no meat
(26227). Wines are mixed, coloured and adulterated; what they call
Rhenish probably grew on the banks of the Thames (26118). If you order
beer for your household, you get it good the first time and perhaps
also the second, but after that no more; and yet for the bad as high a
price is charged as for the good (26161 ff.). Merchants in these days
talk of thousands, where their fathers talked of scores or hundreds;
but their fathers lived honestly and paid their debts, while these
defraud all who have dealings with them. When you enter their houses,
you see tapestried rooms and curtained chambers, and they have fine
plate upon the tables, as if they were dukes; but when they die, they
are found to have spent all their substance, and their debts are left
unpaid (25813 ff.).

In the country the labourers are discontented and disagreeable. They do
less work and demand more pay than those of former times. In old days
the labourer never tasted wheaten bread and rarely had milk or cheese.
Things went better in those days. Now their condition is a constant
danger to society, and one to which the upper classes seem strangely
indifferent (26425 ff.).

Curious accounts are given of the customs of the legal profession, and
when our author comes to deal with the jury-panel,
[Pg lxviii]
he tells us of a
regularly established class of men whose occupation it is to arrange
for the due packing and bribing of juries. He asserts that of the
corrupt jurors there are certain captains, who are called âtracersâ
(
traiciers
), because they draw (
treront
) the others to
their will. If they say that white is black, the others will say âquite
so,â and swear it too, for as the tracer will have it, so it shall be.
Those persons who at assizes desire to have corrupt jurymen to try
their case must speak with these âtracers,â for all who are willing to
sell themselves in this manner are hand and glove with them, and so
the matter is arranged (25033 ff.). The existence of a definite name
for this class of undertakers seems to indicate that it was really an
established institution.

These are a few of the points which may interest the reader in the
reflection of the manners of society given by our authorâs âmirror.â
The whole presents a picture which, though no doubt somewhat
overcharged with gloom, is true nevertheless in its outlines.

Text.
âIt remains to speak of the text of this edition and of
the manuscript on which it depends.

In the year 1895, while engaged in searching libraries for MSS. of
the
Confessio Amantis
, I observed to Mr. Jenkinson, Librarian
of the Cambridge University Library, that if the lost French work of
Gower should ever be discovered, it would in all probability be found
to have the title
Speculum Hominis
, and not that of
Speculum
Meditantis
, under which it was ordinarily referred to. He at once
called my attention to the MS. with the title
Mirour de lâomme
,
which he had lately bought and presented to the University Library.
On examining this I was able to identify it beyond all doubt with the
missing book.

It may be thus described:

Camb. Univ. Library, MS. Additional 3035, bought at the Hailstone sale,
May 1891, and presented to the Library by the Librarian.

Written on parchment, size of leaves about 12â x 7Â¾â, in eights
with catchwords; writing of the latter half of the 14th century, in
double column of forty-eight lines to the column; initial letter of
each stanza coloured blue or red, and larger illuminated letters at
the beginning of the chief divisions, combined with some ornamentation
on the left side of the column, and in one case, f. 58 v
o
, also at
the top of the page. One leaf is pasted down to the binding at the
beginning and contains the title and table of
[Pg lxix]
contents. After this
four leaves have been cut out, containing the beginning of the poem,
and seven more in other parts of the book. There are also some leaves
lost at the end. The first leaf after those which have been cut out at
the beginning has the signature
a
iiii. The leaves (including
those cut out) have now been numbered 1, 1*, 2, 3, 4, &c., up to 162;
we have therefore a first sheet, of which half is pasted down (f. 1)
and the other half cut away (f. 1*), and then twenty quires of eight
leaves with the first leaf of the twenty-first quire, the leaves lost
being those numbered 1*, 2, 3, 4, 36, 106, 108, 109, 120, 123, 124, as
well as those after 162.

The present binding is of the last century and doubtless later than
1745, for some accounts of work done by âRichard Eldridgeâ and other
memoranda, written in the margins in an illiterate hand, have the dates
1740 and 1745 and have been partly cut away by the binder. The book was
formerly in the library of Edward Hailstone, Esq., whose name and arms
are displayed upon a leather label outside the binding, but it seems
that no record exists as to the place from which he obtained it. From
the writing in the margin of several pages it would seem that about
the year 1745 it was lying neglected in some farm-house. We have, for
example, this memorandum (partly cut away) in the margin of one of the
leaves: âMargat ... leved at James ... in the year of our Lord 1745
and was the dayre maid that year ... and her swithart name was Joshep
Cockhad Joshep Cockhad carpenter.â On the same page occurs the word
âglosterr,â which may partly serve to indicate the locality.

The manuscript is written in one hand throughout, with the exception
of the Table of Contents, and the writing is clear, with but few
contractions. In a few cases, as in ll. 4109, 4116, 28941 f.,
corrections have been made over erasure. The correctness of the text
which the MS. presents is shown by the very small number of cases
in which either metre or sense suggests emendation. Apart from the
division of words, only about thirty corrections have been made in the
present edition throughout the whole poem of nearly thirty thousand
lines, and most of these are very trifling. I have little doubt that
this copy was written under the direction of the author.

As regards the manner in which the text of the MS. has been reproduced
in this edition, I have followed on the whole the
[Pg lxx]
system used in
the publications of the âSociÃ©tÃ© des Anciens Textes FranÃ§ais.â Thus

u
and
v
,
i
and
j
, have been dealt with
in accordance with modern practice, whereas in the MS. (as usual in
French and English books of the time)
v
is regularly written
as the initial letter of a word for either
u
or
v
, and

u
in other positions (except sometimes in the case of compounds
like
avient
,
avoegler
,
envers
,
envie
,
&c.), while, as regards
i
and
j
, we have for initials
either
i
or
I
(
J
), and in other positions

i
. Thus the MS. has
vn
,
auoir
, while the text
gives for the readerâs convenience
un
,
avoir
; the MS.
has
ie
or
Ie
,
iour
or
Iour
, while the text
gives
je
,
jour
. Again, where an elision is expressed,
the MS. of course combines the two elements into one word, giving

lamour
,
quil
,
qestoit
, while the text separates
them by the apostrophe,
lâamour
,
quâil
,
qâestoit
.
Some other separations have also been made. Thus the MS. often,
but by no means always, combines
plus
with the adjective or
adverb to which it belongs:
plusbass
,
plusauant
; and
often also the word
en
is combined with a succeeding verb, as

enmangeast
,
enserroit
: in these instances the separation
is made in the text, but the MS. reading is recorded. In other cases,
as with the combinations
sique
,
sicomme
,
nounpas
,

envoie
, &c., the usage of the MS. has been followed, though it
is not quite uniform.

The final
-Ã©
(
-Ã©s
) and
-Ã©e
(
-Ã©es
) of nouns
and participles have been marked with the accent for the readerâs
convenience, but in all other cases accents are dispensed with. They
are not therefore used in the terminations
-ez
,
-eez
,
even when standing for
-Ã©s
,
-Ã©es
, as in
festoiez
,

neez
, nor in
asses
,
sachies
, &c., standing for

assez
,
sachiez
(except l. 28712), nor is the grave
accent placed upon the open
e
of
apres
,
jammes
,
&c. Occasionally the diaeresis is used to separate vowels; and the
cedilla is inserted, as in modern French, to indicate the soft sound of

c
where this seems certain, but there are some possibly doubtful
cases, as
sufficance
,
naiscance
, in which it is not
written.

With regard to the use of capital letters, some attempt has been made
to qualify the inconsistency of the MS. In general it may be said that
where capitals are introduced, it has been chiefly in order to indicate
more clearly the cases where qualities or things are personified. It
has not been thought necessary to indicate particularly all these
variations.

The punctuation is the work of the editor throughout; that of the MS.,
where it exists, is of a very uncertain character.

[Pg lxxi]

Contractions, &c., are marked in the printed text by italics, except
in the case of the word
et
, which in the MS. is hardly ever
written in full except at the beginning of a line. In such words as

êest
,
êfit
,
êfaire
, there may be doubt sometimes
between
per
and
par
, and the spelling of some of them
was certainly variable. Attention must be called especially to the
frequently occurring
-oÌ
nÌ

as a termination. It has been regularly
written out as
-oun
, and I  have no doubt that this is right.
In Bozonâs
Contes MoralizÃ©s
the same abbreviation is used,
alternating freely with the full form
-oun
, and it is common
in the MSS. of the
Confessio Amantis
and in the Ellesmere MS.
of the
Canterbury Tales
(so far as I have had the opportunity
of examining it), especially in words of French origin such as

devocioun
,
contricioun
. In the French texts this mode
of writing is applied also very frequently to the monosyllables

mon
,
ton
,
son
,
bon
,
don
,
non
,
as well as to
bontÃ©
,
nonpas
,
noncertein
, &c.
The scribe of the
Mirour
writes
doun
in full once
(24625) with
doÌ
nÌ

in the same stanza, in
Bal.
xxi.
4
noun
is twice fully written, and in some MSS. of the

TraitiÃ©
(e.g. Bodley 294) the full form occurs frequently side
by side with the abbreviation. A similar conclusion must be adopted as
regards
aÌ
nÌ

(annum), also written
aun
,
glaÌ
nÌ

,

daÌ
nÌ
cer
, and the termination
-aÌ
nÌ
ce
, which is
occasionally found.

BALADES.

The existence of the
Cinkante Balades
was first made known to
the public by Warton in his
History of English Poetry
, Sect.
xix, his attention having been drawn to the MS. which contains them by
its possessor, Lord Gower. After describing the other contents of this
MS., he says: âBut the
Cinkante Balades
or fifty French Sonnets
above mentioned are the curious and valuable part of Lord Gowerâs
manuscript. They are not mentioned by those who have written the Life
of this poet or have catalogued his works. Nor do they appear in any
other manuscript of Gower which I have examined. But if they should
be discovered in any other, I will venture to pronounce that a more
authentic, unembarrassed, and practicable copy than this before us will
not be produced.... To say no more, however, of the value which these
little pieces may derive from being so scarce and so little known,
they have much real and intrinsic merit. They are tender, pathetic
and poetical, and place our old poet Gower
[Pg lxxii]
in a more advantageous
point of view than that in which he has hitherto been usually seen. I
know not if any even among the French poets themselves of this period
have left a set of more finished sonnets; for they were probably
written when Gower was a young man, about the year 1350. Nor had yet
any English poet treated the passion of love with equal delicacy of
sentiment and elegance of composition. I will transcribe four of these
balades as correctly and intelligibly as I am able; although, I must
confess, there are some lines which I do not exactly comprehend.â He
then quotes as specimens
Bal.
xxxvi, xxxiv, xliii, and xxx,
but his transcription is far from being correct and is often quite
unintelligible.

Date.
âThe date at which the
Cinkante Balades
were
composed cannot be determined with certainty. Warton, judging
apparently by the style and subject only, decided, as we have seen,
that they belonged to the period of youth, and we know from a passage
in the
Mirour
(27340) that the author composed love poems of
some kind in his early life. Apart from this, however, the evidence is
all in favour of assigning the
Balades
to the later years of
the poetâs life. It is true, of course, that the Dedication to King
Henry IV which precedes them, and the Envoy which closes them, may
have been written later than the rest; but at the same time it must be
noted that the second balade of the Dedication speaks distinctly of
a purpose of making poems for the entertainment of the royal court,
and the mutilated title which follows the Dedication confirms this,
so far as it can be read. Again, the prose remarks which accompany

Bal.
v and vi make it clear that the circumstances of the
poems are not personal to the author, seeing that he there divides
them into two classes, those that are appropriate for persons about
to be married, and those that are âuniversalâ and have application to
all sorts and conditions of lovers. Moreover, several of these last,
viz, xli-xliv and also xlvi, are supposed to be addressed by ladies
to their lovers. It is evident that the balades are only to a very
limited extent, if at all, expressive of the actual feelings of the
author towards a particular person. As an artist he has set himself to
supply suitable forms of expression for the feelings of others, and
in doing so he imagines their variety of circumstances and adapts his
composition accordingly. For this kind of work it is not necessary, or
perhaps even desirable, to be
[Pg lxxiii]
a lover oneself; it is enough to have
been a lover once: and that Gower could in his later life express the
feelings of a lover with grace and truth we have ample evidence in the

Confessio Amantis
. No doubt it is possible that these balades
were written at various times in the poetâs life, and perhaps some
persons, recognizing the greater spontaneity and the more gracefully
poetical character (as it seems to me) of the first thirty or so, as
compared with the more evident tendency to moralize in the rest, may be
inclined to see in this an indication of earlier date for the former
poems. In fact however the moralizing tendency, though always present,
grew less evident in Gowerâs work with advancing years. There is less
of it in the
Confessio Amantis
than in his former works, and
this not by accident but on principle, the author avowing plainly that
unmixed morality had not proved effective, and accepting love as the
one universally interesting subject. When Henry of Lancaster, the man
after his own heart, was fairly seated on the throne, he probably felt
himself yet more free to lay aside the self-imposed task of setting
right the world, and to occupy himself with a purely literary task in
the language and style which he felt to be most suitable for a court.
In any case it seems certain that some at least of the balades were
composed with a view to the court of Henry IV, and the collection
assumed its present shape probably in the year of his accession, 1399,
for we know that either in the first or the second year of Henry IV the
poet became blind and ceased to write.

Form and Versification.
âThe collection consists of a
Dedication addressed to Henry IV, fifty-one (not fifty) balades of love
(one number being doubled by mistake), then one, unnumbered, addressed
to the Virgin, and a general Envoy. The balades are written in
stanzas of seven or eight lines, exactly half of the whole fifty-four
(including the Dedication) belonging to each arrangement. The
seven-line stanza rhymes
ab ab bcc
with Envoy
bc bc
, or
in three instances
ab ab baa
, Envoy
ba ba
; the eight-line
stanza ordinarily
ab ab bc bc
with Envoy
bc bc
, but also
in seven instances
ab ab ba ba
with Envoy
ba ba
. The form
is the normal one of the balade, three stanzas with rhymes alike and
an Envoy; but in one case,
Bal.
ix, there are five stanzas with
Envoy, and in another, xxxii, the Envoy is wanting. Also the balade
addressed to the Virgin, which
[Pg lxxiv]
is added at the end, is without Envoy,
and there follows a general Envoy of seven lines, rhyming independently
and referring to the whole collection.

The balade form is of course taken from Continental models, and
the metre of the verse is syllabically correct like that of the

Mirour
. As was observed however about the octosyllabic line of
the
Mirour
, so it may be said of the ten-syllable verse here,
that the rhythm is not exactly like that of the French verse of the
Continent. The effect is due, as before remarked, to the attempt to
combine the English accentual with the French syllabic measure. This is
especially visible in the treatment of the caesura. In the compositions
of the French writers of the new poetryâFroissart, for exampleâthe
ten- (or eleven-) syllable line has regularly a break after the fourth
syllable. This fourth syllable however may be either accented or not,
that is, either as in the line,

âSe vous voulez aucune plainte faire,â

or as in the following,

âPrenez juge qui soit de noble afaire.â

The weaker form of caesura shown in this latter line occurs
in at least ten per cent. of the verses in this measure which Froissart
gives in the
TrÃ©sor Amoureux
, and the case is much the same with
the
Balades
of Charles dâOrlÃ©ans, a generation later. Gower, on
the other hand, does not admit the unaccented syllable (mute
e

termination) in the fourth place at all; no such line as this,

âDe ma dame que jâaime et ameray,â

is to be found in his balades. Indeed, we may go further
than this, and say that the weak syllable is seldom tolerated in the
other even places of the verse, where the English ear demanded a
strongly marked accentual beat. Such a line as

âVous me poetz sicom vostre demeineâ (
Bal.
xxxix. 2)

is quite exceptional.

At the same time he does not insist on ending a word on the fourth
syllable, but in seven or eight per cent. of his lines the word is run
on into the next foot, as

âEt vous, ma dame, croietz bien cela.â

This is usually the form that the verse takes in such
cases, the
[Pg lxxv]
syllable carried on being a mute
e
termination, and
the caesura coming after this syllable; but lines like the following
also occur, in which the caesura is transfered to the end of the third
foot:

âSi fuisse en paradis, ceo beal manoir,â v. 3.

âEn toute humilitÃ© sans mesprisure,â xii. 4.

So xvi. l. 2, xx. l. 20, &c., and others again in which the
syllable carried on is an accented one, as

âSi femme porroit estre celestine,â xxi. 2.

âJeo ne sai nomer autre, si le noun;â xxiv. 1.

It must be noticed also that the poet occasionally uses the
so-called epic caesura, admitting a superfluous unaccented syllable
after the second foot, as

âEt pensetz, dame, de ceo qâai dit pieÃ§a,â ii. 3.

âQe mieulx voldroie morir en son servage,â xxiii. 2.

So with
dame
,
dames
, xix. l. 20, xx. l.
13, xxxvii. l. 18, xlvi. l. 15
[K]
; and with other words, xxv. l.
8, &c.,
aime
, xxxiii. l. 10,
nouche
, xxxviii. l. 23,

grace
, xliv. l. 8,
fame
. In xx. 1 the same thing occurs
exceptionally in another part of the line, the word
roe
counting
as one syllable only, though it is a dissyllable in
Mir.
10942.
Naturally the termination
-Ã©e
, as in iii. 2,

âLa renomÃ©e, dont jâai lâoreile pleine,â

does not constitute an epic caesura, because, as observed
elsewhere, the final
e
in this case did not count as a syllable
in Anglo-Norman verse.

On the whole we may say that Gower treats the caesura with much the
same freedom as is used in the English verse of the period, and at the
same time he marks the beat of his iambic verse more strongly than was
done by the contemporary French poets.

Matter and Style.
âAs regards the literary character of these
compositions it must be allowed that they have, as Warton says, âmuch
real and intrinsic merit.â There is indeed a grace and poetical feeling
in some of them which makes them probably the best things of the kind
that have been produced by English writers of French, and as good as
anything of the kind which had up to that time been written in English.
The author himself has
[Pg lxxvi]
marked them off into two unequal divisions.
The poems of the first class (i-v) express for us the security of the
accepted lover, whose suit is to end in lawful marriage:

âJeo sui tout soen et elle est toute moie,

Jeo lâai et elle auci me voet avoir;

Pour tout le mond jeo ne la changeroie.â (
Bal.
v.)

From these he passes to those expressions of feeling which apply
to lovers generally, âqui sont diversement travailez en la fortune
dâamour.â Nothing can be more graceful in its way than the idea and
expression of
Bal.
viii, âDâestable coer, qui nullement se mue,â
where the poetâs thought is represented as a falcon, flying on the
wings of longing and desire in a moment across the sea to his absent
mistress, and taking his place with her till he shall see her again.
Once more, in
Bal.
xv, the image of the falcon appears, but
this time it is a bird which is allowed to fly only with a leash, for
so bound is the lover to his lady that he cannot but return to her
from every flight. At another time (
Bal.
xviii) the lover is in
despair at the hardness of his ladyâs heart: drops of water falling
will in time wear through the hardest stone; but this example will not
serve him, for he cannot pierce the tender ears of his mistress with
prayers, how urgent and repeated soever; God and the saints will hear
his prayers, but she is harder than the marble of the quarryâthe more
he entreats, the less she listens, âCom plus la prie, et meinz mâad
entendu.â Again (xiii) his state is like the month of March, now shine,
now shower. When he looks on the sweet face of his lady and sees her
âgentilesse,â wisdom, and bearing, he has only pure delight; but when
he perceives how far above him is her worth, fear and despair cloud
over his joy, as the moon is darkened by eclipse. But in any case he
must think of her (xxiv); she has so written her name on his heart that
when he hears the chaplain read his litany he can think of nothing but
of her. God grant that his prayer may not be in vain! Did not Pygmalion
in time past by prayer obtain that his lady should be changed from
stone to flesh and blood, and ought not other lovers to hope for the
same fortune from prayer? He seems to himself to be in a dream, and he
questions with himself and knows not whether he is a human creature or
no, so absorbed is his being by his love. God grant that his prayer
[Pg lxxvii]

may not be in vain! He removes himself from her for a time (xxv)
because of evil speakers, who with their slanders might injure her good
name; but she must know that his heart is ever with her and that all
his grief and joy hangs upon her, âCar qui bien aime ses amours tard
oblie.â But (xxix) she has misunderstood his absence; report tells him
that she is angry with him. If she knew his thoughts, she would not be
so disposed towards him; this balade he sends to make his peace, for he
cannot bear to be out of her love. In another (xxxii) he expresses the
deepest dejection: the New Year has come and is proceeding from winter
towards spring, but for him there is winter only, which shrouds him
in the thickest gloom. His ladyâs beauty ever increases, but there is
no sign of that kindness which should go with it; love only tortures
him and gives him no friendly greeting. To this balade there is no
Envoy, whether it be by negligence of the copyist, or because the lover
could not even summon up spirit to direct it to his mistress. Again
(xxxiii), he has given her his all, body and soul, both without recall,
as a gift for this New Year of which he has just now spoken: his sole
delight is to serve her. Will she not reward him even by a look? He
asks for no present from her, let him only have some sign which may bid
him hope, âSi plus nây soit, donetz le regarder.â The coming of Saint
Valentine encourages him somewhat (xxxiv) with the reflection that all
nature yields to love, but (xxxv) he remembers with new depression that
though birds may choose their mates, yet he remains alone. May comes on
(xxxvii), and his lady should turn her thoughts to love, but she sports
with flowers and pays no heed to the prayer of her prisoner. She is
free, but he is strongly bound; her close is full of flowers, but he
cannot enter it; in the sweet season his fortune is bitter, May is for
him turned into winter: âVous estes franche et jeo sui fort liÃ©.â

Then the lady has her say, and in accordance with the prerogative of
her sex her moods vary with startling abruptness. She has doubts (xli)
about her loverâs promises. He who swears most loudly is the most
likely to deceive, and some there are who will make love to a hundred
and swear to each that she is the only one he loves. âTo thee, who art
one thing in the morning and at evening another, I send this balade
for thy reproof, to let thee know that I leave thee and care not for
thee.â In xliii she is fully convinced of his treachery, he is falser
than Jason to Medea or
[Pg lxxviii]
Eneas to Dido. How different from Lancelot and
Tristram and the other good knights! âCâest ma dolour que fuist ainÃ§ois
ma joie.â With this is contrasted the sentiment of xliv, in which the
lady addresses one whom she regards as the flower of chivalry and the
ideal of a lover, and to whom she surrenders unconditionally. The lady
speaks again in xlvi, and then the series is carried to its conclusion
with rather a markedly moral tone. At the end comes an address to
the Virgin, in which the author declares himself bound to serve all
ladies, but her above them all. No lover can really be without a loving
mistress, for in her is love eternal and invariable. He loves and
serves her with all his heart, and he trusts to have his reward. The
whole concludes with an Envoy addressed to âgentle England,â describing
the book generally as a memorial of the joy which has come to the
poetâs country from its noble king Henry, sent by heaven to redress its
ills.

Printed Editions.
âThe
Balades
have been twice printed.
They were published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818, together with the
other contents of the Trentham MS. except the English poem, with
the title âBalades and other Poems by John Gower. Printed from the
original MS. in the library of the Marquis of Stafford at Trentham,â
Roxburghe Club, 1818, 4to. The editor was Earl Gower. This edition has
a considerable number of small errors, several of which obscure the
sense; only a small number of copies was printed, and the book can
hardly be obtained.

In 1886 an edition of the
Balades
and of the
TraitiÃ©

was published in Germany under the name of Dr. Edmund Stengel in the
series of âAusgaben und Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete der romanischen
Philologie.â The title of this book is âJohn Gowerâs Minnesang
und EhezuchtbÃ¼chlein: LXXII anglonormannische Balladen ... neu
herausgegeben von Edmund Stengel.â Marburg, 1886. The preface is signed
with the initials D. H. The editor of this convenient little book was
unable to obtain access to the original MS., apparently because he had
been wrongly informed as to the place where it was to be found, and
accordingly printed the
Balades
from the Roxburghe edition with
such emendations as his scholarship suggested. He removed a good many
obvious errors of a trifling kind, and in a few cases he was successful
in emending the text by conjecture. Some important corrections,
however, still remained to be made,
[Pg lxxix]
and in several instances he
introduced error into the text either by incorrectly transcribing the
Roxburghe edition or by unsuccessful attempts at emendation. I do not
wish to speak with disrespect of this edition. The editor laboured
under serious disadvantages in not being able to refer to the original
MS. and in not having always available even a copy of the Roxburghe
edition, so that we cannot be surprised that he should have made
mistakes. I have found his text useful to work upon in collation, and
some of his critical remarks are helpful.

The present Text.
âThe text of this edition is based directly
on the MS., which remains still in the library at Trentham Hall and to
which access was kindly allowed me by the Duke of Sutherland. I propose
to describe the MS. fully, since it is of considerable interest, and
being in a private library it is not generally accessible.

The Trentham MS., referred to as T., is a thin volume, containing 41
leaves of parchment, measuring about 6Â¼ in. x 9Â¼ in., and made up
apparently as follows: a
4
, b
1
, c
6
, dâf
8
(one leaf cut out), g
1
,
h
4
, i
2
(no catchwords).

The first four leaves and the last two are blank except for notes of
ownership, &c., so that the text of the book extends only from f. 5 to
f. 39, one leaf being lost between f. 33 and f. 34.

The pages are ruled for 35 lines and are written in single column.
The handwriting is of the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the
fifteenth century, and resembles what I elsewhere describe as the
âthird handâ in MS. Fairfax 3, though I should hesitate to affirm that
it is certainly the same, not having had the opportunity of setting the
texts side by side. There is, however, another hand in the MS., which
appears in the Latin lines on ff. 33 v
o
and 39 v
o
.

The initial letters of poems and stanzas are coloured, but there is no
other ornamentation.

The book contains (1) ff. 5â10 v
o
, the English poem in seven-line
stanzas addressed to Henry IV, beginning âO worthi noble kyng.â

(2) f. 10 v
o
, 11, the Latin piece beginning âRex celi deus.â

(3) f. 11 v
o
â12 v
o
, two French balades with a set of Latin verses
between them, addressed to Henry IV (f. 12 is seriously damaged). This
is what I refer to as the Dedication.

[Pg lxxx]

(4) ff. 12 v
o
â33,
Cinkante balades
.

(5) f. 33 v
o
, Latin lines beginning âEcce patet tensus,â incomplete
owing to the loss of the next leaf. Written in a different hand.

(6) ff. 34â39, âTraitiÃ© pour ensampler les amantz marietz,â imperfect
at the beginning owing to the loss of the preceding leaf.

(7) f. 39 v
o
, Latin lines beginning âHenrici quarti,â written in the
hand which appears on f. 33 v
o
.

On the first blank leaf is the following in the handwriting of Sir
Thomas Fairfax:

âS
r
. John Gowerâs learned Poems the same booke by himself
presented to kinge Henry ye fourth before his Coronation.â

(Originally this was âatt his Coronation,â then âatt or
before his Coronation,â and finally the words âatt orâ were struck
through with the pen.)

Then lower down in the same hand:

âFor my honorable freind & kinsman s
r
. Thomas Gower knt. and
Baronett from

Ffairfax 1656.â

On the verso of the second leaf near the left-hand top corner is
written a name which appears to be âRychemond,â and there is added in a
different hand of the sixteenth century:

âLiber Hen: Septimi tunc comitis Richmond manu propria script.â

On the fifth leaf, where the text of the book begins, in the right-hand
top corner, written in the hand of Fairfax:

âffairfax N
o
265

by the gift of the learned Gentleman Charles Gedde Esq. liuinge
in the Citty of St Andrews.â

Then below in another hand:

âLibenter tunc dabam

Id testor Carolus Gedde

Ipsis bis septenis Kalendis

mensis Octobris 1656.â

On the last leaf of the text, f. 39, there is a note in Latin made in
1651 at St. Andrews (Andreapoli) by C. Gedde at the age of seventy,
with reference to the date of Henry IVâs reign. Then in English,

âThis booke pertaineth to aged Charles Gedde,â

and inserted between the lines by Fairfax,

âbut now to ffairfax of his gift, Jun. 28. 1656.â

[Pg lxxxi]

Below follows a note in English on the date of the death of
Chaucer and of Gower, and their places of burial.

The first of the blank leaves at the end is covered with Latin anagrams
on the names âCarolus Geddeius,â âCarolus Geddie,â or âCarolus Geddee,â
with this heading,

âIn nomen venerandi et annosi Amici sui Caroli Geddei
Anagrammata,â

and ends with the couplet:

âSerpit amor JonathÃ¦ (Prisciano labe) Chirurgo

MephiboshÃ¦ pedibus tam manibus genibus,â

which is not very intelligible, but is perhaps meant to
indicate the name of the composer of the anagrams.

In the right-hand top corner of the next leaf there is written in what
might be a fifteenth-century hand, âWill Sanders vn Justâ (the rest cut
away).

As to the statement made by Fairfax that this book, meaning apparently
this very copy, was presented by the author to Henry IV, it is hardly
likely that he had any trustworthy authority for it. The book must
evidently have been arranged for some such purpose; on the whole
however it is more likely that this was not the actual presentation
copy, but another written about the same time and left in the hands of
the author. The copy intended for presentation to the king, if such a
copy there were, would probably have been more elaborately ornamented;
and moreover the Latin lines on the last leaf, âHenrici quartiâ &c.,
bear the appearance of having been added later. The poet there speaks
of himself as having become blind âin the first year of king Henry IV,â
and of having entirely ceased to write in consequence; and in another
version of the same lines, which is found in the Glasgow MS. of the

Vox Clamantis
, he dates his blindness from the
second

year of King Henryâs reign. In any case it seems clear that his
blindness did not come on immediately after Henryâs accession; for
the
Cronica Tripertita
, a work of considerable length, must
have been written after the death of Richard II, which took place
some five months after the accession of Henry IV. It would be quite
in accordance with Gowerâs usual practice to keep a copy of the book
by him and add to it or alter it from time to time; the Fairfax MS.
of the
Confessio Amantis
and the All Souls copy of the
Vox
Clamantis
are examples of this mode of proceeding: and I should
[Pg lxxxii]

be rather disposed to think that this volume remained in the authorâs
hands than that it was presented to the king. As to its subsequent
history, if we are to regard the signature âRychemondâ on the second
leaf as a genuine autograph of Henry VII while Earl of Richmond, it
would seem that the book passed at some time into royal hands, but it
can hardly have come to the Earl of Richmond by any succession from
Henry IV. After this we know nothing definite until we find it in the
hands of the âaged Charles Geddeâ of St. Andrews, by whom it was given,
as we have seen, to Fairfax in 1656, and by Fairfax in the same year to
his friend and kinsman Sir Thomas Gower, no doubt on the supposition
that he belonged to the family of the poet. He must have been one of
the Gowers of Stittenham, and from him it has passed by descent to its
present possessor.

The text given by the MS. seems to be on the whole a very correct one.
For the
Cinkante Balades
it is the only manuscript authority,
but as regards the
TraitiÃ©
it may be compared with several other
copies contemporary with the author, and it seems to give as good a
text as any. There seems no reason to doubt that it was written in
the lifetime of the author, who may however have been unable owing
to his failing eyesight to correct it himself. It was nevertheless
carefully revised after being written, as is shown by various
erasures and corrections both in the French and the English portions.
This correctorâs hand is apparently different from both the other
hands which appear in the manuscript. The best proof however of the
trustworthiness of the text is the fact that hardly any emendations are
required either by the metre or the sense. The difficulties presented
by the text of the Roxburghe edition vanish for the most part on
collation of the MS., and the number of corrections actually made in
this edition is very trifling.

In a few points of spelling this MS. differs from that of the

Mirour
: for example,
jeo
(
ieo
) is almost always
used in the
Balades
for
je
(but
ie
in
Ded.

i. 4), and the
-ai
termination is preferred to
-ay
,
though both occur; similarly
sui
,
joie
,
li
,

poi
, where the
Mirour
has more usually
suy
,

joye
,
ly
,
poy
, &c.

What has been said with reference to the
Mirour
about the use
of
u
and
v
,
i
and
j
, applies also here
(except that the scribe of this MS. prefers
i
initially to

I
and sometimes writes
u
initially), and also in general
what is said about division of words,
[Pg lxxxiii]
accents and contractions.
The latter however in the present text of the
Balades
and

TraitiÃ©
are not indicated by italics. It should be noted that

que
in the text stands for a contracted form. The word is

qe
in the
Balades
, when it is fully written out, but

quil
,
tanquil
, &c., are used in the MS.,
qÌ
om
must
evidently be meant for
quom
, and we find
que
frequently
in the
Mirour
. Such forms as
auerai
,
deuera
,

liuere
, &c., usually have
er
abbreviated, but we also
find
saueroit
(viii. 2),
auera
(xvi. 3),
aueray

(xvii. 1), written out fully. Where the termination
-ance
has a
line drawn over it, as in
sufficaÌ
nÌ
ce
,
fiaÌ
nÌ
ce
(iv. 2),
it has been printed
-aunce
, and so
chaÌ
nÌ
con
(xl. 3); but

aun
is written out fully. In general it must be assumed that

-oun
ending a word represents
oÌ
nÌ

, but in xxi. 4 we have

noun
written out fully in both cases.

In the matter of capitals the usage of the MS. is followed for the most
part. The punctuation is of course that of the editor, and it may be
observed that the previous editions have none.

TRAITIÃ.

This work, which is called by its author âun traitiÃ© selonc les
auctours pour essampler les amantz marietz,â is a series of eighteen
balades, each composed of three seven-line stanzas without envoy,
except in the case of the last, which has an additional stanza
addressed âAl universitÃ© de tout le monde,â apologizing for the poetâs
French and serving as a general envoy for the whole collection,
though formally belonging to the last balade. The stanzas rhyme

ab ab bcc
, a form which is used frequently in the
Cinkante
Balades
, as also in Gowerâs English poem addressed to Henry IV
and in the stanzas which are introduced into the eighth book of the

Confessio Amantis
. There are Latin marginal notes summarizing
the contents of each balade, and the whole is concluded by some lines
of Latin. As to the date, if we are to regard the Latin lines âLex
docet auctorumâ as a part of the work (and they are connected with
it in all the copies), we have a tolerably clear indication in the
concluding couplet:

âHinc vetus annorum Gower sub spe meritorum

Ordine sponsorum tutus adhibo thorum.â

This was written evidently just before the authorâs marriage, which
took place, as we know, near the beginning of the year 1398 (by the
modern reckoning), and therefore it would seem
[Pg lxxxiv]
that the
TraitiÃ©

belongs to the year 1397. It is true that one MS. (Bodley 294) omits
this concluding couplet, but in view of the fact that it is contained
not only in all the other copies, but also in the Trin. Coll. Camb.
MS., which seems to be derived from the same origin as Bodl. 294, we
cannot attach much importance to the omission.

In several MSS. the
TraitiÃ©
is found attached to the

Confessio Amantis
, and with a heading to the effect that the
author, having shown above in English the folly of those who love
âpar amour,â will now write in French for the world generally a book
to instruct married lovers by example to keep the faith of their
espousals. But though appearing thus as a pendant to the English work
in the Fairfax, Harleian, Bodley, Trin. Coll. Camb., Wadham, Keswick
Hall and Wollaton MSS., it does not necessarily belong to it. It is
absent in the great majority of copies of the
Confessio Amantis
,
and in the Fairfax MS. it appears in a different hand from that of the
English poem and was certainly added later. Moreover the
TraitiÃ©

is found by itself in the Trentham book, and following the
Vox
Clamantis
in the All Souls and Glasgow MSS., in both these cases
having been added later than the text of that work and in a different
hand. We cannot tell what heading it had in the Trentham or the All
Souls MSS., but probably the same as that of the Glasgow copy, which
makes no reference to any other work. âThis is a treatise which John
Gower has made in accordance with the authors, touching the estate of
matrimony, whereby married lovers may instruct themselves by example
to hold the faith of their holy espousals.â This variation of the
heading is certainly due to the author, and we are entitled to regard
the
TraitiÃ©
as in some sense an independent work, occasionally
attached by the author to the
Confessio Amantis
, but also
published separately.

As to the versification, the remarks already made upon that of the

Balades
apply also to these poems.

The subject of the work is defined by the title: it is intended to
set forth by argument and example the nature and dignity of the state
of marriage and the evils springing from adultery and incontinence.
The tendency to moralize is naturally much stronger in these poems
than in the
Cinkante Balades
, and they are consequently less
poetical. The most pleasing is perhaps xv, âComunes sont la cronique et
lâistoireâ: âStill is the folly of Lancelot and of Tristram remembered,
that others by it may
[Pg lxxxv]
take warning. All the year round the fair of
love is kept, where Cupid sells or gives away hearts: he makes men
drink of one or the other of his two tuns, the one sweet and the other
bitter. Thus the fortune of love is unstable: the lover is now in joy
and now in torment, but the wise will be warned by others, as a bird
avoids the trap in which he sees another caught, and they will not
take delight in wanton love.â Many of the examples are from stories
already told in the
Confessio Amantis
, as those of Nectanabus,
Hercules and Deianira, Jason, Clytemnestra, Lucretia, Paulina, Alboin
and Rosamond, Tereus, Valentinian.

Text.
âOf the
TraitiÃ©
there exist several contemporary
copies besides that of the Trentham MS. It is found appended to the

Confessio Amantis
in MS. Fairfax 3, with a heading which closely
connects it with that poem; it occurs among the various Latin pieces
which follow the
Vox Clamantis
in All Souls MS. 98, and again in
much the same kind of position in the MS. of the
Vox Clamantis

belonging to the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow. The first two of these
copies are, I have no doubt, in the same handwriting, that which I call
the âsecond handâ of MS. Fairfax 3, and I am of opinion that the third
(that of the Glasgow MS.) is so also. This question of the handwritings
found in contemporary copies of Gower will be discussed later, when the
MSS. in question are more fully described: suffice it to say at present
that these copies are all good, and they agree very closely both with
one another and with that of the Trentham book, while at the same
time they are independent of one another. They have all been collated
throughout for this edition. Besides these original copies there is one
in Harleian MS. 3869, which appears to be taken from Fairfax 3, and
also in the following MSS., in all of which the
TraitiÃ©
follows
the
Confessio Amantis
: Bodley 294, Trinity College, Cambridge,
R. 3. 2, Wadham Coll. 13, and the Keswick Hall and Wollaton MSS. Of
these Bodley 294 has been collated for this edition, and the rest
occasionally referred to.

The MSS. may be tabulated as follows, further description being
reserved for the occasions when they are more fully used:â

F.â
Fairfax
3, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, containing the

Confessio Amantis
, the
TraitiÃ© pour essampler
, ff. 186
v
o
-190, and several Latin poems.

S.â
All Souls College, Oxford
, 98, containing the
Vox
[Pg lxxxvi]

Clamantis
,
Cronica Tripertita
, a miscellaneous collection of
Latin poems, and the
TraitiÃ©
, ff. 132-135.

T.âThe
Trentham
MS., described above.

G.â
Hunterian Museum, Glasgow
, T. 2. 17, with nearly the same
contents as S. The
TraitiÃ©
is ff. 124 v
o
-128.

H.â
Harleian
3869, in the British Museum, agreeing with F.

B.â
Bodley
294, in the Bodleian Library, containing the

Confessio Amantis
, the
TraitiÃ©
, and a few Latin pieces.

Tr.â
Trinity Coll. Camb.
R. 3. 2, with nearly the same
contents as B.

W.â
Wadham Coll. Oxf.
13,
Confessio Amantis
and

TraitiÃ©
, the latter imperfect at the end.

K.âIn the library of J. H. Gurney, Esq., Keswick Hall, Norwich, with
the same contents as F.

A.âLord Middletonâs MS., at Wollaton Hall.

The
TraitiÃ©
has been twice printed: first by the Roxburghe
Club from the Trentham MS.
[L]
, and then by Dr. Stengel, in both cases
with the
Cinkante Balades
. The German editor unfortunately
took as the basis of his text the copy in B, which is much inferior
in correctness to those of several other MSS. which were within
his reach
[M]
. He has also in many cases failed to give a correct
representation of the MS. which he follows, and his collation of other
copies is incomplete.

The text of the present edition is based upon that of F, which is at
least as good as any of the three other copies which I have called
contemporary, and has the advantage over two of them that it is
perfect, whereas they have each lost a leaf. These four are so nearly
on the same level of correctness that it matters little
[Pg lxxxvii]
on other
grounds which of them we follow. A full collation is here given of T,
S and G, and the readings of B are occasionally mentioned. H and K
are probably dependent on F. Tr. is a moderately good copy, closely
connected with B, but in view of the excellence of the other materials
it is not worth collating; A is a manuscript of the same class, but
rather less correct. Finally the text of W, which is late and full of
blunders, may be set down as worthless.

Et sa compaigne au droit divis

Le fist avoir du dame Evein.

Pour le pecchÃ©, pour le forsfait,

Dont Lucifer avoit mesfait,

Dieus, qâen vist la desconvenue,
3

Coment son ciel estoit desfait,â

Pour ce tantost Adam fuist fait

Et Eve auci tout nu a nue
90

En p

adis dessoutz la nue:

Siqâ en apres de celle issue

Que de leur corps serroit estrait,

Soit restorÃ© qâestoit perdue

Amont le ciel, a la value

Que Lucifer avoit sustrait.

Du noble main no duy parent

Estoiont fait molt noblement,

Car dieu le piere les forma:

Pour noble cause et ensement
100

Estoiont fait, quant tielement

A son ciel dieu les ordina:

En noble lieu dieu les crea

Et paradis tout leur bailla,

Que molt fuist noble au tiele gent;

Mais lâen puet dire bien cela,

Helas! quant le pecchÃ© de la

Les anientist si vilement.

Chacun de vous ad bien oÃ¯

Coment Adam se departi
110

De Paradis, mais nepourquant,

Solonc que truis en genesi

Vous en dirray trestout ensi:
4

Dont falt savoir primer avant

Qâen Paradis avoit estant

Une arbre dieu luy toutpuissant,

Dont il les pommes deffendi

A Adam, quâil nâen fuist mangant,
5

Et dist, sâil en mangast, par tant
6

Du mort en serroit anienti.
7

120

Bien tost apres, ce truis escrit,

Cil Lucifer dont vous ay dit

SâaparÃ§ut de la covenance;

Et ot dâAdam trop grant despit,

Quâil fuist a celle joye eslit,

Dont mesmes par sa mescheance

Estoit cheeuz: lors sa semblance

Mua, siq
ue
par resemblance

En forme dâun serpent sâassit

Dessur celle arbre, et dâaquointance
130

Pria dame Eve, a qui constance

De sa nature ert entredit.

Au frele et fieble femeline

En la figure serpentine,

Dessur celle arbre u quâil seoit,

Ly deable conta sa covine:

Si dist, âHe, fem
m
e, pren sesine

Du fruit qui tant p
er
est benoit:

Car lors serras en ton endroit
[Pg 5]

Du bien et mal, du tort et droit,
140

Sachant come dieu.â O la falsine!

Par ce qâensi la p
ro
mettoit,

La fem
m
e son voloir tornoit

Contre la volentÃ© divine.

La fem
m
e, qui par tricherie

Fuist du serpent ensi trahie,

Mangut le pom
m
e, helas, mortal:

Et quant ot fait la felonie,

Tantost sâen vait come fole amie

Pour tempter son especial;
150

Et tant luy dist que parigal

Le fist de cel origenal;

Le fruit mangut par compaignie.

Ensi ly serpent fuist causal

Au fem
m
e, et fem
m
e auci du mal

Causoit que lâom
m
e fist folie.

Au mors du pom
m
e tant amer

Mort et pecchÃ© tout au primer

Dedeinz Adam pristront demure:

Car il ne savoit excuser
160

Sa conscience, ainz accuser

De la mortiele forsfaiture.

Helas! cil qui tant fuist dessure

Fuist tant dessoutz en si poy dâure;

Car dieux luy fist nud despoiler:

Come sa malvoise creature,

Atteinte ovesq
ue
la menure

Le fist come traitre forsjuger.

Câestoit du dieu le Jugement,

QâAdam serroit vilaynement
170

Botuz du Paradis en terre;

U qâen dolour molt tristement

Sa viande et son vestement

Irroit a pourchacer et querre:

Sa fem
m
e auci pour son contrere,

De ce qâa dieu ne voloit plere,

Tous jours a son enfantement,

Quant vient au naturel affere,

Doit tous ses fils et files trere

En plour et en ghemissement.
180

Mais tout ce nâeust estÃ© que jeeu,

Si plus du paine nâeust Ã«eu;

Mais sur trestout câestoit le pis

La mort, dont au darrein perdu

Furont loigns en enfern de dieu

Et piere et miere et file et fils,

Sanz fin pour demourer toutdis.

f. 6

Lors pourray dire a mon avis,

Du pecchÃ© vient en chacun lieu

Ce dont ly bon sont anientiz,
190

Car ciel et terre et paradis

De sa malice ad corrumpu.

Pour ce vous dirray la maniere

Com
m
ent PecchÃ© nasquit primere,

Et de ses files tout ades;

Si vous dirray qui fuist son piere,

Et u nasquist celle adv

Trestout dirray cy en apres.

Ly deable mesme a son decess,

Quant il p
er
dist sanz nul reless
200

Du ciel la belle meson cliere,

Lors engendra tieu fals encress,

Come vous orretz, si faitez pes;

Car je vuill conter la matiere.

Com
m
ent PecchÃ© nasquist du deble, et com
m
ent
Mort nasquist du PecchÃ©, et coment Mort espousa sa miere et
engendra sur luy les sept vices mortieux.

Ly deable, qui tous mals soubtile

Et trestous biens hiet et revile,

De sa malice concevoit

Et puis enfantoit une file,

Qâert tresmalvoise, laide et vile,

La quelle PecchÃ© no
u
n avoit.
210

Il mesmes sa norrice estoit,

Et la gardoit et doctrinoit

De sa plus tricherouse guile;
9

Par quoy la file en son endroit

Si violente devenoit,

Que riens ne touche q
ue
nâavile.

Tant p
er
servoit le deble a grÃ©
10

Sa jofne file en son degrÃ©

Et tant luy fist plesant desport,

Dont il fuist tant enamourÃ©,
220

Que sur sa file ad engendrÃ©

Un fils, que lâen appella Mort.
[Pg 6]

Lors ot le deable grant confort,

Car tout quidoit par leur enhort

De lâome avoir sa volentÃ©;

Car quant ils deux sont dâun acort,

Tout quanq
ue
vient a leur resort

Le deble tient enheritÃ©.

Au piere furont molt cheris

PecchÃ© sa file et Mort son fils,
230

Car trop luy furont resemblant:

Et pour cela par son devis,

Pour plus avoir de ses norris,

La miere espousa son enfant:

Si vont sept files engendrant,

Qui sont dâenfern enheritant

Et ont le mond tout entrepris;

Come je vous serray devisant,

Des queux no
u

Et du mestier dont sont apris.
240

Les no

Lâun apres lâautre en leur degrÃ©

Dirray, des quelles la primere

Orguil ad no

La tresmalvoise malurÃ©,

Que plus resemble a son fals piere;

Lâautre est Envye, que sa chiere

Belle ad devant, et parderere

Plaine est du male volentÃ©;

Ire est la tierce, et trop est fiere,
250

Que jam
m
ais nâot sa pes plenere,

Ainz fait trestoute adversitÃ©:

La quarte est celle dâAvarice,

Que lâor plus q
ue
son dieu cherice;
11

La quinte Accide demy morte,

Qâau dieu nâau monde fait service;

La siste file en son office

Câest Glotonie, que la porte

Des vices gart, et tout apporte

Ce dont la frele char supporte;
260

Du foldelit câest la norrice:

Mais la septime se desporte,

Câest Leccherie, que se porte

Sur toutes autres la plus nice.

Ensi com
m
e je le vous ay dit,

PecchÃ© du deable qâest maldit

Primerement prist sa nescance,

Et puis du PecchÃ© Mort nasquit,

Dont plus avant com

12

Par si tresmalvoise alliance
270

Nasquiront plain du malfesance

Ly autre sept, que dâattendance

Au deble sont par tout soubgit;

Dont cil qui tous les mals avance,

Quant naistre vit ytiele enfance,

De sa part grantment sâesjoÃ¯t.

Com

Au Siecle tous les envoia:

280

Ses p

Parmy le Siecle convoia;

Et tant y fist et engina

Que ly fals Siecle sâenclina

De faire tout par leur menage,

Par ceaux sa gloire devisa,

Par ceaux toutdis se conseila,

Par ceaux fist maint horrible oultrage.

Chascune solonc son endroit

Office seculiere avoit
290

Le Siecle pour plus enginer:

Orguil sa gloire maintenoit,

Envie ades luy consailloit,

Et dâIre fist son guerroier,

Et dâAvarice tresorer,

Accidie estoit son chamberer,

Et Glotonie de son droit

Estoit son maistre boteller,

Et Leccherie en son mestier

Sur tous sa chiere amie estoit.
300

Cil qui trestous ceos mals engendre,

Quant vist les files de son gendre

Mener le Siecle a leur voloir,

Lors comenÃ§a consail a prendre

Coment cel hom

Pour faire en son enfern descendre.

En la deserte salvagine,

Dâun autre mal lors sâest pourveu,

Oietz quâil fist de sa covine.

Au Siecle mesmes sâen ala,

Et tout son consail luy conta,

Et pria quâil luy volt aider:

Tant luy promist, tant luy dona,

Que lâun a lâautre sâacorda,

Et le firont entrejurer;
330

Mais pour son purpos achever

Com

Tous ses amys, et pour cela

Un parlement faisoit crier,

Par queux se pourroit consailler

Com

Les bries tantost furont escris

A ceaux qui furont ses amys,

Que tous vienent au parlement,

PecchÃ© la dame du paiis

Ove ses sept files noblement

Vint primer a lâassemblement;

Le Siecle y vient ensemblement

Ove belle route a son devis;

Mais Mort venoit darreinement:

Et lors quant tous furont present,

Le deable disoit son avis.

Devant trestous en audience

Et si leur dist parole fiere:

âPar ceste cause je vous pri,

Le Siecle auci de sa partie

De ce que chacun luy promist,

Et pria que chascun luy dist

Du Mort, que lâautre tricheour

Ont fait muscer de leur falsine.

Reson, qâa lâalme est necessaire,

Au Char de lâomme lors repaire,

Et Paour luy suioit apres:

Mais dâautrepart fuist au contraire

Temptacio

Qâau Char tempter ne falt jam

Lâun volt entrer par bon

Mais lâautre se tenoit si pres
680

Au Char tempter du tiel affaire,

Par quoy la Char sanz nul decess

A tieu delit se tient ades,

Que Reson ne lâen pot retraire.

Reso

Et tant come pot la conseila

Du bon

Que sa folie lessera:

Et ce luy dist, qâau fin morra

En grande tribulacio

690

Mais dâautrepart Temptacio

Au Char fist sa collacio

Et tieux delices luy moustra,

Du pecchÃ© delectacio

Et seculiere elacio

Par quoy la Char desreson

Et quant Paour ce vist, coment

La Char par si fals temptement

Sâestoit du Reso

Lors dist au Char tresfierement:
700

âHe, Char tresfole et necligent,

He, Char mortiele, he, Char porrie,

Trop es deÃ§u du deablerie,

Qâau toi muscont par tricherie

La Mort que vient sodainement.

Mais vien devers ma compaignie,

Si te moustray lâerbergerie

U lâont muscÃ© secretement.â

Paour qâestoit espirital

Lors prist la Char sup

710

Si lâamena droit par la main

Serchant amont et puis aval

Trestous les chambres de lâostal,

Tanquâils troveront au darrein

U Mort lâorrible capitein,

Covert dâun mantelet mondein,

Deinz une chambre cordial

Sâestoit muscÃ© trestout soulein,

En aguaitant la Char humein,
22

Quelle est sa proie natural.
720

Mais quant la Char vist la figure

De celle horrible creature,

Dedeinz soy comenÃ§a trembler,

Et tant se dolt en sa nature

Que tout tenoit a mesprisure

Ce dont se soloit deliter.

Vers PecchÃ© nâosa plus garder,

Ne vers le Siecle au covoiter,

Ainz sâavisa du Mort tout hure:

Si volt vers Reso

730

Sa conscience dâamender

Et servir lâAlme en vie pure.

Paour ensi la Char rebroie,

Qâau Conscience la renvoie,

Et Conscience plus avant

Au bon

Et puis Reso

A lâAlme la fait acordant.

Dont lâAlme, qâot estÃ© devant

Du Char folie languissant,
740

Reprist sâespiritale joye,

Et vait la Char si chastiant

Par quoy la Char molt repentant

Sâen part du deble et sa menoie.

La Char du deble sâen parti

Et du PecchÃ© tout autrecy,

Ne point el Siecle se fia:

Paour lâavoit tant esbahy,

Qâa lâalme tout se converti

f. 9

Sicome Reso

Mais quant ly deble vist cela,
751

Com

Siq

de lâom

Ove PecchÃ© lors se conseilla,

Et puis au Siecle compleigna

Par grant tristour disant ensi:

Dont leur consail demanderay;

Et solonc que je troveray,

Et ove ses files lors conspire

Come porront faire en leur degrÃ©

Que lâom

Au deble qui tant le desire.

Mais nepourquant Paour le tire,

Qâa lâun ne lâautre ne remire,

AinÃ§ois les ad tous refusÃ©;

Siq

Ne PecchÃ© ne le pot suffire,

Mais sanz esploit sont retornÃ©.

De ceste chose fuist dolent

PecchÃ©, quant par sâenticement

Mais ore oretz come falsement

Ly deable quant oÃ¿t cela,

Un petit se reconforta,

Et au PecchÃ© de ce parloit

Pour savoir ce qâelle en dirra,

Et si luy plest qâensi dorra

Com

ent les sept files du PecchÃ© vindront vers leur
mariage, et de leur arrai et de leur chiere.

Chascune soer endroit du soy

Lâun apres lâautre ove son conroi

Vint en sa guise noblement,

Enchivalchant par grant desroy;

Mais ce nâestoit sur palefroy,

Ne sur les mules dâorient:

Orguil qui vint primerement

Sâestoit montÃ© moult fierement

Sur un lio
u
n, qâaler en coy

Ne volt pour nul chastiement,
850

Ainz salt sur la menue gent,

Du qui tous furont en effroy.

Du selle et frein quoy vous dirray,

Du mantellet ou dâautre array?

Trestout fuist plain du queinterie;

Car unques prÃ©e flouriz en maii

Nâestoit au reguarder si gay

Des fleurs, com
m
e ce fuist du perrie:

Et sur son destre poign saisie

Une aigle avoit, que signefie
860

Quâil trestous autres a lâessay

Volt surmonter de sâestutye.

Ensi vint a la reverie

La dame dont parlÃ© vous ay.

Puis vint Envye en son degrÃ©,

Qâestoit dessur un chien montÃ©,

Et sur son destre poign portoit

Un esp
er
vier qâestoit muÃ©:

La face ot moult descolourÃ©

Et pale des mals que pensoit,
870

Et son mantell dont sâaffoubloit

Du purpre au droit devis estoit

Ove cuers ardans bien enbroudÃ©,

Et entre dâeux, qui bien seoit,

Du serpent langues y avoit

Par tout menuement poudrÃ©.

Apres Envye vint suiant

Sa soer dame Ire enchivalchant

Moult fierement sur un sengler,

Et sur son poign un cock portant.
880

Soulaine vint, car attendant

Avoit ne sergant nâescuier;

La cote avoit du fin acier,

Et des culteals plus dâun millier

Qâau coste luy furont pendant:

Trop fuist la dame a redouter,

Tous sâen fuiont de son sentier,

Et la lessont passer avant.

Dessur un asne lent et lass

Enchivalchant le petit pass
890

Puis vint Accidie loign derere,

Et sur son poign pour son solas

Tint un huan ferm p
ar
un las:

Si ot toutdis pres sa costiere

Sa couche faite en sa litiere;

Nâestoit du merriem ne de piere,

Ainz fuist de plom de halt en bass.

Si vint au feste en tieu maniere,

Mais aulques fuist de mate chere,

Pour ce qâassetz ne dormi pas.
900

Dame Avarice apres cela

Vint vers le feste et chivalcha

Sur un baucan qui voit toutdis

Dev
er
s la terre, et pour cela

Nulle autre beste tant prisa:

Si ot sur lâun des poigns assis

Un ostour qui sâen vait toutdis
[Pg 14]

Pour proye, et dessur lâautre ot mis

Un merlot qâen larcine va.

Des bources portoit plus q

910

Que tout de lâorr sont replenis:

Moult fuist lâonour qâom le porta.

Bien tost apres il me sovient

Que dame Gloutonie vient,

Que sur le lou sâest chivalchÃ©,

Et sur son poign un coufle tient,

Qâa sa nature bien avient;

Si fist porter pres sa costÃ©e

Beau cop de vin envessellÃ©:

Nâot guaire deux pass chivalchÃ©e,
920

Quant Yveresce luy survient,

Saisist le frein, si lâad menÃ©,

Et dist de son droit heritÃ©e

Que cel office a luy partient.

Puis vi venir du queinte atour

La dame qâad fait maint fol tour,

Câest Leccherie la plus queinte:
27

En un manteal de fol amour

Sist sur le chievre qâest lecchour,

En qui luxure nâest restreinte,
930

Et sur son poign soutz sa constreinte

f. 10

Porte un colomb; dont meint et meinte

Pour lâaguarder sâen vont entour.

Du beal colour la face ot peinte,

Oels vairs riantz, dont mainte e
n
peinte

Ruoit au fole gent entour.

Et dâautre part sans nul demeure

Le Siecle vint en mesme lâeure,

Et câestoit en le temps joly

Du Maii, quant la deesce Nature
940

Bois, champs et prÃ©es de sa verdure

Reveste, et lâoisel font leur cry,

Chantant deinz ce buisson flori,

Que point lâamie ove son amy:

Lors cils que vous nomay desseure

Les noces font, com

Moult furont richement servy

Sanz point, sanz reule et sanz mesure.

Ly deables ce qâestoit a faire
950

Tout ordena par son devis;

Si leur don

Trestout enfern a leur doaire.

Trop fuist la feste de grant pris;

Ly Siecle Orguil a fem

Et puis les autres toutes sis.

PecchÃ© leur Mere debon

Se mostra lors, mais Mort son fitz

Nâestoit illeoque a mon avis,

Dont fuist leur feste et joye maire.
960

Au table qâestoit principal

Pluto dâenfern Emperial

Ove Proserpine sâasseoit;

Puis fist seoir tout perigal

Le jofne mary mondial,

Qui richement se contienoit:

Puis sist PecchÃ©, qâove soy tenoit

Ses filles solonc leur endroit:

Mais pour servir dâespecial

Bachus la sale ministroit,
970

Et Venus plus avant servoit
28

Toutes les chambres del hostal.

Savoir poetz qâa celle feste

Riens y faillist qâestoit terreste,

Nyâ fuist absent ascune Vice,

Chascun pour bien servir sâapreste:

Mais sur trestous ly plus domeste,

Qui mieulx servoit de son office,

Câestoit Temptacio
u

Qâas tous plesoit de son service;
980

Car mainte delitable geste

Leur dist, dont il les cuers entice

Des jofnes dames au delice

Sanz cry, sanz noise et sanz te
m
peste.

Lors Gloutonie a grant mesure

Du large main mettoit sa cure

As grans hanaps du vin emplir,

Le quel versoit par envoisure

As ses sorours, Orguil, Luxure,

Car trop se peine a leur servir.
990

[Pg 15]

Des menestrals om pot oÃ¯r,

Que tout les firont rejoÃ¯r

Par melodie de nature:

Et pour solempnement tenir

Le feste, a toute gent ovrir

Les portes firont a toute hure.

Mais lâom
m

En ascultant, quant sâaparÃ§uit
29

Del tiel revel, du tiele joye,

La Char de luy par jour et nuyt
1000

De venir a si grant deduyt

Moult se pena diverse voie:

Mais lâAlme que Reso

Au Char que tielement foloie

Du Conscience ensi restuit,

Que partir ne sâen ose envoie;

Ainz pour le temps se tient tout coie,

Com

Ensi com
m
e je vous ay contÃ©,

Les filles furont mariÃ©
1010

Hors de les chambres enfernals

Au Siecle, qui les tint en grÃ©;

Car sur chascune en so
u
n degrÃ©

Cink autres laides et mortals

Puis engendra luy desloyals:

Moult sâentrâestoiont parigals
30

Les filles qâensi furont nÃ©e;

Car tous leur fais et leur consals

Sont contraire a lâespiritals

Du malice et soutiletÃ©.
1020

Entendre devetz tout avant,

Tous ceux dont vous irray contant,

Com
m
e puis orretz lâestoire dite,

Naiscont du merveillous semblant;

Car de nature a leur naiscant

Trestous sont mostre hermafodrite:

Sicome le livre mâen recite,

Ce sont quant double forme habite

Femelle et madle en un enfant:

Si no
u
n de fem

1030

Les filles dont je vous endite

Sont auci hom
m

Dont falt que lâAlme bien sâavise,

Que Reso
u

Pour soy defendre et saulf garder:

Les filles sont du tiele aprise,

Si bon
n

Moult tost la pourront enginer.

Dont si vous vuillez ascoulter,

Les no

1040

Et leur engin et leur queintise,

Com

Trestout pour lâAlme forsvoier;

Ore ascultez par quelle guise.

Orguil, des autres capiteine,

La nuyt gisoit tout primereine

Avoec le Siecle son amy:

PecchÃ© sa mere bien lâenseigne,

Que celle nuyt fuist chamberleine,

Com
m

1050

Tant lâacolla, tant le blandi,

Dont celle nuyt avint ensi,

Qe dame Orguil tout grosse et pleine

Devint, dont moult se rejoÃ¿.

Mais du primere qui nasqui

Je vous dirray verray enseigne.

Com
m

n
t le Siecle avoit cink files engendrez
dâOrguil, des quelles la prim
er

n
Ipocresie.

Des files qâOrguil enfantoit

La primeraine a no
u

Ma damoiselle Ipocresie:

Câest une file que vorroit
1060

Qâau seinte lâen la quideroit;

Pour ce du mainte fantasie

Compasse et fait sa guilerie:

Al oill se mostre et glorefie,

Dont par semblant la gent deÃ§oit:

Tant pl
us
come plourt ou p
re
che ou prie,

Tant pl
us
sâeslonge en sa partie

De dieu qui son corage voit.

Ipocresie est singulere

Devant les gens, no
u
n pas derere;

Car u plus voit lâassemblement
1071

Ou a moster ou a marchiere,

Ipocresie en la corniere

Se contient moult devoltement;
[Pg 16]

Et si nul povre de la gent

Lors quiert avoir de son argent,

Ipocresie est almosnere.

Car nul bien fait celeement

Pour dieu, ainz tout ap
er
tement

Pour la loenge seculere.
1080

Roys Ezechie, truis lisant,

Par cause quâil fuist demostrant

Le tresor qâot el temple dieu

As messagiers du Babilant,

Par le prophete devinant

Par force apres luy fuist tollu.

Par ceste essample est entendu

Que le tresor qâom ad reÃ§u,

Quel est a lâalme p
ar
tenant,

Ne soit apertement veeu
1090

Au siecle; car tout ert perdu,

Si lâen sâen vait glorifiant.
31

Ipocresie lâorguillouse

Resemble trop celestiouse;

Car par son dit tous mals argue,

Mais deinz son cuer maliciouse

Trop est mondeine et viciouse,

Quant tout au plain serra conue.

Ipocresie est a la veue

Du saint habit dehors vestue,
1100

Auci com
m
e lâaignel graciouse;

Mais en la fin, quant se desnue,

Si com
m
e le lou q
ue
lâaignel tue,

P
er
est cruele et p
er
illouse.

Ipocresie la no

nstable

Reprove quâil voit reprovable

En la condicio
u
n dâautri,

Mais son grant crime abhominable,

Dont mesmes est en soy coupable,

Ne parle, ainz tout met en oubli.
1110

DâIpocresie il est ensi,

Elle ad la face dâorr burny,

Et lâoill du cristal amiable,

Mais p
ar
dedeins le cuer de luy

Tout est du plom, mat et failly,

Et du merdaille no
u
nvaillable.

Dieus lâipocrite ad resemblÃ©

f. 11

Au beal sepulcre qâest dorrÃ©,

Dehors tout plain dâymagerie,

Mais pardedeinz y gist muscÃ©
1120

Puant caroigne et abhosmÃ©,

Que lâipocrite signefie:

Car pardehors ypocrisie

Resplent du sainte apparantie,

Mais p
ar
dedeinz le cuer celÃ©e

Gist toute ordure et tricherie:

Dont lâen poet lire en YsaÃ¯e

Coment tieux gens sont malurÃ©.

Ipocresie est ensi belle,

Sicome ly verm q
ue
lâen appelle
1130

Noctiluca, câest tant a dire
32

Luisant de nuit sicom
m
e chandelle,

Mais du cler jour q
ue
riens concelle

Quant hom le voit et le remire,

Lors câest un verm qâom fait despire,

Que riens ne valt en nul empire.

Ipocresie ensi porte elle

Apparisance du martire,

Mais au jour devant n
ost
re sire

Lors appara come chaitivelle.
1140

Ipocresie dâautre guise

Soy mesmes vilement despise

Devant tous en comun audit,

Et tout ce fait du fole enprise,

Au fin q
ue
lâen le loe et prise:

Dont saint Bernard, âHelas!â ce dist,

âIls ce font deable dâespirit,

Que lâen les tiene en leur habit

Corsaint du lâangeline aprise.â

Mais lâangle qui du ciel chaÃ¯t
1150

Dâun tiel corsaint moult sâesjoÃ¯t,

Qâensi sciet faire sa queintise.

Ipocresie est accusÃ©

De sotie et soutiletÃ©:

Car il est sot tout voirement,

Quant il son corps par aspretÃ©

Du grief penance ad affligÃ©,

Et sâalme nul merite en prent;
33

Il est en ce sot ensement,

Qâau corps tolt le sustienement
1160

Et paist le Siecle et le malfÃ©e;

Mais sur tout plus fait sotement,
[Pg 17]

Quâil quide guiler lâautre gent,

Dont mesmes est au fin guilÃ©.

Trop est soutil a demesure,

Quant il deÃ§oit en sa mesure

Tous autres qâont en luy credence,

Emblant par false coverture

Les dignetÃ©s dont om lâonure

Du foy parfaite et rev
er

1170

Mais ove soy mesmes mal despense,

Quant il son corps met en despense

Pour sâalme anientir et destrure:

Trop ad tempeste en conscience

Qâove lâun et lâautre ensemble tence,

Dont lâun et lâautre est en lesure.

Lâom
m
e ypocrite en son endroit

Parentre deux est en destroit;

Car deux debletz luy vont te
m
ptant:

Lâun dist quâil bien mangue et boit

Derere gent, par quoy quâil soit
1181

Au siecle bell et apparant;

Mais lâautre en est contrariant,
34

Et dist quâil serra poy mangant,

Si qâom le pale et megre voit

Au saint prodhom
m
e resemblant:

Trop est soubtil ymaginant

Cil qâa ces deux accorder doit.

Ipocrisie en dieu prier

As autres ne poet p
ro
ufiter
1190

Et a soy mesmes fait dam
m
age:

Car quant du siecle quert loer,

Nâest droit q
ue
dieus lâen doit loer.

Mais ce dist Augustin ly sage,

Qui prie dâindevoult corage

Il prie contre son visage

Le juggement qâom doit doubter.

Mieulx valsist dâestre sanz langage

MuÃ«t sicom

Qâensi fole oreiso

1200

La seconde file dâOrguil, quelle ad a no
u
n Vaine
gloire.

La Vaine gloire, qâest seconde,

De son sen et de sa faconde

Câest une dame trop mondeine:

Car pour la vanitÃ© du monde

Son corps ove tout dont elle abonde

Despent et gaste en gloire veine:

Tout se travaille et tout se peine

Pour estre appellÃ© cheventeine,

Du quoy son vein honour rebonde.

Si tiel honour tient en demeine,
1210

Lors est si fiere et si halteine

Quâil nâad parail qâa luy responde.

La Vaine gloire dâoultre mer

Par tout se peine a travailler,

Plus pour conquerre los et pris

Du mond pour son no
u
n eshalcer,

Que pour servir et honourer

Dieu pour lâonour du paradis.

La Veine gloire en son paiis

Controve et fait novel devys
1220

De vestir et apparailler.

Quant Veine gloire est poestis,

Tous ceaux qui sont a luy soubgis

Sovent leur estoet genuller.

Du Veine gloire ly client

Ne soeffre ja son garnement

Ne son souler ne sa chaulÃ§ure

Estre enboez, ainz nettement

Qanq
ue
est dehors al oill du gent

Parant, le garde en sa mesure,
1230

Si quâil nâait tache en sa vesture;

Mais celle tache et celle ordure

Des vices, dont son cuer esprent,

Ne voet monder, ainz met sa cure

Au corps, et lâalme a no
u
nchalure

Laist enboer tresvilement.

Trop est la Veine gloire gay

Du vesture et tout autre array;

Mais quant avient par aventure

Que celle dame sanz esmay
1240

Sâest acemÃ© du suhgenay,

Ove la pierrouse botenure

Du riche entaille a sa mesure,

He, qui lors prise la faiture,

Disant que câest la belle maii

Et la tresbelle creature,

Ne quide lors q
ue
dieus dessure

La poet forsfaire en nul essay.
[Pg 18]

Mais courtement pour terminer,

La Veine gloire seculer
1250

Trop sâesjoÃ¿t du vein honour,

Du pris, ren
ou
n, avoir, poer,

Du sen, science et bealparler,

Du beautÃ©, force et de valour,

Du riche array, du beal atour,

Du fort chastel, de halte tour,

Et quâil les gens poet com
m
ander:

Mieulx quide dâestre creatour

Que creature: he, quel folour,

Qâau mesme dieu voet guerroier!
1260

La Veine gloire laisse nient

Que toutdis ove soy ne retient

La cornette et la chalemelle,

Pour solacer, u quâil devient:

Tous en parlont, âVei la qâil vient,
35

Vei la, qui sur tous mieulx revelle!â

Quant il asculte leur favelle,

Que tous luy prisont, cil et celle,

Tieu veine gloire luy survient,

Orguil luy monte en la cervelle,
1270

Dont sâalme laisse chaitivelle,

Et son corps glorious maintient.

Du bon saint Job tieu sont ly dit,

Que le vain hom
m
e sâesjoÃ¿t

De la musike dâestrument;

Mais quant il plus sâen rejoÃ¿t,

Lors en un point du mort soubit

En la dolour dâenfern decent.

Auci parlant de tiele gent

Dist YsaÃ¯e tielement,
1280

Que toute gloire et vain delit,

Que le vain siecle en soy comp
re
nt,

Serra tornÃ© soudainement

En le desert qâest infinit.

Saint YsaÃ¯e demandoit

De Baruch, a quoy il queroit

En ceste vie a soy leesce,

Depuisq
ue
dieus envoieroit

Sur toute gent qâen terre soit

Pesance, dolour et tristesce.
1290

Johel auci cela confesse,

Qâau fin ert Veine gloire oppresse

Et tout confuse par destroit;

Dont cils qui vuillont par noblesce

Monter la seculere haltesce

Devont descendre a mal exploit.

Solonc le dit dâun sage auctour,

Gloire au riche hom
m
e câest honour:

Du qui lâescript evangelin

Dit, quant es foires fait son tour,
1300

Trop ayme qâautre gent menour

Le saluent par bass enclin,

Com
m
e sâil fuist Charles ou Pepin;

Ne voet porter no
u
n du voisin,

Mais no
u
n du maistre et du seigno
ur
:

Si quert avoir lâonour terrin

As festes, car sicom
m
e divin

f. 12

Devant tous quert le see primour.

Mais si riche hom
m
e honour desire,

Du cause vient qâa ce luy tire;
1310

Mais lâom
m
e povre qâest haltein

Et quert lâonour avoir du sire,

Quant il nâad propre seal ne cire,

Ne riens dont poet paier u mein,

Cil quert sa gloire trop en vein:

Car povre Orguil, je suy certein,

Com
m
e Salomon le fait descrire,

Câest un des quatre plus vilein,

Que mesmes dieu tient en desdeign,

Et a bon droit le fait despire.
1320

Ascun sa gloire vait menant

En soul sa malvoistÃ© fesant,

Nâen quert honour, ainz quert le vice,

Du quoy sâen vait glorifiant.

Dâun tiel David vait demandant:

âA quoy fais gloire en ta malice

Tu qâes puissant du malefice?â

Ne say queu deble a ce tâentice,

Quant nulle part porras p
ar
tant

Avoir honour ne benefice:
1330

Trop est ta gloire veine et nice,

Dont nul p
ro
fit te vient suiant.

O Gloire que tant es estoute,

Ce que saint Job te dist ascoulte:

Il dist, âSi fuissez eshalcez

Jusques au ciel, enmy la route
[Pg 19]

Tu encherres, car dieus te boute,

Et come fymer au fin serres

Purriz, perduz et avilez.â

Auci de ce tâad doctrinez
1340

Ly sages, qui te dist sanz doubte

De les humaines vanitÃ©s,

En plour et doel ert occupiez

Le fin du Veine gloire toute.

Au Veine gloire est resemblÃ©

Lâestorbuillon desmesurÃ©,

Que par soufler de sa tempeste

Devant sa voie ad tout ruÃ©

Le fruyt dont lâarbre sont chargÃ©:

Qâen tiele guise se tempeste
1350

La Veine gloire en hom
m
e honeste;

Car tout le bien q
ue
lâom
m
e aqueste,

Dont lâalme a dieu soit honourÃ©,

Tieu gloire en soy le deshoneste;

Si torne joye en grief moleste

Et en no
u
nsaint la saintetÃ©.

La Vaine gloire ad Fole emprise,

Câest un servant du grant reprise,

Qui tous jours fait son mestre enp
re
ndre

Les faitz qui sont de halt emprise,
1360

Au fin que lâautre gent luy prise,

Dont vain honour pourra comprendre.

Et pour cela tout fait despendre,

Corps, biens et temps sanz prou rep
re
ndre,

Fors soul le vent, qâau dos luy frise.

Sâil poet en vain honour ascendre,

Le corps laist travailler en cendre,

Mais lâalme en pert toute franchise.
36

Encore une autre soe amie

Ad Vaine gloire en compaignie,
1370

Que par droit no
u
n est appellÃ©

Ma damoiselle Flaterie,

Que par tout est tresbien oÃ¯e,

Et des seignours moult bien amÃ©:

Câest celle qui dâun page au piÃ©e

Fait qâen la court est allevÃ©

A grant estat du seigneurie;

Câest celle sur tous plus secrÃ©e,

Quant consail serra demandÃ©,

Car a son dit nâest qui repplie.
1380

Lâen poet bien dire que Flatour

Est un soubtil enchanteour;

Car par son vein enchantement

Fait croire au dame et au seigno
ur

Que sur tous autres de valour

Sont plus digne et plus excellent:
37

Mais nâont du bontÃ© soulement

Un point, mais par blandisement

Il leur tresgette un si fals tour,

Pour avoegler la vaine gent,
1390

Quâil quidont veoir clerement

Ce quâil ne verront a nul jour.

Mais Flaterie trop mesfait

Quant elle excuse le mesfait

Et en apert et en silence,

Et fait resembler a bien fait

Par argument qâest contrefait,

Du quoy la veine gent ensense:

Et pour gaigner un poi despense

Avoec lâautri pecchÃ© despense,
1400

Et le p
ro
cure qâom le fait,

Dont suit mainte inconvenience

Dâorguil et fole incontinence,

Dont maint hom
m
e ad estÃ© desfait.

Pour resembler Flatour, est cil

Semblable au coue du goupil,

Que le viltÃ© cov
er
e au derere;

Car ly flatour ensi fait il,

Tout qanqâil voit en lâautri vil

Du pecchÃ© cov
er
e en tieu maniere:
1410

Et auci il est menÃ§ongere,

Car sâun soul point en lâautre piere

Du bien, il en dirra tieu mil:
38

Solonc quâil voit changer ta chere

Se torne avant et puis arere;

Trop pent sa lange a pliant fil.

Quoy que lâen parle du folie,

Toutdis lâen verras Flaterie

A lâautry dit estre acordant:
1419

âBienâ dist toutdis si lâen âbienâ die,

Et sâom dist âmal,â lors âmalâ replie,

Et si lâen rit, il est riant;
[Pg 20]

Car sa parole et son semblant

Tout ert a lâautri resemblant:

Ne plus ne meinz ce signefie

Eccho, que qanqâ om est sonant,

De la response est resonant

Tout dâun acord et dâune oÃ¿e.

As fils pour ce de lâadv
er
ser

La Flaterie en son mestier
1430

Est la norrice et la guardeine:

Si les endormist en peccher

Par son chanter et mailoller

En allaitant du gloire veine;

Mais puis les hoste a mal estreine

De la mamelle qâest mondeine,

Dont suef les faisoit allaiter,

Et lors en p
er
durable peine

Dâenfern, u q
ue
ly deable enseigne,

Sanz fin les fait escoleier.
1440

La tierce file dâOrguil, la quelle ad a no
u
n
Surquiderie.

La tierce fille par decente

Qe dame Orguil au mond p
re
sente,

Lâen appella Surquiderie.

Celle est du cuer tant excellente,

Que dâacun autre ne talente

Avoir pareill en ceste vie.

Ly clercs qui ceste file guie

Tout quide en sa philosophie

Quâil Aristotle represente;

De les sept ars se glorifie,
1450

Quant soul logique ne sciet mie

Le firmament trestout extente.

Ly Surquiders bien quide et croit

Du quelq
ue
vertu qâa luy soit,

Que par ce tous vait surmontant.

De son quider trop se deÃ§oit:

Quant il meinz valt en son endroit,

Lors quide avoir nul comparant.

Ly Surquiders, sicome lâenfant,

Qe sa pelote est plus amant
1460

Que tout le tresor que lâen voit,

Dâun petit bien se vait loant,

Dont il se quide estre auci grant

Come lâemperour du Rome estoit.

Ly Surquiders, quant il est fortz,

Quide a lier lions et tors,

Dont il a Sampson contrevaile:

Ly Surquiders, eiant beals corps,

Quant se remire, il quide lors

Resembler Absolon dâentaile:
1470

Ly Surquiders hardis sanz faile

Tout quide a veintre la bataile,

Sicome fist Lancellot et Boors.

Quant Surquider les gens consaile,

Nâest pas certain son divinaille,

Ne ses augurres ne ses sortz:

Mais nepourquant par sâenticer

Sovent as gens fait comencer

Tieu chose que jam
m
ais nul jour

Ne la pourront bien terminer;
1480

Dont en la fin leur falt ruer

De sus en jus leur grant honour,

Leur sen deschiet en grant folour,

Et leur richesce en povre atour;

Leur peas destourne en guerroier,

Leur repos chiet en grant labour,

Tornent leur joyes en dolour:

Vei la le fin du Surquider!
39

Surquiderie est celle tour,

MurÃ© du fort orguil entour,
1490

En quel ly deable a son voloir

Gart tout lâespiritel errour

Des tous pecchÃ©s en leur folour

Dessoutz le clief du fol espoir.

Car cil qâest surquidous pour voir,

Combien quâil soit du g
ra
nt savoir,

Ly deable en tolt le fruit et flour,

f. 13

Et soul le fuill luy laist avoir,

Le quel dâun vent dâorguil movoir

Fait et lâabat au chief du tour.
1500

Ly Surquiders que plus amonte

Est cil qâad perdu toute honte;

Car pour nul bien q
ue
dieus luy don
n
e,

Pour adjugger au droit accompte,

Ne rent au dieu reso
u
n ne conte;

Ainz quide, qanq
ue
luy fuisson
n
e,

Que destinÃ© luy habandon
n
e

Pour la vertu de sa person
n
e,
[Pg 21]

Dont il les autres tout surmonte.

Mais qant meux quide avoir coron
n
e,

Dieu de sâonour luy descoron
n
e,
1511

Et de son halt en bass desmonte.

Ly Surquiders est singuler,

Qâa nully voet acompaigner,

Car il ad celle enfermetÃ©

Que plus sâagregge par toucher;

Et pour cela lâen solt nom
m
er

Le mal
Noli me tangere
.

Car Surquiders en nul degrÃ©

Lâautry toucher ne prent en grÃ©,
1520

Ou soit en fait ou en parler,

Ainz en devient dâorguil enflÃ©:
40

Car tout quide a sa volentÃ©

Le siecle a son voloir mener.

Surquiderie au compaigno
u
n

Retient ove soy Presumpcio
u
n,

Que tant du fol orguil esprent,

Quâil quide tout le divin do
u
n

Pour son merite en reguerdo
u
n

Avoir deservy duement.
1530

Un clercs dist que presumement

Est traitres et confondement

Dâumaine cogitacio
u
n

Dedeinz le cuer secretement:

Car tout le bien qâa lâalme appent

Perverte a sa dampnacio
u
n.

Presumpcio
u
n qâorguil desguise

DeÃ§oit les gens par mainte guise,

Et les saintz hom
m
es molt sovent,

Quant ils quidont de son aprise,
1540

Pour saintetÃ© quâils ont enprise,

Quâils valont plus q
ue
lâautre gent;

Dont veine gloire les susprent,

Et font des autres juggement,

Quâils sont coupable a la Juise;

Et deinz soy surquidousement

Pensont qâau dieu plenerement

Ont tout bien fait sanz nul mesp
ri

Presumptuouse veine gloire

Trestout attrait a sa memoire
1550

La sainte vie qâad menÃ©;

Dont en certain se fait a croire

Que lâen ne trove en nulle histoire

Un autre de sa saintetÃ©:

Et si luy vient prosperitÃ©,

Bon los, quiete, ou ameistÃ©,

Ou du bataille la victoire,

Tout quide avoir par duetÃ©

Deservy; siqâen tieu degrÃ©

Sa bontÃ© blanche refait noire.
1560

Presumpcio
u

Est tielement en soy guilÃ©e,

Sicom
m

Quant en sa voie voit gettÃ©

Le mirour, dont quant sâest mirÃ©,

Lors quide apertement sanz guile

Veoir dedeinz son filz ou file:

Mais ly venour trop se soubtile,

Qâove soy les ad tous asportÃ©.

Ensi ly deables prent et pile
1570

Quanq

Quant quide avoir, tout est alÃ©.

Au presumptive gent câestoit

Qâen lâevangile dieu disoit:

âJe vous ay,â fait il, âhonourÃ©,

Et vous par orguillous endroit,

Encontre courtoisie et droit,

Mâavetz au fin deshonourÃ©.â

Car pour bien ne prosperitÃ©,

Qâau tiele gent dieus ad don
n
Ã©,
1580

Ne pour vertu le quelq
ue

Des tieus nâert dieu regraciÃ©;

Mais come ce fuist leur p
ro
pretÃ©,

Chascun sur soy les biens reÃ§oit.

De la presumptuouse rage

Aucun y a, ce dist ly sage,

Qui quide nestre franchement,

Qâau dieu nâen doit aucun servage,

Nient plus q
ue
lâasne qâest salvage,

Qâau bois sanz frein jolyement
1590

Sâen court trestout a son talent,

Mais qui luy fist primerement,

Ne qui luy don

Ne sciet; et ensi folement

Se contient sanz amendement

Ly presumptif deinz son corage.
[Pg 22]

Pour ce ly sage Salomon

Ce dist: âO tu, Presumpcio

O tu malvoise, o tu vilaine,

Qui te crea?â Dy et respo

1600

Qui te don

Quant tu rien as mais dâautri do

Presumpcio

Cousine de Surquiderie,
1610

Câest Vaine curiositÃ©,

Qâest dâorguillouse fantasie;

Car tous jours serche lâautri vie,

Et de soy ne sâest remembrÃ©:

Trop se fait sage et surquidÃ©e,

Quant sciet et jugge en son degrÃ©

Tous autres, et soy ne sciet mie.

Dont Bernard dist, âTrop ad tornÃ©

Sa sapience en vanitÃ©

Cil qâautri sciet et soy oublie.â
1620

Mais de la curiouse gent,

Qâensi presumptuousement

Scievont et juggont chacuny,

En lâevangile proprement

Dieus dist q
ue
pour leur juggement

ForsjuggÃ© serront et puny.

Par IsaÃ¯e dieus auci

Dist quâil destruiera p

La sapience au sapient,

Qui se fait sage de lâautry;
1630

Mais fals orguil tout prent sur luy,

Come câil fuist sire omnipotent.

De lâorguillouse Surquidance

Vous dy quâelle ad de sâaqueintance

Derision, qui dâorguil rit

Tous autres de sa mesdisance,

Leur fait, leur dit, leur contenance

Escharne et mocke par despit:

Car dieus tiel hom

s ne fist

Si vertuous ne si parfit
1640

Que cil musard ne desavance,

Et par escharn et par mesdit

Lâautry vertus par contreplit

Des vices torne a la semblance.

Saint Job se plaignt disant ensi:

âDes tieux,â ce dist, âsuy escharni

Qui meindre sont du temps et age.â

Saint Job se plaignt disant auci,

Que la simplesce de celluy

Qâest just et humble de corage
1650

Ly derisour le desparage.

Mais un grant clerc qâestoit bien sage,

Maximian dist, qui dâautri

Desrit, nâert mesmes sanz partage,

Ainz en desris et en hontage

Le fin doit revertir sur luy.

Dedeinz la bible essample truis,

Qâescharn au fin serra perduz,

Mais sur tous mals pis leur faisoit

Cils du paiis en leur endroit,

Quant chascun les escharnisoit:

Mais leur escharn de sus en jus

Dieu moult soudeinement changoit;

Enmy la rouge mer salvoit

Les uns, et lâautres ad conclus.

Ce nous dist sage Salomon,

Que vile abhominacio

A dieu sont tout ly derisour:

Et pour ce la dampnacio

De ce David nous est auctour,

Qâau dieu fait reclamacio

Que lâen appelle Malapert.

Par tout u cil pourra venir,

Honte et Vergoigne fait suÃ¯r

Pour mals quâil leur dist en apert:
[Pg 23]

Car moult sovent a descovert

Dist chose que serroit covert,

Pour les gens simples escharnir;
1689

f. 14

Mais coment quâil as autres sert,

Lâen trove au court, jâen suy bien cert,

Qui volentiers le voet oÃ¯r.

Si centz fuissont en compaignie,

Soul Malapert du janglerie

Trestous les serroit surmontant:

Plus est jolys que nâest la pie,

Devant les autres dance et crie,

U que la p

Car il surquide que son chant

Soit molt plus douls et plus plesant
41

1700

Que soit nulle autre melodie,

Et que son corps soit avenant;

Pour ce se moustre et met avant,

Que rien luy chalt qoi nuls en die.
42

Cil Malapert ly bealpinÃ©e,

Alant le pass engalopÃ©e

Ove la ceinture bass assisse,

Par tout, u vient a lâassemblÃ©e,

A luy se sont tout ascoultÃ©e,

Quâil endirra du fole aprise;
1710

Car si nuls soit deinz la pourprise

Curtois sanz nul vilain enprise,

Cil Malapert ly malsenÃ©e

Par contrefait tout le devise:

Si lâautre en ad response mise,
43

Lors serra son escharn doublÃ©e.

Pour ce tâen fait ly sage ap
re

Que derisour ne dois rep

Car cil qui derisour reprent,

Quert a soy mesmes tache p

1720

Car jam

Le bien de ton chastiement,

Pour ce lâen dist, tu dois entendre

Que chien dormant aucunement

1740

Le Vanteour de plus en plus

De vanter ne sâest abstenus,

Dont croit quâil son honour remonte:

Car sâil soit beals ou fortz ou prus,

Au fin qâas tous ce soit conus,

Et sâil soit riches, lors acompte

Qui bien entent les ditz des sages

Et sâorguillist, il est no

Car sâil soit beals et pense oultrages,

Si dist que lâoill de son voiant

Perest si fieble en reguardant,

Quâil plus ne voit fors les ymages

Petite mosche au fort destrer.

Saint Augustin sâen fait parler,

Si dist, âO force, tien te coy;

Quant tu la puice resister

Ne puis au lit pour reposer,

Et sâom se vante de richesce,

Tiel ta parole expressera.â

Ce piert dâorguil, qâen son oultrage

De sa science et son lignage

Et de ses biens se vantera:

Car ses vertus tout contera,

Au fin que tous sachont cela,
1820

Siquâil nâait pier du voisinage

En la CitÃ© u tiel esta:

Com
m
e Salomon le tesmoigna,

Sovent lâen voit venir dam
m
age.

Par so
u
n p
ro
phete Sephonie

Dieus dist que gens de vanterie

Dâentour les soens il hostera.

Si dist auci par Jeremie

Que la vantante halte vie

De halt en bass la ruera,
1830

Toute arrogance humilera:

Et ensi dieus nous manaÃ§a

Par Salomon et IsaÃ¯e:

âHeu,â dist, âcil qui se vantera!

Par ce toutdis de luy serra

Trestoute vertu forsbanie.â

Del phariseu lâen vait lisant

Pour ce qâel temple son avant

De ses bienfaitz au dieu faisoit,

Son pris perdist de maintenant
1840

Et son loer du bienfesant:

Mais cil qui pupplican estoit

Tout autrement se contienoit,

De ses mesfais mercy prioit:

Dont lâun, qâert juste p
ar
devant,

De son avant se p
er
vertoit,

Et lâautre, qui devant pecchoit,

Devint just par soy despisant.

Ce dist Solyn en lâescripture:

âOssifragus de sa nature
1850

Câest un oisel qui soulement

Du moel des oss prent sa pasture;

Mais quant ne poet par aventure

Lâoss debriser, lors monte au vent

Volant en halt, et guarde prent

Dâascune roche, et tielement

Puis laist chaoir lâoss p
ar
dessure,

Que tout en pieces le purfent:

Ensi devoure a son talent

Sa proie p
ar
my la fendure.â
1860

Ly deable auci p
ar

Pour faire lâom
m
e saint muable,
[Pg 25]

Primerement le fait monter

En vaine gloire surquidable,

Et par ce fait quâil est cheable

Dessur la roche de vanter.

Ce dist David en son psalter:

âQui dâorguil fait son cuer lever,

Dieus contre luy se fait levableâ:

Et ensi com
m

1870

Le fiert, dont lâestoet tresbuscher

Si bass dont puis nâest relevable.

De Lucifer hom vait lisant,

Tantost quâil ust fait son avant,

Quâil volt le see divin ascendre

Et resembler au toutpuissant,

Dieus le rua de maintenant

Jusqâen abisme, et fist descendre

El fieu qui toutdiz art sanz cendre.

f. 15

En ciel fist dieus vengance p

Dâorguil qui sâen aloit vantant:
1881

Par ce poet om essample p
re

Que bobancers fait a rep
re

Car il au deable est resemblant.

La vanterie en terre auci

Dieus hiet et toutdis ad haÃ¯.

Du Nabugod ce poet om lire,

Qui se vantoit jadys ensi

Quâil Babiloyne ot establi

En gloire de son halt empire:
1890

Mais ainz quâil pot au plain suffire

Son grant orguil vanter et dire,

Soudainement tout sâesvany,

Et transmua par le dieu ire

Sa forme dâom
m
e en beste pire

Sept au

46

Simon Magus qua
n
t se vantoit

Qâen halt le ciel voler vorroit,

Par lâart magike en lâair bien sus

Au Rome en son orguil montoit;
1900

Mais quant plus halt mont
er
quidoit,
47

Soudainement dieus lâot confus,

Et de son halt le ruoit jus;

Dont il le corps ot confundus,

Et lâalme as deables sâen aloit.

Vei la le gaign qâen orguil truis:

Quant lâen se vante estre au dessus,

Par cas plus tost chaoir lâen doit.
48

Par autre guise sâest vantÃ©

Le Vanteour desmesurÃ©,
1910

Dont luy maldie Jh
es
u Crist:

Car si dâamour tout en secrÃ©

Soit dâune dame bien amÃ©,

En soy vantant par tout le dist,

Dont lâautre honour trop amerrist.

Plust ore a dieu cil qâensi fist,

Ou fait, ou fra, fuist forsjuggÃ©,

Et par la goule en halt pendist;

Quant faire pecchÃ© ne suffist,

Mais qâom se vante du pecchÃ©.
1920

O dieus, com
m
ent il se desroie

Le Vanteour, quant il donnoie,

Seant dâencoste ses amours!

Câest cil alors qui tout mestroie,

Câest cil qui terre ad et monoie,

Câest cil qui sciet trestous honours,

Câest cil qâest fort en grans estours,

Câest cil qui conquerra les tours,

Câest cil qui valt par toute voie;

Sa langue est plaine des valours,
1930

Mais plus p
ro
mette en quatre jours

Qâen cinquant ans ne compleroie.

Car qui sâavante volenters,

Sovent avient quâil est mentiers,

Contant du soy que ja nâestoit:

Sâil nâait en bource deux deniers,

Il dist quâil ad ses tresorers

Pour achater que bon luy soit,

Dont sa largesce faire doit.

Tieu conquerrour lâen loeroit,
1940

Car sâil soit dâarmes custum
m
ers,

Il dist tieu chose p
ar
ferroit,

La quelle enprendre nâoseroit

Pour tout lâavoir du Montpellers.

Tout ensement come le paintour,

Quant il portrait un grant estour,

Fiert les grans cops en sa painture,

Tout autreci ly Vanteour

En recontant de sa valour
49

Se vante et parle a demesure:
1950

[Pg 26]

Mainte merveille et aventure,

Sa grosse langue afferme et jure

De son sen et de sa folour,

Du peas et dâarmes, qâa nulle hure

Estoient voir, ainz controveure,

Dont quide eshalcer son honour.

Le Vanteour sovent sur soy

Emprent quâil est privÃ© du Roy,

Si quâil nâen poet avoir essoigne;

Et dist as gens, âParlez au moy:
1960

Si vous me don
n
ez le pourquoy,

Je fray lâexploit de vo busoigne.â

Jaket son varlet le tesmoigne,

Et dist au fin q
ue
lâen luy doigne,

âTout est ce voir, tenez ma foy.â

Ensi les larges do
u
ns enpoigne;

Mais en la fin câest grant vergoigne,

Car sa vantance est tout gabboy.

Sicom
m
e du vertu corporal,

Quant orguil par especial
1970

Devant les autres ad le grÃ©,

Se vante et fait desp
ar
igal,

Tout ensi de lâespirital,

Quant fait aucune charitÃ©,

Ou soit apert ou soit privÃ©,

Au double ou plus sâen est vantÃ©,

Com
m
e sâil fuist tout celestial:

Siq
ue
les biens du tout degrÃ©,

Dont corps et alme sont doÃ©,

Sa langue soule torne en mal.
1980

Le Vanteour de sa semblance

Porte au geline resemblance,

Que de ses oefs criant entour

Sâen vait, dont lâen ap
ar
cevance

Prent de son ny, si qâau finance

Tout pert ses oefs par sa clamour:

Et ensi fait ly Vanteour;

Quant il ad fait aucun bon tour,

Nâel voet celer, ainz par bobance

Sâen vante pour acquere honour
50

1990

Au corps; mais lâalme au darrein jo
ur

Sâen vait sanz part du bienfaisance.

Mais pour descrire en sa maniere,

Ly Vanteour est ly fol liere,

Qui tout sâafforce en sa covine

Dâembler la gloire a dieu le piere,

A qui tout honour se refiere;

Mais il le tolt de sa ravine

Et a soy p
ro
pre le destine.

Par quoy du redde discipline
2000

Drois est quâil son orguil compiere:

Pour sâavantance qâest terrine

En paine que jam
m
ais ne fine

De son avant ert mis derere.

La quinte file dâOrguil, la quelle ad a no
u
n
Inobedience.

La quinte, ensi come je le pense,

Son no
u
n est Inobedience;

Qâa nully voet estre soubgis

Pour dignetÃ© ne pour science,

Ne porte a nully rev
er
ence,

Tant ad le cuer dâorguil espris.
2010

Câest un pecchÃ© par quoy ly fitz

Sovent des pieres sont malditz,

Quant par vertu dâobedience

Ne vuillont estre bien apris.

Câest un pecchÃ© qâa son avis

Nâad cure de la dieu offence.

Câest un pecchÃ© de son mester

Qui taire voet quant dust parler,

Et quant dust p
ar
ler se voet taire.

Câest un pecchÃ© qâapostazer
2020

Fait maint et mainte reguler,

Trestout lessant et frocke et haire.

Câest un pecchÃ© qui fait desplaire

La fem
m
e qui nâest debon
n
aire

Au mary, qui la volt amer.

Câest un pecchÃ© qui le contraire

En toutes choses vorra faire,

Qâa nul bien se voet acorder.

Câest un pecchÃ© qâad trop de peine,

Quant force a servir le constreine;
2030

Sovent grondile a bass suspir,

Trop ad la volentÃ© vileine.

Qui plus dâamour vers luy se peine

Del faire aler ou retenir,

Tant plus se fait desobeÃ¯r:

Si plus ne puet contretenir,
[Pg 27]

Tout maldirra du bass aleine,

Qâau nulle loy voet obeÃ¯r,

Pour faire droit ne droit suffrir

Nâa son p
ro
chein nâa sa p
ro
cheine.
2040

Câest un pecchÃ© que son amant

Aprent quâil soit desobeissant

Vers dieu et vers son voisinage:

Vers qui des deux soit malfaisant,

Jam
m
ais du grÃ© nâert repentant,

Dont confesser voet le dam
m
age,

Ne faire peas de son oultrage.

Ne croit qâau dieu doit son hom
m
age,

Et a tout autre rien vivant

Il ad contraire le corage:
2050

Nul le pourra treter si sage,

Qâas autres le face acordant.

Desobeisance en sa pectrine

Ad le cuer dur plus que perrine,

Que nâamollist aucunement

Pour la divine discipline,

Que dieu par droite medicine

Envoit pour son amendement:

Ainz, quanq
ue
dieus benignement

Luy don
n
e a son relievement,
2060

Il le destorne a sa ruine;

Et pour ce qâen grÃ© ne le prent,

Du double mal la paine attent

En fieu dâenfern, qui ja ne fine.

Quant ceste file se mesprent

Vers dieu, et dieu revengement

Prent en pitÃ©, dont lâen chastie,
51

Ou soit par mort de son parent,

Ou soit du perte ou dâaccident,

f. 16

De blesceure ou de maladie,

Orguil de ce dieu ne mercie;
2071

Ainz en tenÃ§ant trestout deffie
52

Encontre le chastiement

De dieu, mais puis de sa folie

Ne pert tantsoulement la vie,

Mais lâalme p
er
durablement.

Car saint Gregoire bien le dist,

Solonc que truis en son escript,

Que dieu chastie son amy,

Tanquâil a soy lâad fait soubgit:
2080

Mais sâil avient par autre plit

Quâil ne sâament, ainz en oubli

Met le chastiement de luy,

Câest un vray signe qâa celluy

Dieus ad sa grace tout desdit,

Et voet au fin quâil soit peri;

Dont son orguil soit remeri,

Quant corps et alme ensemble occit.

Grant mal vient par desobeissance;

Lâapostre en porte tesmoignance,
53

2090

Disant que par desobeÃ¯r

DâAdam primer vint la vengance,

Dont naiscons serf et en penance;

Nâest un qui ce poet eschuÃ¯r:

Moises le dist, cil qâobeÃ¯r

Ne voet al dieu precept tenir

Solonc la divine observance,

Il doit par juggement morir;

Dont puis sanz fin lâestoet perir,

Et languir en desesp
er
ance.
2100

Del unicorn ce dist Solyn,

Nâel poet danter aucun engin,

Mais moert ainz qâom le poet danter,

Tant ad le cuer gross et ferin.

Orguil ensi le fol cristin

Sanz obeÃ¯r le fait errer

Du bon
n
e aprise et salvager;

Par quoy ne sciet son dieu amer,

Ne vivre egal ove son voisin,

Tout ordre fait desordener,
2110

Nâad cure du loy seculer,

Ne doubte du precept divin.

Cil qâInobedience meine

Resemble au corps du char humeine

Qâest mort, dont om ne poet plier

Les membres; car pour nulle peine

Au sov
er
ein nâau sov
er
eine

Orguil se voet humilier.

Mais cil qui voet le mont monter,

AinÃ§ois lâestoet le doss courber
2120

Quâil truist la voie droite et pleine:

Orguil pour ce ne poet durer

Amont le ciel en halt aler,

Car ne sâabesse a nul enseine.
[Pg 28]

Urse et Lio
u
n qui sont salvage,

Ostour et la faucon ramage,
54

Dedeinz un an jusques au mein

Lâen poet danter au saulf menage;

Mais deinz sessante al dieu servage

Pour reclamer câest tout en vein
2130

Un fol pecchant. He, queu vilein!

Quant par precher du chapelein,

Ne pour fieblesce de son age,

Ne reconoist son sov
er
ein;

Ainz plus se fait de dieu loig
n
tein

Que ne fait beste en le boscage.

Lâorguil de lâInobedient

En ceste siecle auci sovent

Fait guerre sourdre et grant distance;

Dont la maldiont mainte gent,
2140

Et dieus la maldist ensement.

Ce duissont savoir cils du France,

Que dieus hiet la desobeissance,

De ce qâencontre leur ligance

Chascun par guerre se defent

De faire hom
m
age et obeissance

A celluy qui de sa nescance

Le droit depar sa mere prent.

Dame Orguil trop sâentente mist,

Quant ceste file ensi norrist,
2150

Baillant a luy deux servitours,

Dont ly primer ad no
u
n Despit,

Qui curtoisie sanz respit

Guerroie et dist maintes folours:

Lâautre est Desdaign, qâen toutez courtz

Parole et fait tout a rebours,

Nâagarde a ce que Reso
u
n dist.

Dame Orguil, lâaisnÃ© des sorours,

Ces deux servantz pour leur erro
ur
s

Avoec sa file les assist.
2160

Despit la sert en son degrÃ©,

Que ja ne souffre de bon grÃ©

Que lâen luy don
n
e aucune aprise;

Ne combien quâil en soit priÃ©
55

En sa science ou facultÃ©

Dâenseigner autre, en nulle guise

Ne voet ce faire, ainz le despise:

Qâa son avis lâautry franchise

Luy est servage abandon
n
Ã©;

Et pour cela de sa mesprise
2170

Le pris de son voisin desprise,

Au fin quâil mesmes soit prisÃ©.

Asses trovons dâessamplerie

Qâen despiser ad grant folie,

Et molt sovent mal en avient:
56

Ce parust bien du feel Golie,

Quant despisoit de sâestoutie

David, qâa sa bataille vient;

Mais dieu, qui tout crea du nient,

Pour lâorguil qui son cuer retient
2180

Fist tant quâil en perdist la vie.
57

Au despitous despit avient,

Car mort soubite luy survient

Du p
er
manable vilenie.

âWay,â ce dist IsaÃ¯e, âa vous,

Qâas autres estes despitous!

Car quant vous serrez enlassÃ©

A despire autrez, lors de tous

Serretz despitâ; dont entre nous

Falt bien que soions avisÃ©.
2190

Ce dist David en son decrÃ©e:

âLy toutpuissant deinz son pensÃ©e

Despise tous les orguillous,â

Et tout le mond les tient en hÃ©e:

Drois est pour ce que malurÃ©

Soiont aveoc les malurous.

Par MoÃ¿sen dieus a sa gent

Dist, que sâils son com
m
andement

Vorront despire, lors en vain

Les champs font semer du frume
n
t,

Ou planter vine aucunement;
2201

Car dieus trestout le fruit et grain

Leur fra tollir au forte main;

Ils gaigneront sanz avoir gain,

Et viveront sanz vivement.

He fol orguil, qui tols le pain,

Trop es au p
ro
pre corps vilain,

Et tâalme nul p
ro
ufit en prent.
58

Par Ezechiel dieu disoit,

A cause que son poeple erroit
2210

[Pg 29]

Ses covenances despisant,

Tieux reetz dist quâil extenderoit,

Dont pris trestous attrapperoit

En tieu priso
u
n, que puis avant

Nuls leur puet estre rechatant,

Ainz y morront sanz nul garant.

Vei la le fin qâavenir doit

Au despitous desobeissant;

Car cil qâau dieu nâest obeissant

Au deable obeiera par droit.
2220

Roy Salomon de son aprise

Dist, cil qui povre gent despise

Reproeche fait au creatour.

Et Malachie en tiele guise

Demande, puisq
ue
dâune assise

Un dieus de tous estoit fesour,

Pour quoy la dame ou le seigno
ur

Despiseront la gent menour,

Que de nature et de franchise

Ont alme et corps semblable a lour.

A ce demande, O despisour,
2231

Tu dois respondre a grant Juise.

Despit, qui porte cuer inflat

Du vent dâorguil, dont il abat

Humblesce par desobeissance,

Ne fait honour a nul estat,

Nâau duc, nâau conte, nâau prelat,

Ne voet soutz lâautry governance

Servir, mais par contrariance

Du dit, du fait, du contenance
2240

DesobeÃ¯t du cuer elat.

Gregoire en porte tesmoignance,
59

Que cuer enflÃ© de tiele estance

Au toute veritÃ© debat.

Despit, qui sert Delacio

De lâestom

Du quelle par temptacio

2250

Dâun malvois ny sâest evolant,

Et au peiour sâest retornant,

Qâest fait a sa dampnacio

Deinz la puante goule ardant

De Sathan, u mort est vivant

Dâeterne lamentacio

Desdaign, qua

Dessur les povres gens menuz;

Et si nul povre le salue,
2260

Il passe avant com

f. 17

Que ne respont a leur saluz:

Et sâom ne dist le bien venuz,

Lors son orguil luy monte sus,

Que lâen nâagarde a sa venue;

Sicom

Rampant sâen vait col estenduz,

Com

Desdeign des autrez se desdeigne,

Come lâescripture nous enseigne;
2270

Sicome Judas se desdeignoit

Du bienfait de la Magdeleine,

Qua

Dont de Jh

Un archeprestre auci estoit,

Quant lâom

Au jour de Sabat garisoit:

Lâun contre dieu desdeign portoit,

Et lâautre contre sa p

2280

Ce nous dist Salomon le sage,

Que cil qui plus deinz son corage

Est dâindignacio
u
n prochein,

Cil est plus pres dâestre en servage
60

As autres vices; car lâoutrage,

Que gist el vice de desdeign,

Tant fait le cuer gross et vilein,

Quâil nâest egal vers son p

Ne soubgit vers son seignorage;

Tout obeissance tient en vein,
2290

DâumilitÃ© se tient forein

Dâorguil en le plus halt estage.
61

De celle generacio

[Pg 30]

Roy Salomon de son aprise;

Et le p

2300

Ainz dist en reprobacio

Que dieus les oels de halte enprise

Humilera de sa reprise

En la basse obscuracio

Mais dâautre part Danger auci,

Qui du Franchise est anemy,

A ceste route associa

Dame Orguil pour servir ensi,

Que jam
m

De son bon grÃ© nâobeiera.
2310

Unques Danger fuist ne serra

AmÃ©, quâil unques nul ama,

Car Groucer, ly vilain failly,

De son consail toutdis esta:

Qui plus vers luy sâumilera,

Plus trovera contraire en luy.

Orguil, qui tous biens desordeigne

Et trestous mals au point ordeigne,

Trois autres sers fist ordeigner,

Queux Inobedience meine
2320

Chascune jour de la semeigne

Pour luy servir et consailler.

Murmur hom fait lâun appeller,

Et lâautre, qâest trop adverser,

Rebellion, qui dieu desdeigne;

Contumacie oÃ¯ nom

Le tierce, qui sâumilier

Ne voet pour nul amour ne peine.

Pour Murmur et Rebellio
u

Dieus se venga, car nous lison
2330

Que les Hebreus, quâil ot menÃ©

Hors du servage a Pharaon,

En la deserte regio
u

Trestous occit pour ce pecchÃ©;

Qâun soul de tous en salvetÃ©,

Fors soul Caleph et JosuÃ©,

En terre du p

Ne pot venir; car sanz pitÃ©

Dieu, qui vist leur rebelletÃ©,

Les ot mis a perdicio
u
n.
2340

La terre en soy se desferma,

Et en abisme transgluta

Dithan et Abiron vivant;

Et puis du ciel dieus envoia

La flam

ChorÃ© ove tout le remenant,

Qâa luy sâestoiont adherdant:

Que cils furont ly plus puissant
62

De les Hebreus, mais pourcela

Quâils deinz soy furont murm

2350

Dieus se venga, que plus avant

Les autres par ce chastia.

A SaÃ¼l dieus disoit ce point,

Que dâaguillo
u

Câest dure chose a regibber:

Mais Orguil ne sâen garde point,

Combien quâil soit constraint et point

De dieu, pour ce ne veot lesser

Encontre dieu de rebeller:

Car il ad un son consailler,
2360

Que jam

Contumacie lâoi nom

Qâau tout p

Cil fait encontre tout a point.

Contumacie se refiere

As trois parties: la primere

A mesmes dieu fait sa mesprise,

Et la seconde au piere et miere,

Et lâune et lâautre est trop amiere;

La tierce au gent du sainte eglise,
2370

Qâa leur somonce et leur aprise

Ne sâobeÃ¯t, ainz les despise,

Et leur sentence met derere.

De ces trois pointz, dont je devise,
63

Dieus se corouce en mainte guise,

Et prent vengance horrible et fiere.

Seron le Prince de Surrie

Cil vint en sa contumacie

A rebeller encontre dieu,

Com
m

2380

Si volt combatre en sâestultie

Ove bon Judas le Machabieu;

Mais au p

Antiochus aussi refu,

Qâa dieu dâorguil se contralie,

Dont puis fuist mort et confundu.

Orguil du prince en la chaiere,

Et plus se vante et sâesjoÃ¿t,

Tant plus le tient dieus en despit

Et le tresbuche a sa misere.

Orguil p

Qe les plus sages elle affole,
70

Quant a sa part les poet attraire:

Orguil qant moustre sa parole,

Ne voet souffrir qâom reparole

Du chose que luy soit contraire:
2490

Orguil sovent se veste en haire

Devant les gens en saintuaire,

Et par soy meine vie mole:

Orguil soulein tout quide a faire;

Dont ne requiert dâascun affaire

Orguil vantparle en toute assisse,

Et quiert quâil soit primer assisse,

Car Orguil plest en nul office,

Ainz loigns des tous biens p

Orguil est celle enfermetÃ©e,

Que le triacle de sauntÃ©e,

Qâom fait de vertu et doctrine,

Torne en poison envenimÃ©.

Au frenesie est comparÃ©e,

Que tolt la reso

Trestout au deable soit alÃ©.

Sur tous pecchÃ©s pour acompter

Orguil fait plus a redoubter

De sa tresfiere vassellage;

Car câest des vices le primer,

Qâassalt et fiert le chivaler,

Et le darrein a son passage.

He, halt Orguil du bass estage,

Ly sages dist que dieus le sÃ©e

Et en leur lieu seoir y fist

âSi je suy sire, u est lâonour,

Si je suy piere, u est lâamour,

Que lâen me doit et don

Responde, Orguil, di la verrour;
2590

Tu lâas tollu de ton errour,

Dont reson est qâil tâen chastie.

He, Orguil, fole capiteine

Des vices et la primereine,

De jadis te fay remembrer;

Encore car sur toy lâenseigne

Encontre dieu vols attempter.

Soit reputÃ© de luy plus bele,

Ou plus de luy faitice soit,

Ly cuers dâenvie tant enboit,

Que tout entrouble la cervele;

Itiel Dolour au court du Roy

Quant voit qâuns autres serra sire,

Qâau paine poet ces houres dire.

Trop est tiel orguil a despire,

Et nepourquant tout tiele entente

En gen

Quant presde luy voit avancer,

Ou soit parent ou soit parente;

Car il perdroit sa p

Pour lâautry faire damager.

Car pour prier ne pour don

A lâautry p

Et sa dolour maine a rebroy

De ce quâil voit bienfaire autry.

De tiel dolour David prioit,

Que sur le chief revertiroit

Quant ceste fille est courteour,

Et voit ceaux de la court maiour

Et p

Siq

Si ceste fille en son mestier

Et com

Par tout yceste est enviouse,

Mais quant elle est religiouse,

Tant plus dâardante envie boit,

Et plus se fait lÃ©e et joyouse,

Quant voit la fame ruinouse

De son confrere, quelquâil soit;

Voir si ce fuist de saint Benoit,

Et il en pure vie estoit,
3200

Encore la maliciouse,

Si mal de luy parler orroit,

Dedeinz son cuer sâesjoyeroit.

Vei la la fille perillouse!

Ensur les autrez soers dâEnvie

A ceste soer plus est amye

Detraccio

Que molt sovent par compaignie

De Malebouche sa norrie

Fait envers luy sa messagiere:
3210

Le mal dâautry lâune a derere
89

Reconte, et lâautre la matiere

Ascoulte du joyouse oÃ¯e;

Car dâautry p

f. 22

Si quide avoir celle adversiere

Honour del autry vilanie.

Tout va le mond a son desir,

Quant Malebouche poet oÃ¯r,

De ses voisins qâest desfamant:

De son mesdit, de son mentir
3220

Du rire ne se poet tenir,

Tant sâen delite en ascultant.

Pour ce qâest mesmes forsvoiant,

Vorroit que tous de son semblant

Fuissent malvois; pour ce cherir

Fait Malebouche en son contant,

Que lâautri vices met avant,

Et les vertus fait resortir.

Câil qâest de ceste fille apris,

Trop est du fole envie apris;
3230

Car il se souffre de son grÃ©

Du p

Par si qâun autre en ait le pis:

Sicome dâun hom

Trop fuist ce loign du charitÃ©,

Quant ensi fuist le jeu p

Au tiele gent, ce dist ly sages,

Quâils ont leur joye des damages

Dont voient leur veisin grever;

Et dâautre part deinz leur corages,

Quant ils font mesmes les oult

De mesfaire ou de mesparler,

En ce se faisont deliter.

Par quoy David en son psalter

Se plaignt des tieles rigolages,

Et dist, âSi je de mon sentier

Ezechiel prophetiza

As filz Amon disant cela,

Que pour ce quâils joyous estoiont

Sur le meschief as fils Juda,

Dieus dâorient envoiera

Les gens qui leur destruieroiont

Si nettement, q

Que puis memoire nâen serra:
3261

Pour ce fols sont qui se rejoyont

Sur lâautry mal, et point ne voiont

Le mal qui puis leur avendra.

As ses disciples par un jour

Dieus dist, qâen leur tristesce et plour

Ly mondes sâesleÃ«scera.

Câestoit parole dur a lour,

Mais il dist puis, q
ue
leur tristour

En joye au fin revertira;
3270

Et cil qui de leur doel pieÃ§a

Se fist joyous, dolent serra,

Quant la tenebre exteriour

Soudainement luy surprendra,

U joye aucune ne verra,

Ainz infinit sont ly dolour.

Ce dist ly sage en general:

Quiconq

Serra du mal au fin notÃ©

Et puny par especial
3280

Du vengement judicial:

Car qui du mal font leur risÃ©e,

Leur lieu et paine est ordeinÃ©

En lâinfernale oscuretÃ©,

Com
m

U que ly dent sont grundillÃ©

Et plour est indeterminÃ©,

Sanz nul espoir memorial.

La quarte file dâEnvie, qâest dite Supplantacio

La quarte fille par droit no

Est dite Supplantacio
u

3290

Qâaprent dâEnvie son mestier,

De controver occasio

Par faulse mediacio

Coment les gens doit supplanter,

Ou par priere ou par don

Car pour soy mesmes avancer,

Nâen voet aucun esp

Que ne luy fait desavancer,

Ou soit ce lai ou soit clergo

3300

Car quiq

Du terre ou du quiconq

Et en bargaign mesure tent,

Quant Supplant le porra savoir,

Tantost ferra tout son povoir

A destourber que lâautre enprent,

Et sur ce moult plus largement

Ferra son offre au paiement,

Pour lâautri faire removoir

De son bargaign; car voirement

Dont son voisin doit meinz valoir.

Mais quant Supplant en co

De luy en bon

Curtois devient et liberal,

Si don

Et vait au seignour blandisant,

Et entre ce vait compassant

Le mal dâautry, jusques atant
3320

Quâil pourra tenir au final

Ce que ly autres tint devant:

Ensi son p

Fait son voisin ruer aval.

Mais sâen la seculere guise

Supplant se queinte et se desguise

Dâenvie entre la laie gent,

Asses plus met de sa queintise

En ceaux qui sont de sainte eglise.

Qui garde au court de Rome en prent,

La poet om au com

Et puis avant com

[Pg 42]

Mais au meschant qui pov

Quant il nâad quoy dont supplant

3340

Et dâautre part se tournera;

Câest envers ceaux qui pier a pier

Richesce, honour, sens et poer;

Car de nature regnera

U plus des biens voit habonder:

Com

Tant plus Supplant lâenviera.

Supplant dâenvie trop se ploie

As p

3350

Si quâils soiont de sa partie;

Sovent leur don

Et plus promet, et beal lo

Ensi par sa procuracie,

Par son deceipte et par veisdye,

Et par despense du monoye

Dont sâesjoÃ¿t du faulse envie,

Qant voit son prou q

Ce dist Tulles en lâescripture,

Que mort, dolour, nâautre lesure

Nâest tant contraire a no nature

Mais quâil soit mesmes avancÃ©s;

Pour ce se ploie de tous lÃ©es,

Dont en honour soit eshalciez
3380

De ce qâun autre ert escharny:

Mais Aristole en ses decrÃ©s

Câest un des tous le plus failly.

Supplant endroit de sa vertu

Bien fait du Jacob EsaÃ¼,

Car câest droitz qâautry ruera

3420

De Circumvencio

Car qua

Ils ont malice tost confite

Du fals compass, dont sanz merite

Ils lâen ferront paine et damage.

Confusio

Qui sert Supplanteme

Car cil ne laist jusqâen la fin,

Tant com

Il suit come bercelet au sein,

Pour luy ruer a son declin.

Ja nuls serra si bon cristin,

Qui mors ne soit de ce mastin,
3440

Si dieus ne soit de luy gardein.

Mais qâensi confont son voisin,

Doit bien savoir q

tiel engin

Serra puny come du vilein.

Confusion, dist Jeremie,

Est de si grande felonie,

Qâil les labours du piere et miere,

Les berbis ove la vacherie,

Trestout du malvois dent dâenvie

Runge et mangut, q

3450

Nâest chose quâil laist a derere,

AinÃ§ois devoure et filz et frere

Ove tout cele autre p

Car tant ad sa malice fiere,

Nâest tant prodhom

Quâil ne tresbusche en ceste vie.

Mais en le livre au sage truis,

Quâun tiels malvois serra destruis;

Quâil est escript que peccheour,

Qui tient supplantement en us,
3460

Par double voie ert confondus

Du supplant a son darrein jour:

Car Mort supplantera sâonour

Du siecle, dont fuist supplantour,

Et puis serra du ciel exclus

Pour son pecchÃ© du fol errour:

Si lâun est mal, lâautre est peiour,

Car doublement serra confus.

La quinte file dâEnvie, qâest dite Fals semblant.

DâEnvie encore une enviouse,

La quinte file plus grevouse,
3470

Naist, et le noun du Fals semblant
95

Enporte, et est si perillouse,

Si trescoverte et enginouse,

Que quant trestout le remenant

Des files, dont jâay dit devant,

Quâelle ait tout fait la venimouse.
3480

Cil qâest du Fals semblant norry,

Plus asprement deÃ§oit celuy

Vers qui plus porte compaignie;

Car come plus fait semblant dâamy

Quâil ad covert sa tricherie.

Qui ceste file meine et guie,

Pour ce quâil plest a dame Envie,

Est sur les autres estably

De qui deceipte et felonie

Du Fals semblant la bele chere

Odibles est et semble chiere;

Du bien parole en mal pensant,

La chose doulce fait amere,

Lâavant fait tourner en derere,

Si fait le blanc en noir muant:

Trop est son oignt au fin poigna

Du venym mordt en son baisant,

Et en plourant rit la trichere.

Ostour en penne de phesant,

Ne poet faillir en mal fesant

Que sa malice au fin ne piere.

Ce dist Tulles, quâil nâest dolour

Dâaucun tort fait, qui soit peiour,

Com

Par coverture interiour,

Et par semblant exteriour

Du bon amour fait apparence.
3510

[Pg 44]

Ce parust bien dâexperience,

Quant Judas fist la rev

Baisant la bouche al salveour;

Câestoit dâamour bon

Ly semblant fuist dâun autre tour.

Pour Fals semblant a droit servir,

Sa miere Envie ad fait venir

Bilingues, qâad en une teste

Deux langues pour les gens trahir.
3520

Nâest qui sâen poet contretenir,

Tant ad coverte sa tempeste;

Car dâune langue piert honeste

Al oill, que tout du joye et feste

Parolt, mais lâautre en soy tapir

Fait sa malice deshoneste,

Dont plus qâescorpio
u

Fait sa pointure au fin sentir.

Du double langue la parole

Trop semble debonaire et mole;
3530

Mais tant est dur, ce dist ly sage,

Que tresp

Au cuer, dont maint p

AinÃ§ois quâils scievont son langage.

Ses ris qâom voit du lÃ©e visage

Sont mixt de doel deinz le corage,

Dont puis les innocens tribole:

A celle urtie qâest salvage

Resemble, que gist en lâombrage

MuscÃ©e dessoutz la primerole.
3540

Plus q

Ove lâaiguilo

Du tiel venym le fait confire,
3550

Que nul triacle poet suffire

Ce dist Sidrac, que doulcement

Quant faire en voet deceivement,

Quant lâen meulx quide avoir hono

De sa parole plus y ment.

Du Fals semblant om poet escrire,

Quâil est semblable pour descrire

Au Mirre, q

Car lâen ne trove en nul empire

Racine, gum

Que dâamertume soit peiour:

Ensi du traitre losengour

Molt sont plesant au dame et sire

Luy fait convertont en dolour,

Dont p

Qui les oisealx deÃ§oit et prent

Moult les frestelle gaiement,

Dont en ses reetz les porra traire;

Et ensi ly bilingues tent

He, vice al oill tant debon

Tu as du joye le viaire,

Et le penser come mort dolent:

Tu es la reule de contraire,

Le beau solail qâen toy sâesclaire

Par toy sâesclipse trop sovent.

Ly sages dist q

En celluy, qui par sophistrie

Car tiel a dieu ne plerra mie,

Mais double lange, atant vous dy,

Qâest ce que lâen pourra don

Si dist qâom le doit resembler

Et puis le fait ap

Uns clers dâEnvie ensi com

3710

Que plus resemble a son fals piere:

Car nuyt ne jour son cuer nâalente

Sur lâautry mal, ainz atalente

Tout autry bien mettre a derere:
102

Câest du malice la marchiere;

Câest le challou deinz la perriere,
103

Qui porte fieu deinz son entente;

Câest le rasour qui nous fait rere

La barbe contre poil arere,

Que jusqâal oss prent sa descente:
3720

Câest celle urtie mal poignant,

Que dâamertume vait bruillant

La rose qui luy est voisine;

Câest ly serpens toutdis veillant,

Qâen lâille Colcos fuist gardant

Le toison dâorr, dont par covine,

Qâen fist Medea la meschine,

3730

He, false Envie malvoisine,

Com

Envie est cil dragon mortiel,

Ove qui lâarchangre seint Michel,

Et luy ruoit del halte assisse

Au Basilisque en sa figure;

Qâest uns serpens espoentable,

Qâestaignt et tolt de sa nature

Du fuil et herbe la verdure:

En tous les lieus u quâil demure

Ensi dâEnvie la sufflure,

Honour, bontÃ©, sen et mesure

De ses voisins fait descheable.

Envie par especial

Sur tous mals est desnatural,

Car si trestout ussetz don

Et corps et biens en general
3760

A lâenvious, cil au final

Du mal tâara reguerdon

He, envious cuer malurÃ©,

Ne scies com

Mais no

Et bouche de detraccio

Ove piÃ© de diffamacio

Nâest pas sanz vice qâad ces trois.

Ly mons Ethna, quele art toutdiz,

Nulle autre chose du paiis

107

A ce sâacorde en son savoir
3810

Ly philesophre, et dist pour voir

Qâenvie asses plus fait doloir

Son portour, qui la tient saisis,

Que lâautre contre qui movoir

La sente, et lâautre en est guaris.
108

Au maladie qâest nom

Câest un desnaturel ardour,

Que deinz le corps u sâest entrÃ©
3820

De son chalour demesurÃ©

Arst com

Dont ensechist du jour en jour

Le cuer ove tout lâinteriour,

Que dieus en lâalme avoit posÃ©;

Siquâil nây laist du bon amour

Neis une goute de liquour,

Dont charitÃ© soit arousÃ©e.

Envie ensur tout autre vice

Est la plus vaine et la plus nice:
3830

Sicom
m

Envie est celle peccatrice,

Qes nobles courtz de son office

Demoert et est com
m

A les plus sages plus despute,
109

A les plus fortz plus fait salute,
110

Et as plus riches dâavarice

Plus fait Envie sa poursute:

A son povoir sovent transmute

Lâonour dâautry de sa malice.
3840

Uns clers en son escript difine

Disant: âNâest cil qui tant encline

Au deable sicom

La quelle a sa primere orine

En paradis fist la ruine,

Dont abeissa la n

He, quel aguait, quele envaÃ¯e

Nous faisoit lors de sa boidie,

Qâelle ot muscÃ© deinz sa peytrine!

Et ore nâest ce point faillie;
3850

En tous paiÃ¯s la gent escrie

Que trop endure sa covine.

De les cink files de Ire, des queles la primere ad

Si plus avant vous doie dire

Des filles qui se naiscont dâIre,
[Pg 48]

Cynk en y ad trop malurÃ©s,
111

Lâune est malvoise et lâautre est pire:

U que se serront mariÃ©s:

Car plus p

En fais, en dis, et en pensÃ©s,
3860

Que nulle langue poet descrire.

Ont sur tous autres desfiÃ©s,

Et plus les faisont a despire.

La primere est Malencolie,

Câest une file trop hastie,

Que se corouce du legier

Pour un soul mot, si nuls le die,

Voir dâune paile ou dâune mye

Se vorra malencolier.
3870

Cil qui le voet acompaigner,

O tout laisser sa compaignie:

Ne valt reso

Car lâire sourt deinz son penser

Com

Quant ceste fille prent seignour,

Tant meinz avra son bon amo

Malencolie en ire flote

Et de discort tient la riote;
3890

Car pour le temps q
ue
lâire dure

Ne luy plerra chanÃ§on ne note:

Si tu bien dis, le mal en note,

Si tu voes chald, il voet freidure,

Quant tu te hastes, il demure,

Ore est dessoutz, ore est dessure,

Ore hiet et ore dâamour assote,

Ore voet, no

Plus est movable de nature

Que nâest la chace du pelote.
3900

Malencolie en son bourdant

Se melle ensi com

Car ire et jeu tient tout dâun pris:

Quiq

Sâil poet venir a son devant,

Il fait a son povoir le pis.

Ne sont pas sanz corous ses ris,

Non sont sanz maltalent ses dis,

Petit dura son beau semblant;

Si rien vait contre son devis,
3910

Sovent enbronchera le vis;

Plus est divers que nul enfant.

4340

Ainz nuyt et jour sur ce conspire,

Jusques atant que la ruine

Qâom poet apres aucunement

En tiel lieu estre seurement

U pardevant estoit en hÃ©e.

Qui contre Hange riens mesfait,

Si tost nâen poet venger le fait,

En coy retient ses maltalens,

De son rancour semblant ne fait,

Mais il engorge le forsfait

Tout pres du cuer deinz son po

Dont pour priere de les gens,

AinÃ§ois quâil voit venir le temps

Qâil p

Hange est bien semblable au Camele,

Qua

Ou autrepart dont ad lesure,

Tout coy le souffre et le concelle;
4420

Mais soit certain ou cil ou celle

Qui lâad batu, quant verra lâure,

Soudainement par aventure

Ou mort ou fiert de sa nature,

Du quoy revenge sa querelle.

Du malvois hom

Car par si faite coverture,

Qua

Mais Hange qâensi le ferra

Car combien quâil son maltalent,

4620

HaÃ¿ne en fÃ©e com

Est dâIre celle chamberleine

Que nuyt et jour ove luy conv

HaÃ¿ne est celle buiste pleine

Du venym, dont chascun se pleigne

Par tout u lâen lâespant ou verse:

HaÃ¿ne est celle horrible herce,

Que deinz son cuer tue et enherce

Et son p

Si est la pestilence adverse,
4630

Que trop soudainement reverse

La vie que lâen tient plus seine.

La quarte file de Ire, qâest appellÃ©e Contek.

La quarte file qâest irouse

P

Que de sa lange point nâestrive,

Les jangles du litigiouse

Ne quiert, ainz quant est corouÃ§ouse,

Tantost pour soy venger sâavive,

Et en devient tantost hastive;

Dont son coutell maltalentive

Y trait et fiert maliciouse,

Qâa lors nâesp

De nulle reso

Tant a combatre est coragouse.

Et pour cela, ce mâest avis,

Son no

Contek, tout plain de baterie.

Quiconq

Tant ad le cuer dâirrour espris,

Que pacience ad forsbanie.
4650

Car quant Contek le poeple guie,

Tous se pleignont de sa folie

Par les CitÃ©s, par les paiis;

Mais riens ly chalt qui plourt ou crie,

AinÃ§ois quiert avoir la mestrie,

Dont son barat soit acomplis.

Quant Hange, qâest sa soer germeine,

Et nâose mesmes soy venger,

Au Contek vient et si sâen pleigne,

Et luy p

Pour lâautry teste debriser:

Prest est Contek pour son loer

Si prent les do

Et quant celuy poet encontrer,

Les gens du pees sont en freour

Par Contek et par son destour;

Et maintesfois avient issi,

Que sans hanap ly Conteckour

Quâil verser vorroit a lâautri;

Le mal sovent rechiet sur luy,

Le quel vers autres ad basti,

Et de folie la folour

Molt plus soudeinement le blesce
133

Que ne fait fouldre p

Quant vient du sodeine avent

Car Folhastif de sa nature

De nul peril voit la destresce,

Ainz tout par rage le court sure,
4750

Tanquâil ait fait sa demesure,

Ou soit desfait, car lâun ne lesse.

Et pour cela dist YsaÃ¯e

Qâom doit fuÃ¯r la compaignie

De lâom

En ses narils, car sa folie

Grieve a celluy qui lâassocie.

Et Salomon auci te dit,

Qâove folhardy pour nul excit

4760

Il te metra la jupartie,

Dont tu serres en malvois plit;

Quâil ad le cuer si mal confit,

Ly folhastif son fol appell

A poursuÃ¯r pour nul reppell

Ne voet lesser a tort nâa droit;

Dont molt sovent tout le meinz bel

Luy vient, come fist a Asahel,

Qui frere de Joab estoit,
4770

Apres Abner quant poursuioit,

Qui bone pees luy demandoit,

Mais lâautre qâestoit fol et feel

En son corous tant le hastoit,

Qâen haste qua

Sur luy reverti le flaiell.

Mais au final si me refiere

Au fol Contek, qui piere et miere

De sa main fole et violente

Blesce ou mehaigne, trop est fiere
4780

Et trop p

Qâau tiel oultrage se consente,

Cil nâest pas digne a mon entente

De vivre ensi come la jumente,

Ne tant come chiens de sa man

Nature, mais en sa jovente

Lâom

La quinte file de Ire, qâest appellÃ© Homicide.

De ceste file je ne say

Com

4790

Ma langue a ce ne me souffist:

Car soulement quant penseray

Du grant hisdour, ensi mâesmay

Que tout mon cuer de ce fremist.

La nuyt primere quant nasquist,

Ly deable y vint et la norrist

Du lait mortiel, si chanta way,

En berces u la fole gist,

Et Homicide a no

Qâest trop horrible a tout essay.
4800

Cil qâest a ceste file dru,

PrivÃ© serra de Belsabu

Et de lâenfern chief citezein;

Car il met toute sa vertu,

Que par ses mains soit espandu

Sicome du porc le sanc humein.

Du false guerre est capitein,

Dont maint p

Par luy sont mort et confondu,

Car câest sa joye soverein:
4810

[Pg 59]

Quant poet tuer du p

Jam

Fol Homicide en sa partie

Ne voet ferir maisquâil occie

La povre gent no

Ne pour mercy q

Laisser ne voet sa felon

Car dâautry mort nâest m

He, vice trop abhominable,

Horrible, laide, espoentable,
4820

En qui pitÃ©s est forsbanie,

Dont mort eterne et p

Tâaguaite ove paine lamentable

Del infernale deverie!

Fol Homicide en sa contrÃ©e

Pour poy du riens, quant est irrÃ©,

Ne chalt de son voisin tuer;

Ainz dist que tout est bien alÃ©,

Sâil poet fuÃ¯r en salvetÃ©

Ou a chapelle ou a mouster;

Ainz est pour soy deliverer,

Fume et vapour sâen vont issant;

Et tout ensi ce dist ly sage,

U qâomicide vient suiant,
4840

Manace doit venir devant

Come son bedell et son message.

Terrour, Freour a son menage

Vienont ove luy, q

Des innocens vont despuillant;

Que si lâen nâeust pl

As simples gens trop fait oult

Cil qâensi les vait manaÃ§ant.

Car quant Manace y est venu,

As simples cuers trop est cremu,
4850

Voir plus que fouldre ne tonaire:

Du soun qâest de sa bouche issu

Quant les orailles sont feru,

Jusques au cuer descent lâesclaire.

Qâau dieu ne poet Manace plaire

Nous en trovons bon essamplaire
135

De les manaces Eseau,

Qant dist quâil voit Jacob desfaire:

Dieu le haoit de tiel affaire

Et a Rebecke en ad desplu.
136

4860

Mais lâOmicide ad un servant

Qâest dâautre fourme mesfaisant

Trop p

Car nâose ap

Pour ce sicome ly desloyals

Envers le mond se voet celer,

Mais ja pour dieu ne voet lesser,
4880

Qui tout survoit et monts et vals:

Mais sache bien cil adverser,

Quant dieus vendra po

Tout serront overt ses consals.

He, Moerdre du male aventure,

Qâoccit encontre sa nature

Sans avoir mercy ne pitÃ©!

Dont dieus, qui tout voit p

De luy qui fiert ensi celÃ©,
4890

Que ja du sanc nâest saoulÃ©.

Mais sache bien cil malurÃ©,

Vengance crie a dampnedÃ©e,

Dont trop poet estre espoentÃ©

Qui sâad mis en tiel aventure.
[Pg 60]

Si furont mort tout maintenant:

Que dieus Moerdrer unq

Mais sicome dieus le vait disant,

Au fin dâespeie perira.

Quant ce q

Ascune est yvre et en dormant

Au plain nul poet conter le mal

Que dâOmicide en general

Car ce qâelle en especial

A son poair du mort exteint,

Que par son vuill petit remeint:

El viele loy du poeple hebreu,

Si lâun avoit lâautre feru

De son voloir quâil ad eeu

Pour homicide il fuist tenu,

Dont lâen le firont forsjuger

Et si lâeust occis au plener,

Que morir ne lâestoet au fin,

Car mesme dieu ce com

De son autier le plus divin,

Et qâom son sanc espandera

Qui dâautri sanc se fist sanguin.

Trop fist Achab a dieu destance,

Quant il Naboth par lâordinance

De Jesabell au mort conspire;

Car dieus de mesme la balance

De lâun et lâautre prist vengance:

Et dâautrep

Coment Nathan du n

Quâil nâert pas digne au dieu plesa

Qâil ot fait faire Urie occire

Pour BersabÃ© fole aquointance.

ChaÃ¿m son frere Abel occit,

Et pour cela dieus le maldit

Câest CrualtÃ©, qâest sans mercy,

Qâaprist Herodes lâessamplaire,

Mais dieus se venga puis de luy.

Asses des autres sont auci,

Des queux hom poet essample traire,

Car dieus nâad pitÃ© de celuy

Dont sur vengance vengement

Du mort que jam

Ezechiel p

Mais fol nâen pense au p

Car pour ton corps poindre et bruiller

Molt est cel hom

Le corps et alme fait grever:

Car lâun ainÃ§ois fait periler

Que lâure vient de terminer

La vie qâest ennaturÃ©e;

Et lâautre fait desheriter

Du ciel, u peas enheriter

He, Ire, ove ta cruele geste,

Et en tous lieux la malvenue;

Car dieus ove qanq

Ce dist uns clercs, et le diffine,

Du cruele Ire qui ne fine,

Du quoy nature en soi se pleignt,

Qâelle est semblable en sa covine

Au prime ou tierce qant sâesveile,

Si lors se lieve câest merveille;

Car son deblet qui lâad en cure

Tout suef cornant dedeinz lâoreille

En mainte guise le conseille,

Si dist, âAtten jusqus al hure

Que satisfait a ta nature:

Eietz si preu ta norreture,

Car câest la chose, je te jure,

Que longue vie tâappareille.â
5220

Mais quant pour loer deservir

Au sompnolent estoet servir,

Et qâau matin son mestre appelle,

âOre Ã§a vien tost!â he, quel suspir,

He, quel dolour, quant doit partir

Hors du chalour de sa lincelle!

Dont au chaucier de sa braielle

Enmy dormant fait sa querelle,

Quâil plus au plain ne poet dormir.

Qâad tiel varlet ou tiele ancelle,

Ly Sompnolent sicome lâenfant

Quiert estre deinz son lit couchant,

Qant pour le froid nâen voet lever;

Et fait ensi pitous semblant

A descoucher, jusques atant

Quâil poet sa chemise eschaufer:

Demy se lieve, et recoucher

Tantost se fait et lâoreiller
5240

Enbrace, et puis luy dit avant,

âDy, que me voes tu consailler,

Ou plus dormir ou descoucher?â

Vei la du deable droit servant!
[Pg 64]

Au Sompnolent trop fait moleste,

Qua

Ou a mouster ou a chapelle

A dieu prier, ainz bass la teste

Mettra tout suef sur lâeschamelle,

Et dort, et songe en sa cervelle

Quâil est au bout de la tonelle,

U quâil oÃ¯t chanter la geste

De TroÃ¿lus et de la belle

Creseide, et ensi se concelle

A dieu dây faire sa requeste.

Ly sages dist que sicome lâuiss

El livre de levitici

A Sompnolence doit entendre;

Car câest un pecchÃ© desgarni,

Qui du laron et dâanemy

Sanz resister et sanz defendre:

QâainÃ§ois qâil porra garde p

Et du petit fait sa compleinte,

Ne poet souffrir si dure enpeinte;

Mais com

Du tout labour se trait arere;

Trop est en luy nature exteinte.

Mais qua

Au frere, au moigne, ou a nonneine,

Cel ordre vait trop a rebours;

Car pour cherir la char humeine

Dormont tout suef a longe aleine,

f. 33

Et sont de leur vigile courtz.

Nâest pas bien ordinÃ© ce cours;

Car ce dist dieus, qâes roials courtz

Mais tant sont tendre ly priours,

Nâont cure a ce q

Et si luy dist, âPrens remembrance

Et du soubgit fait potestat,

Pour lâoue que luy sifflera,

Tieu messager petit valra;

Car combien qâil fort corps avra,

Du quoy le pulmon et la foie

Ove tout lâentraile tremblera:

Lachesce fait le Pelerin

Enlasser, siquâil son chemin

Car qui ne sert jusqâau p

Ainz par le juggement divin

Du tout ce qâapp

Par quoy sovent est escharni;

Car quant au fin sâest enpovri,

Senec le dist, qâa son avis

Trop sâaliene et est caitis

Du foy cil qui sa repentance

[Pg 69]

Quant du jofnesse est desfloris,

Et qâau peccher nâad sufficance;

Car câest un povre bienvuillance,

Qâa dieu lors offre la pitance

Du viele lie qâest remis,

Quâil doit fuÃ¯r la maladie,

Qâau cuer del hom

Ingratitude des seignours

Du povre gent prent les labours,

Mais ja pour tant denier ne myte

Pour ce dieus le despisera,

Car deable en soy sont autretiel.

De la richesse et vain honour,

Mais poy sont qui du fin amour

Les biens verrais sont covoitant.

Par tieus enseignes dois savoir

Car sens p

Et veritÃ© verte en no

Et bienvuillance en malvoloir;

Ou soit ce moigne ou soit reclus,

Ou frere ou nonne, tout conclus

Car deinz sa court jam

Des ceaux qui sont de sa famile.

O come fait orde tricherie

Incest du prestre portant cure

Trop p

Endroit du loy judiciale,

Quant il par sa mesaventure,

Par lâorde pecchÃ© de nature,

Corrumpt la file espiritale,

Que ce leur fait eslire et prendre

Tout la plus belle et la plus tendre,
239

Car dâautre ne sont desirantz.

Itiel Incest maint fils engendre

Dessur la femeline gendre,

Incest est fole de Nonneine,

Celle est espouse au dieu demeine,

Mais trop devient sa char salvage

Qant son corps a luxure meine,
9160

Quel jour que soit de la semeine,

Dont corrumpt le dieu mariage:

Et dâautre part trop est volage

Ly fols lecchiers qui fait folage

Du matrimoine si halteine;

Car plus dâassetz cil fait oultrage

Qui dieu espouse desparage,

Que cil qui fait de sa p

[Pg 107]

Incest auci fait son office

Qant une bon

La quelle ad chastetÃ© vouÃ©,

Mais de sa char devient si nice

Que de luxure fait le vice,

Dont elle enfreint sa chastetÃ©:

Nientmeinz ycelle nicetÃ©

Ne sai si dieus en fait justice
240

Apres la mort, car le decrÃ©

Incest encore est dâautre chiere

Entre la gent fole et lecchiere,

Quant sâassemblont les p

Ou autrement filz ove sa miere,

Ou frere au soer sâest acouplez.

Qâensi mesfont de leur charniere;

Puisqâautres fem

Tost fait les autres vicious,
9260

Queux vers luy tient associÃ©;

Tout sicom
m
e ly berbis ruignous

Corrumpt du fouc les autres tous

De sa ruignouse enfermetÃ©.

El viele loy dieus defendi

Qâentre les gens qui sont de luy

Ne soit bordell ne bordellant

Pour la luxure de nully:

Mais au jour dâuy, ne sai p
ar
qui,
242

La loy se tourne nepourquant,
9270

Et est souffert par tout avant

Que lâen bordelle maintenant.

Mais une chose je vous di,

Que ja decrÃ© dâascun vivant

Nâert par reso
u
n si avenant

Com
m
e ce que dieus ot establi.

Mais cestes jofnes pucellettes

Auci se faisont jolivettes

Pour Foldelit qâest courteour,

Vestont les cercles et les frettes,
9280

Crimile, esclaires et burettes

Et bende avoec la perle entour;

Mais qant ont mis si bel atour,

Par Foldelit font maint fol tour

En chantant a leur chanÃ§onettes,
243

Qe tout sont fait du fol amour,

Pour faire q
ue
les gens dâonour

Se treont a leur amourettes.

Quant Foldelit la jofne guie,

Sur tout desire dâestre amye
9290

A luy pour qui vait languissant;

Mais pour sa honte elle ose mie

Demander telle druerie,

Si ce ne soit par fol semblant:

Et lors reguarde en suspirant,
244

Et puis suspire en reguardant,
245

f. 54

Pour lâom
m
e traire a sa folie,

Que tant valt a bon entendant

Sicom
m
e dirroit, âVenetz avant,

Je vuill avoir ta compaignie.â
9300

Sovent ensi par sa presence

Le fol corage dâom

Qui p

Mais qua

Lors falt que lâom

Dont fiert qua

Qua
n

Du fol trover ne poet faillir;

Car tost sciet fol quoy fole pense,

Et tost se sont au consentir,
9310

Dont sovent au petit loisir

Ferront la longue dieu offense.

Mais sâil avient en telle guise

Que lâen ad guarde sur luy mise,

Dont fem

Lors falt a sercher la queintise

Que fem

Dont ses guardeins desceivera;

Mais sache bien chascuns cela,

Ja nuls si fort luy guardera
9320

Que le po

Au bon loisir ne p

Si forte chose ne serra,

Qâamour du Foldelit ne brise.

Ensi qua

La jofne, lors par toute voie

Que cuers ymaginer porroit

Celle art du fem

Dont lâom

Que tout le tourne a son endroit
9330

La fem

Tantost qâuns fols amans la voit

Ne se porra tourner en voie

Des fols regars quâil aparÃ§oit;

Si quide que la belle soit

Sur tout sa souv
er
aigne joye.

Un arcbalaste en la turelle

Est celle dame ou dam

Quelle as gens p
re

De la blanchour de sa maisselle,
9340

De sa poitrine et sa mamelle

La moustre fait, que lâen lâessaie:
[Pg 109]

Mais sur tout fait pl

246

Qant les fols cuers corrumpt et plaie

Des fols regars, dont lâom

Nâad membre dont les gens nâattraie,

Si est ly reetz dessoutz la haie,

Dont om les fols oiseals hardelle.

O dieus, com

La fem

Les gens sur luy fait assoter?

Des tantes almes qui deÃ§oit

Elle ert coupablez au bon droit

Devant dieu, car par reguarder

La volentÃ© vient de toucher,

Que valt atant deinz son penser

Com

Le pecchÃ©; et ce puiss trover

En lâevangile tesmoigner,

Sicom

9360

Mais si la fem

En foldelit, dâasses plus cure

Cil hom

Et fait desguiser sa vesture,

Et ad bien basse la ceinture,

Car tant est plain de variance
9371

Qâil quiert novelle a chescune hure.

Du foldelit tout se convoie,

Qant doit venir par celle voie

U q

Ne puet faillir, maisqâil les voie,

Que par delit son cuer nâesfroie,

Tant est suspris dâamo

Ne chalt si dames ou pucelles,

9380

Des quelles poet avoir sa proie;

Siqâil sovent deinz les ridelles

Les taste si soient fem

Câest un solas dont se rejoye.

De nulle chose guarde prent

Cil qui du foldelit esprent,

Un soul estat ja nâesparnie;

Ou soit Religiouse gent,

Ou mariez ou continent,

Ou sage ou pleine de folie,
9390

Ou soit virgine ou desflourie,

Ou soit parente, pour se mie

Ne voet laisser ce quâil enp

Ne sciet qâamour plus signefie,

Mais toutes fem

Dont puet complir son foltalent.

En chascun lieu, ou q

Quiconq

Du bien, dâonour, dâoneste vie,

Ly fols amantz a son endroit
9400

Trestout le conte tourneroit

En autres ditz de leccherie:

Et qui voet faire compaignie

Au Foldelit par janglerie,

Par quoy son grÃ© deserviroit,

Ja nâestoet autre courtoisie

Mais tout parler de puterie,

Dont plus son cuer rejoyeroit.

Mais qant au fin po

9410

Et est soutz peine amonestez

Pour soy de son pecchÃ© retraire,

Si fra, ce dist; mais qant repaire

U sont ses foles ameistÃ©s,

Tant plus assote en ses pensÃ©s

Com

Dont fait aprÃ¨s folie maire;

Combien quâil soit escoumengez,

Ses foldelitz recom

Ne lerra pour le saintuaire.
9420

Mais Foldelit, qant avenir

Ne poet a faire son desir

De celle u qâad son cuer assis,

Du fol amour lâestoet languir,

Ne puet manger, ne puet dormir,

En plour tout changera ses ris,

Com
m
e sâil estoit du tout ravis;

Lors fait les notes et les ditz,

Si fait ove ce maint fol suspir,

Dont a sa dame soit avis
9430

[Pg 110]

Qâil de sâamour soit tant suspris,

Qe sanz retour lâestoet morir.

Mais si tout ce ne poet valoir

Au fin quâil pourra son voloir

Parfaire, lors du meintenant

Il offre a don
n

Et sâil par ce ne puet avoir

De son amour le remenant,

Encore quiert il plus avant

La Maquerelle, qâest sachant
9440

Plus que ly deable a tiel devoir;

Et si luy vait trestout contant,

La quelle luy vait p
ro

Du quoy sâest mis en bon espoir.

Lâen dist ensi par envoisure,

Ce que polain prent en danture

Toute sa vie apres dura;

Ensi du jofne fem

En sa vielesce la luxure

Que de sâenfance acoustuma;
9450

Du foldelit tant com
m

La jofne se delitera

Sanz point, sanz reule et sanz mesure,

Et qant nâest qui la requerra

Pour sa vielesce, lors serra

La Maquerelle de nature.

Et ensi qant au rigolage

Pour la fieblesce du viel age

Ne peut souffire p
ro

De lors sustient par son brocage
9460

La jofne gent en leur putage

Par son malvois excitement:

Car lâart du Maquerelle aprent,

Par quoy des gens reporte et p

Du leccherie leur message;

Qâencore elle ad delitement

Pour traiter a tiel parlement,

Dont rejoÃ¿t son fol corage.

Ce veons bien q

de nature,

Quant jofne busche de verdure
9470

Ne puet ardoir primerement,

Om met du sech, et par sufflure

Tantost sâesprent tout en ardure,

Et lâun et lâautre ensemblement.

Ensi vait de la jofne gent;

Qant ne sâacordont a lâassent

Du Foldelit, lors deinz brief hure

La Maquerelle les esprent

De son malvois enticement,

Et les enflam

9480

Sicom

Tout tielement vent et bargeine

La Maquerelle les virgines,

Et les fait estre concubines

Au fol lecchour qui les asseine

Et don

Et si les fiert de celle veine,

f. 55

Qâapres des nulles medicines

9490

Om deust don

Que ce p

Et tiele y a qâen sa vielesce

Devient dâamour la sorceresse;

Dont, qant ne puet p

Les cuers dâamer met en destresce:

Mais pl

q

Quant foldelit ensi convoie;

Et qui p

De lâamour dieu loign se desvoie;
9500

Car il au primes se professe

Au deable, et puis son dieu renoie:

Vei la tresdolorouse joye,

Qâensi laist dieu pour la duesse!

Du Foldelit auci se pleint

Nature, au quelle meinte et meint

Se sont forsfait de leur folie,

Quant leur luxures out enpeint

Com

247

En la CitÃ© de Sodomie,
9510

Quelle en abisme ert assorbie.

Câest celle horrible leccherie

En quelle toute ordure meint;

Dieus et nature le desfie:

Mais plus parler nâen ose mie,

Car honte et reso

Lâen puet resembler Foldelit

Au salemandre, quelle vit
[Pg 111]

De sa nature el fieu ardant;

Ensi du fol dont vous ay dit
9520

Ly cuers toutdis sanz nul respit

Sâeschalfe et art en folpensant

Dâardour qui tout vait degastant

En ceste vie, et plus avant
248

Le corps avesques lâespirit

Enflam

Pour nulle amye ert refreidant,

Car tout amour luy est desdit.

Trop fuist du Foldelit apris

Uns philosophes de jadys,
9530

Qui Epicurus no

Car ce fuist cil qâa son avis

Disoit que ly charnels delitz

Sov

ain des autres biens estoit,

Et pour cela trestout laissoit

Les biens del alme et se don

A sa caroigne; dont toutdis

Depuis son temps assetz om voit

De ses disciples, qui toutdroit

Suiont sâescole a tiel devis.

Ensi come pert son gustement

Cil qâest malade en fiebre ague,

Qui plus desire et plus mangue

Contraire chose qui luy tue,

Quâil ne fait pain de bon frument

Ou chose dont se revertue:
9550

Ensi qui Foldelit englue

Del alme nul phisique entent.

Lâapostre par especial

Ce dist, que lâom
m

Ne puet gouster ne savourer

Viande qâest espirital:

Rois Salomon dist autre tal,

Qâen malvoise alme a demourer

Puet sapience nulle entrer,

Nâen corps soubgit a folpenser
9560

Des vices qui sont corporal

Jam

Car qui pecchÃ© voet herberger

Tout bien forselot de son hostal.

Ce dist Senec de sa science,

Que la plus grieve pestilence
249

Qâom en ce siecle puet avoir,

Câest foldelit dâincontinence,

Qant om a sa caroigne pense

Et sâalme laist a no

9570

Ce sont ly porc horrible et noir

Es queux ly deable ad son pooir,

Com
m
e lâevangile nous ensense;

Car qua
n
t ne sciet u remanoir,

Lors Foldelit matin et soir

Le herberge en sa conscience.

Dieus, qui le saint p
ro

Un mot qâest molt espoentable

Par Amos dist, com
m
e vous dirrai:

De la maiso

9580

Au leccherie acoustum
m
able,

Ce dist dieus, âJe destruierai

Le septre et tout anientirai,

Qâonour ne joye nây lerrai,

Ainz trestout bien fray descheable.â

Des tieux p

Car tu scies bien et je le say,

Que dieux dist ne puet estre fable.

Du Foldelit naist Fol desir,

Qui porte cuer du fol suspir,
9590

Ove lâoill climant du fol reguart;

La bouche ne se sciet tenir,

Que les fols ris avant venir

Ne fait; et puis enseigne lâart

Du fol toucher, du quoy sâespart

Ly fieus du leccherie et art,

Que la raiso
u

Siq
ue
la chastetÃ© sâen part,

Et lors luxure de sa part

Tout son voloir fait acomplir.
9600

As portes dâenfern vait huchant

Cil qui les fem

Saint Bede le fait tesmoigner;

Mais trop est fol qui huche atant,

Dont il les portes soit entrant:

Car tant puet hom

[Pg 112]

Qâentrer lâestoet; car ly porter

Les portes pour soy desporter

Legerement vait desfermant,

Et laist celluy qui voet entrer

Tanqâen la goule a lâadv

U piert la voie large et grant.

Du foldelit avoir solas,

Danz Tullius, com

âLuxure est vile en chascun cas,

Mais oultre trestous autrez estatz

Elle est plus vile en viele gent,â
250

Ou soit du fait ou soit dâassent;

Lâun pis et lâautre malement

Ne sâen pourront excuser pas.

Du quoy sa fole char fait nice:
9630

Dont dist Bernards q

Câest reso

Ore dirra la descripcio
u
n du Leccherie par
especial.

Je truis escript q
ue
Leccherie

A la tresorde maladie

Du lepre en trois pointz est semblable:

Le primer point ce signefie,
9640

Que lepre dâom
m
e en char purrie

Fait tache molt abhominable;

Luxure ensi qâest incurable

Fait tache en lâalme plus grevable,

Dont a null jour serra guarie:

Qâau dieu primer fuist resemblable,

Luxure, qâest desamiable,

La fait semblable au deblerie.

Lepre est auci si violente

Que lâair ove tout le vent q
ue
vente
9650

Dâencoste luy fait corrumpu:

En ce Luxure rep
re
sente;

Car p
ar
tout, u qâelle est presente,

Les gens qâa luy se sont tenu

Leur bon
n
es mours et leur vertu,

Dont lâalme serroit maintenu,

Fait destourner en mal entente,

Qâau paine se sont aparÃ§u

De leur folie, ainz sont deÃ§u

Et en vielesce et en jovente.
9660

Ly tierce point qâen lepre esta,

Câest qâelle de nature fra

Al hom
m
e avoir puante aleine;

Ensi Luxure, u que sâen va,

Plus q
ue
nuls dire le pourra

Puit en ordure trop vileine

Devant la magestÃ© halteine;

Des tous pecchÃ©s el vie humeine

Nâest un qui plus fort puera:
251

Pour ce la halte voie meine,
9670

U ly puours sanz fin remeine,

Et jam
m
ais bon odour serra.

He, Leccherie, en tout empire

Com
m
e lâen te doit p
ar
droit despire!

Car p
ar
ta flam
m
e violente,

Come deinz la bible om porra lire,

Les cink citÃ©s au grant martire

Tu feis foundrer p
ar
grief descente

f. 56

Jusqâen abisme la pulente;

U la vielesce et la jovente
9680

Par toi les faisoit dieus occire,

Qâun soul nâeschapa la to
ur
mente,

Mais Loth, qui portoit chaste entente,

Pour ce lâen guarist n

252

Du Leccherie la despite

Ly philosophes nous recite

Six pointz des queux fait a loer;

Oietz com

Primer du corps qui sâen delite

La force fait amenuser,
9690

Et lâalme apres fait occier,

La bon
n
e fame en mal to
ur
ner,
[Pg 113]

Et la richesce fait petite,

La cliere vois fait enroer,

Et les oils cliers fait avoegler:

Loenge tiele est mal confite.

He, Leccherie plain dâordure,

Ovesq

Maint cuer humein as affolÃ©;

Car qui tu tiens dessoutz ta cure,

Au paine sâil jam

Helas, tant belle chastetÃ©,

Espousaille et virginitÃ©,

As corrumpu de ta luxure,

Ou soit en fait ou en pensÃ©;

Poi truis qui se sont bien gardÃ©

Tout nettement sanz ta blemure.

He, Leccherie ove tes cink files,

Com

9710

Dont fais no frele char trahir!

Au corps plesantes sont tes guiles,

Mais as nos almes sont si viles

Que devant dieu les fait puÃ¯r.

Quoy dirray plus puant plesir?

Delit au mort, joye au suspir,

Ce sont ly bien que tu compiles.

Dieus doint qâen puissons abstenir:

Au benurÃ© se puet tenir

Qui corps par ton delit nâaviles.

Qâa celle feste estoit venue;

Car cils qui sont vrai contempliers

Pour regarder de son seignour

Tu viens, caitifs, si tâen souviens,

De la taverne au deablerie,

U plus vileins qâesragÃ© chiens

Tu as despendu tous les biens

Que dieus ot mys en ta baillie,

Au fin que lâalme meulx garnie

Ce dist Jerom, q

Mangut ou boit, plourt ou solace,

Paour toutdis le fait entendre,

Com

Un corn cornant, qui luy manace,

Et dist, âVien ton acompte rendreâ:

Du tiel paour se fist susp

11480

La jus en celle horrible place

En son vivant; si ot plus tendre

Paour qâau droit se voet tenir,

Un fois le jour se vait morir,

Et en enfern fait la descente,

Cils font la paine violente,

Mais sur trestout, qant voit venir

Le deable, lors deinz son entente

En ceste vie il se repente,

Qâapres ne luy falt repentir.

Une autre fois deinz sa memoire

Paour sâen vait en pourgatoire,

Et voit y moult diverse peine

Laide et puiante, horrible et noire,
11500

Plus que nuls cuers le porroit croire,

Ou langue dire qâest humeine:
[Pg 134]

Atant qâenfern celle est grieveine

Mais dâune chose tout souleine,

Qâen pourgatoire lâalme espoire

En fin dâavoir sa joye pleine,

Mais en enfern elle est certeine

Du p

Par droit Paour cil qâensi pense

11510

Que sanz mercy toutdis endure,

Et puis dedeins son cuer compe

Du pourgatoire lâevidence,

Je croi qâil ad tresbon

En celle gloire qâest dessure

Pour venir en la dieu p

11520

Ly sages dist en sa doctrine

Qe la coroune et la racine

Du sapience câest paour,

Qant envers dieu soulein encline

Par droit amour et discipline;

Car qui dieu crient ovesq
ue

Lors nâest vertu qui soit meillour.

Paour est mol plus q

Et plus poignant q
ue
nâest lâespine,

As bons est joye, as mals hidour;
11530

Qui son cuer serche en tenebrour

Paour la chandelle enlumine.

Paour qui dieu aime et confesse,

Câest le tresor et la richesse

De lâalme, ce dist YsaÃ¯e;

Et David dist parole exp

âQui dieu criemont en droite hu

Dieus les eshaulce et glorifie.â

Ce dist la vierge auci Marie,

âDu progenie en progenie

La mercy dieu leur ert imp

Qui criemont dieu en ceste vie.â

Pour ce fols est qâa ce ne plie,

Qant elle en fait si beau p

306

Du droit Paour je truis escript,

Saint Jeremie ensi le dist

A dieu par droite humiliance:

âO Roys du poair infinit,

Qui est celluy sans contredit,

Qui ne doit criendre ta puissance?
11550

Sur tout puiss faire ta plesance,

Car trestous susmes ta faisance,

O dieus, pour ce câest ma creance,

Nâest creature en nulle estance,

Qâa ton poair ne soit soubgit.

Et toute vertu reconcile,

Qant sens, valour, force ou beautÃ©,

Honour, richesce ou parentÃ©e

307

Au dieu soulein rent grace et grÃ©,

Pensant toutdis dâumilitÃ©

Qe sa nature est orde et vile.

Discrecio

Ad tout quatre oils, en resemblance
11570

f. 66

Des bestes, dont par leur figure

Lâapocalips fait remembrance:

De lâoill primer sanz variance

Voit clierement sa p

De lâautre voit la grande cure

Du siecle que chascuns endure;

Du tierce oil voit la p

Du ciel, u est la joye pure;

Du quarte oil voit la peine dure

Dâenfern ove celle circumstance.
11580

Des quatre p

Ne doit orguil avoir par droit;

Car pour soy mesmes regarder,

Com

Com

Com

Com

[Pg 135]

Sa char puante et devourer,

Com
m
ent lâacompte rendre doit

Des biens q
ue
dieus lâad fait bailler,

Par tous ces pointz considerer
11591

Orguil de cest oil ne conÃ§oit.

Pour regarder le siecle avant,

Si tu richesce y es voiant,

Pov

Si sauntÃ©, maladie atant,

Si joye, dolour habondant,

Qe pour veoir trestous estatz,

Les uns en halt, les uns en bas,

Tout gist p

11600

Tant est fortune variant:

Si de cel oil bien garderas,

Ne croi q
ue
tu tâorguilleras

Du siecle, qâest si deceivant.

Mais lâoil qui vers le ciel regarde

Par reso

Dâorguil; car la verra tout voir

Qe cil qui tint y lâavantgarde

Des angles, en la reregarde

Dâenfern orguil luy fist chaoir:
11610

Auci David nous fait savoir,

Qe pr

Nuls orguillo

De cest oill, puet tresbien veoir,

Poy valt orguil franÃ§oise avoir,

Qâau Surquider nâest pas bastarde.

De lâoill qâenv

Qe nulle orguil son cuer adesce

Car la verra com

11621

Du flamme que ne puet finir.

Qui de tiels oils se fait pourvir

Dâorguil se porra bien guenchir,

Qe surquidance ne luy blesce;

Et sâil tiels oils volra tenir,

Tout droitement porra venir

Au ciel, u dieus coron

Discrecio
u
n bien ordinÃ©

Par quatre causes hiet PecchÃ©:
11630

Primer pour ce q
ue
le corage

De lâom
m
e par sa malvoistÃ©

Destourne de sa libertÃ©,

Et fait q
ue
lâom
m
e est en servage;

Auci PecchÃ© de son oultrage

Corrupte fait la dieu ymage,

Puante, vile et abhosmÃ©e,

Câest lâalme, quelle se destage:

Po
ur
ce PecchÃ© du toute hontage

La droite mere est appellÃ©e.
11640

Lâen sert pour loer au final,

Car sans loer om p
re
nt au mal

Dâascun service sustenir;

Mais quiq
ue
soit official

Du PecchÃ© par especial,

De son loer ne doit faillir:

Lâapostre dist que le merir

Qe lâen du PecchÃ© doit tenir,

Câest celle mort qâest eternal.

Fols est pour ce qui voet servir
11650

Pour tiel reguerdo
u
n deservir,

Dont le p
ro
ufit est infernal.

Mais ly discret ove ses oils cliers

Est des vertus ly charettiers,

Qâes fosses ne les laist cheÃ¯r:

Si est auci par haltes mers

Du nief de lâalme conduisers,

Qâau port arrive sans perir.

Du trop se sciet bien abstenir,

Et a trop poy no
u
n assentir,
11660

Dâascune part nâest oultragiers;

Bien sciet aler, bien revenir,

Bien sciet les causes p
ar
fournir,

Dont est bien digne des loers.

Discrecio
u
n deinz sa peitrine

Toutdis p
re
nt garde a la doctrine

Que Salomon luy vait disant,

Qui dist qâau vanitÃ© decline

Trestout le siecle ove sa covine,

Nâest un soul rien qâest p

manant.
11670

Ce vait dieus mesmes tesmoigna

Qe ciel et terre en temps venant

Et lâun et lâautre se termine;

Excepcio
u

Qe sa parole ert ferm estant

Du p

durable discipline.

Du vanitÃ© trestout est vein
[Pg 136]

Le siecle, et lâom
m
e est auci vein,

Pour qui le siecle fuist creÃ©.

Trois choses le me font certein,
11680

Lâestat de lâom
m
e est no
u
ncertein

Et plein de mutabilitÃ©:

Primer de sa mortalitÃ©

Saint Job le dist en son degrÃ©:

âCom
m
e lâombre, ensi la vie humein;

Huy tu le voies en sauntÃ©,

Mais point ne scies u ert trovÃ©,

Si tu le voes sercher demein.â

He, dieus, qâest cil qui ne dirroit

Qe lâom
m
e vanitÃ© ne soit?
11690

Qant huy ce jour tes oils voiant

Chantoit, danÃ§oit et caroloit,

Et a jouster les grÃ©s avoit,

Et tous criont, âVaillant! vaillant!â

Et se sont mis a son devant

Pour son hono
ur
sicom
m
e servant:

Mais au demein di q
ue
ce soit;

Qâiert tous paiis hier po

Soubz poy de terre ore est gisant,

Nâest uns qui jam
m

11700

Par ses mortalitÃ©s ensi

Lâom
m
e est trop vein; si est auci

Sa curiositÃ© trop veine:

Car tous les faitz qâon fait icy

Com
m
e songe se passont p
ar
my,

Molt est la gloire no
u
ncerteine.

Le songe en sa figure enseine

Les joyes de la char humeine;

Qant lâen meulx quide estre saisy

De lâun ou lâautre en son demeine,
11710

Sicom
m
e la chose qâest foreine,

Semblablement sont esvany.

Lâom
m
e est encore, pour voir dire,

Des pecchÃ©s que sa char desire

Sur tout plus vein, bien me sovient:
308

Car du pecchÃ© dont lâalme enpire

Lâom
m
e est des autres bestes pire,

Et au plus malvois fin devient.
309

Si toutes bestes vont au nient,

Qe chalt, qant plus ne lo

11720

Mais lâom
m

Par pecchÃ© q

Tieu vanitÃ© fait a despire.

Et sâesjoÃ¿t qant se pourvoit;

Mais si sa face ait tache prise,

Car courtoisie est de sâacort,

Qâa nul bien unq

AinÃ§ois la sert com

Cassodre en son escript recort,
11770

Et dist toute autre vertu mort,

Si ceste nâest avant guyere.

Ce dist Senec, qâen trestous lieus

Om doit cherir et loer plus

Maniere, car qui Man

Il ad la guide des vertus.

Car sanz Maniere sont confus

Tout autre vertu qâom avra:

Sâil nâait ove ce Man

Cil qâest discret, u quâil irra,

De lâom

Et puis au toute creature:

Trop halt ne vole a desmesure,

Auci ne trop en bass descent,

Ainz com

Des temps, des causes, a tout hure

11800

Par tiele essample et tiel endroit

HonestetÃ© se fait guarder;

Car des vertus dont aourner

Se puet en faire ou en parler,

Dont corps et alme enbelli soit,

Se veste et laist les lais estier;

Car nullement voet adescer

La chose en quelle ordure voit.

Primer qant hom
m
e dieus crea,

Des deux natures luy fourma,
11810

Câest dâalme et corps ensemblement,

Et deux delices leur don
n
a,

Dont chascuns se delitera

Au dieu loenge soulement:

Lâun est au corps tout p

Qe les cynk sens forainement

Luy font avoir, mais pour cela

Qe lâautre a lâespirit appent,

Ce vient dâasses plus noblement

Dedeins le cuer, u lâalme esta.
11820

OÃ¯r, veoir, flairer, gouster,

Taster, ce sont ly cynk porter,

P
ar
queux trestous les biens foreins

Vienont le corps pour deliter;

Mais qâom nâen doit pas mesuser

Discrecio

Car trestous biens qui sont mondeins

Bons sont as bons, mais as vileins;

Mais ly discret se sciet temprer,

Qâil ja nâen ert p

11830

Solonc qâil ad ou plus ou meins,

Hon

Ly bien mondain qâay susnomÃ©,

Du quoy ly corps sâest delitÃ©

Par les cynk sens, si jâen dirroie,
311

Nâest qâune goute de rosÃ©e,

Dont si mon corps ay abev

Ã©

Ma soif estancher ne porroie,

Au regard de celle autre joye,

Dont lâalme boit et se rejoye
11840

Pensant a la divinitÃ©:

Câest la fontaine cliere et coye,

La quelle sauntÃ© nous envoye,

Si tolt la soif dâenfermetÃ©.

As ses disciples dieus disoit:

âQuiconq

Une fontaine au tiel exploit,

Qâen p

Mais lâautre sanz fin estre doit.

Et sustient, siqâen un soul point

Du droit chemin ne se forsvoie.

Des deux biens au meillo

Et de deux mals le pis renoie;

Bien sciet eslire a son desjoint,

Qâil puis ne dirra, âJe quidoieâ:

Car sapience le convoie,

Qâas tous temps est ove luy conjoint.

Je sui certains que Salomon

Nâestoit pas sans discrecio

11870

Qant il lâespeie demandoit

Pour faire la divisio
u

Du vif enfant, pour qui tenÃ§o

Ensi discrecio

De lâune et lâautre governance,

Câest lâalme et corps; car p

Nâest chose plus ou busoignable,

Que tient mesure en la balance.

Vers dieu primer sa po

De lâalme fait, et puis avance

Par quoy puis pour sa bienfesa

Ore dirra de la quarte file de HumilitÃ©, quelle a

Encontre lâorguil dâAvantance,

Pour ce ne fait greigneur p

Et molt se sont entresemblable:

Mais Honte pour descrire est celle,

Qe ja si faulse nâest querelle,

Sâom la surmet qâelle est coupable,

Tantost sa chere en est muable;
314

11911

Mais Vergoigne ad la chere estable,

Si du falsine lâen lâappelle,

Qant voit bien q

Mais si la culpe est veritable,

Tantost ly change la maisselle.

Molt est Vergoigne simple et coye,

Car toutdis dâumble cuer se ploie,

Siq

Pour lâonour q

11920

Jam

Pour soy vanter en nul acompte,

Ainz ad le cuer si plain de honte,

Qe sâaucun autre le raconte,

Toute sa chere tourne en voie:

Del pris du siecle se desmonte,

Dont voelt q

En honour et p

Qui du Vergoigne est vertuous,

Car du penser qâest vicious

Et nepourqant ce dist le sage,

Qe cil qui rougist le visage

Par vergonder de sa folour,

Câest un bon signe du corage;

Car quiqâil soit, il crient hontage,

Gregoire dist en son Moral,

Trois choses par especial

DâumilitÃ© font demoustrance:

Câest le primer et principal,

Ses sovereins en gen

Obeie sanz desobeissance,

En fait, en dit, en contenance;

Puis nâappara p

Qâa son pareil soit p

Ne des soubgitz vaine hono

Lors portera verrai signal.

âHumilitÃ©,â seint Bernard dist,

âSoy mesmes tant tient en despit

Que nuls la porroit tant despireâ:

DâumilitÃ© saint Bede escrit,

Qe câest la clief soubz quelle gist

Science, dont tout bien respire.
12450

QâumilitÃ© lâen doit eslire,

Du TholomÃ© lâen porra lire,

Qâestoit un philosophre eslit,

Qui dist: âTous sages a descrire,

Cil est plus sages, pour voir dire,
329

Qui plus est humble dâespirit.â

HumilitÃ© la graciouse

A lâarbre belle et fructuouse

Est resemblable en sa covine;

Car tant com
m

us
ramouse

Soit, et du fruit plus plentivouse,
12461

De tant vers terre plus sâencline:

Semblable auci je la diffine

Au piere dyamant tresfine,

Qâen orr seoir est dedeignouse,
[Pg 145]

De la richesse se decline

Et est au povre ferr encline,

Si en devient plus vertuouse.
330

La palme endroit de sa nature

Porte une fo

12470

Sur toutes arbres plus souleine;

Elle ad son trunc en sa mesure

Petit p

Le trunc est gross: ce no

HumilitÃ©, que lâalme meine

Humble et petite en vie humeine

Sanz orguil et sanz fole cure:

Par terre croistre se desdeigne,

Mais vers le ciel est grosse et pleine

Plus q

12480

Lâumble est semblable au bon berbis,

Qâa nous p

Mais son honour ne quiert ne pense;

Et puis au fin qâil soit occis

Il souffre, siqâen nul devis

Voet faire aucune resistence:

Et par semblable obedience

Lâom

Combien quâil digne soit du pris,

Saint Bernards le dist ensement,

Et si nous donne essamplement

De lâestomac, qui trop se ghient,

Qant om le paist trop plainement;

Car autrement tout sont folour

Tan

Du quoy devient et maigre et mat:

Mais lors, qant force le debat,

Tenir en droit de sa nature.

Câest la vertu q

Ove Gloutenie se combat,

Et la met a desconfiture.

Quiconq

En tiele guise il la repaste,

Quâil fait courtois de la vileine.

Mais sâil avient ensi par cas

Qe lâabstinent dâascun solas

Par compaignie estuet manger,

Des bons mangers le doulz ou crass,

Ou boire vin des beals hanaps,
16301

La bouche sâen poet deliter

Des tieus delices savourer,

Mais ja ly cuers de son gouster

Par mal ne sâen delite pas;

Ainz rent loenge a dieu loer,

Car point ne trove y du vitaille

Lors qant ne trove q

Com

Qant la viande qâest remise

Qe deinz son cuer bien luy sovient

Qâil dâascun pecchÃ© nâait lesure.

Car sur trestoute creature

Mais ce nâest pas p

Au fin q

Car vierge doit tout au primer

Tieux sont les grains dont est p

Lors rent a dieu son droit paiage;

Et autrement, sâensi ne vait,

Tout est en vein que vierge fait,

Car pl

Mais po

Trois causes sont en general

Pour exciter lâumanitÃ©

Pour la tresfine bealtÃ©,
17010

La seconde est pour la bontÃ©,

Et la tierce est pour dignetÃ©:

Ce sont ly cause principal

Qâom doit amer virginitÃ©;

De chascun point en son degrÃ©

Vous dirray par especial.

Ly sages dist en sa doctrine:

âO com

Auci Jerom de ce diffine,
17020

Si dist q

Com

Legierement si tache y soit.

Câest la beautÃ© que dieus amoit

Et la retint de sa covine,

Qant prendre n

Dont mâest avis amer lâen doit

Lâestat q

[Pg 198]

De la bontÃ© ce nous devise

Jerom, qui dist en ceste guise,
17030

Qâestat du vierge est purement

Offrende a dieu et sacrefise,

Qant om le gart du bon

Dont grant loer au fin reprent.

De saint Jehan lâexperiment

De tous les saintz qâom doit nom

Et plus privÃ© de son seignour:

Apocalips doit tesmoigner

Qe vierges doit plus halt monter

Qâen halt le ciel sup

Devant le throne dieu maiour

Et pour la grant bontÃ© de lour

Fait lâalme digne en son demeine;

Car saint Gregoire vait disant,

Qe cil qui vit en char humeine

Et contre char sa char restreine,

Si qâa sa char nâest obeissant,
17070

Est as bons angres comparant:

Et plus le loe encore avant

Du dignetÃ© qâest plus halteine.

Dâun Roy dâAthenes qui fuist dit

Chodrus, qâadonques guerroia

A ceaux dâOrense, car soubgit

Qui la victoire enportera;

Et lâautre a ce luy repondit,

Et qant ly Roys oÃ¯st ce dire,

Pour la salut qe ses soubgitz

Tu puiss respondre et dire, Helas!

Qe tu le cuer si couard as,

Dont tu te voes bien abstenir:
20010

AinÃ§ois lerras trestous perir,

Qâun soul doy de ta main blemir.

Mais es tu donques bons p

Certes nenil, mais pour cherir

Le corps, qui puis te fra venir

A lâeveschÃ© qui tient Judas.

Ne say a qui puiss resembler

Le fol prelat de son mestier,

Mais sicom

Au prestre qui se fist passer,

Et puis ly deacne, sanz aider

A lâom

Et grant souffraite dâaide avoit:

Chascun des deux les mals veoit,

Mais nuls le voloit socourer,

Tanqâau darrein y survenoit

Uns paiens, qui le socourroit,

Et ensi guaste son avoir.

Mais le dieu grÃ© nâen puet avoir,

Car nuls as deux servir porroit

Car cil qui fra le dieu voloir,

Servir au siecle point ne doit.

Cil qâest servant de la dieu co

Coment a dieu responderont.

Des fols curetz auci y a,

Qui sur sa cure demourra

Non pour curer, mais qâil la vie

Et ensi sur toute autre gent

Puis sont en leur orguil levÃ©

Car lâun a lâautre puis mella,

Mais les Caldieus alors halÃ§a

Et la victoire leur don

[Pg 247]

Mais leur pris guaires ne dura,

Car sâil avient quâil tâest p

Câest un des chiefs le prim

Par qui Fortune te confonde.
22200

Un autre chief duissetz avoir,

Mais voegles ad les oills po

Si ad tout sourdes les oreilles;

Ne puet oÃ¯r, ne puet veoir,
[Pg 249]

Si mal te vient, qâen poet chaloir?

Helas, Fortune, as tes merveilles;

Câest lâaigle dâorr qui tu nâesveilles,

Câest cil qui tient les nefs sanz veilles

Et les chivalx sanz removoir.

He Rome, jadys sanz pareilles,

De sa primere duetÃ©,

Doit sainte eglise en son degrÃ©

Defendre, q

Et puis doit de sa RoialtÃ©

Selonc justice et equitÃ©

Guarder la loy dedeinz sa bonde.

Tiele est la duetÃ© des Roys,

Amer et servir dieu ainÃ§ois,

Et sainte eglise maintenir,

Et garder salvement les loys:
22240

Mais ils font ore nul des trois;

Car ils nâont cure a dieu servir,

Et dâautre p

Du sainte eglise, ainz qâeslargir

Ne les franchises ne les droitz;

Et nulle loy vuillont tenir

Mais ce qui vient a leur plesir,

Sicom

Rois sainte eglise trop enpire,

Qant il nient joustement sâaÃ¯re

Encontre ascun qâest son prelat,

Et sur cela luy fait occire:

Combien qâil soit son lige sire,

Il duist doubter si saint estat;

Qui sainte eglise ensi rebat

Encontre mesmes dieu combat,

Mais il ne le puet desconfire;

Ainz tant com

Tant plus serra du guerre mat,

Qant il son ease plus desire.

Du Roy, pour faire sa plesance

En la mondaine vanitÃ©.

O Rois, fai ce que tu porras,

Qe sages soient tes prelatz,

A ce quâils facent leur devoir;

Et lors tu les desporteras,

Que malgrÃ© leur ne porteras

Pour la bataille quâil attent.

âMane, ton pueple tâad guerpi;

Techel, tu nâas bontÃ© par qui

Qe dieus tâen voet don
n
er confort;

Phares, ton regne est departi,
22750

Car dieus voet qâautre en soit saisi,
556

Et tu serras du pecchÃ© mort.â

O Rois, pren guarde et te po
ur
voie,

Qe tiele l
ett
re ne tâenvoie

Dieus, qui les Rois tient en justice;

En trop de vin ne te festoie,

Dont ta luxure multeploie,

Car câest en Roy trop orde vice:

Et dâautre p
ar
t pour lâavarice
[Pg 251]

Ne fai a lâorr ton sacrefice,
22760

Car Rois doit estre toute voie

F
ra
ncs en toutz pointz, mais trop est nice

Cil Rois qâen servitute esclise,

Et de franchise se desvoie.

Dedeinz la bible escript je lis

Dâun Roy qui demandoit jadis

Des quatre de ses chambreleins,

Et g

22769

Qâest ce q

Dâavisement, dont plus certeinz

Lâun dist q

sur trestous humeinz

Du force Roy fuist souvereinz;

Car Roy tous autrez ad soubgiz.

Mais ly secondes respondy,

Qe fem

557

Car fem

Lâessample veons chascun dy,
22780

Maint Roy en est trop malbailly,

Qâau peine nuls se sciet garder.

Ly tierce dist, qâau droit juger,

Le vin trestout puet surmonter,

P

Car Roy et fem

Retient, et tolt leur force et cuer,

Et tout le membre ovesq

Le quarte dist que veritÃ©

Toute autre chose ad surmontÃ©;
22790

Car veritÃ© de son droit fin,

Qant tous serront ovel jugÃ©,

Tout veint la fole vanitÃ©

Du Roy, des fem

Cil qui ce dist ot le cuer fin

Du sapience et bon engin,

Dont sa response tint en grÃ©

Ly Rois, ensi com
m
e dâun divin.

Bien doit pour ce le Roy cristin

Amer justice et loyaltÃ©.
22800

Rois doit la veritÃ© cherir

Sur toute chose et obeÃ¯r,

Ce dist Sidrac; et nepourqant

Ore voit om Roy tous ceaux haÃ¯r

Qui voir diont, mais qui blandir

Luy vuillont, cils serront mana

Voir dist qui dist fem

Et ce voit om du meintenant:

Dieus pense de les mals guarir,

Qâas toutes loys est descordant,
22810

Qe fem

Et Rois soubgit pour luy servir.

Rois est des fem

Qant plus les ayme q

Cil Rois ne serra pas cremu,

Qâensi voet laisser son escu

Et querre le bataille ou lit.

Du Roy David je truis escrit

Que pour son charnel appetit
22820

Du BersabÃ©e, quâil ot conu,

Vilainement fuist desconfit;

Car Rois ne serra ja parfit

Qâest de sa frele char vencu.

Dedeinz la bible qui lira

Des Rois, sovent y trov
er

Qe pour les mals q
ue
Rois faisoit

Non soulement dieus se venga

Sur le Roy mesme, ainz pour cela

Trestout le pueple chastioit;
22830

Mais p
ar
contraire en nul endroit

Ne lis quâil sur le Roy vengoit

Les mals du pueple cy ne la:

Rois est le chief solonc son droit,

Dont si le chief malade soit,

Nâest membre qui dolour nâara.

Ensi le mal du Roy ceux fiert

As queux le pecchÃ© point nâaffiert;

Car ce dont Rois son dieu offent

Sovent le pueple le compiert,
22840

Par quoy du Roy, com
m

Les pecchÃ©s sont trop violent.

Dieu ne se venga p

De David qâot fait folement,

Ainz pour le Roy le poeple quiert:

Bien doit ly Rois estre dolent
[Pg 252]

Qant il au pueple tielement

Po

Car tost com

558

Dont il son dieu remercioit,

Et puis se contienoit ensi,

Quâil soy et tout le pueple auci

Al dieu plesance governoit.
22860

O Rois, retien en remembrance

Du Roy David la repentance:

Hostetz de toy le fol desir,

Qui fait amerrir ta puissance,

Hostetz de toy fole ignorance,

Que ta justice fait blemir;

Et si tu voes au bien venir,

Dâorguil ne te dois sovenir:

Pren consail sage en tâalliance,

Et sur tout te dois abstenir
22870

Du covoitise, et lors tenir

Porras la bon
n
e governance.

Ly Rois David, com
m
e dist lâaucto
ur
,

Estoit des six pointz essamplour,
559

Dont chascun Roy puet essampler:

Ly Rois David estoit pastour,

Ly Rois David estoit harpour,

Ly Rois David fuist chivaler,

Ly Rois David en son psalter

Estoit p
ro
phete a dieu loer,
22880

Ly Rois David en doel et plour

Estoit penant, et pour regner

David fuist Rois, si qâau parler

As autrez Rois il fuist mirour.

Au pastour falt prim
er
ement

Qâil ses berbitz discretement

Les ruignous houste de les seins:

Bons Rois covient quâil tielement

Deinz son hostell la bon
n
e gent

Retiene et hoste les vileins.
22890

Berbis qâest de la ruigne atteins

Les autres qui luy sont p
ro
cheins

Entusche: et lâom
m
e qâest present

Entour le Roy fait plus ne meinz;

Des males mours dont il est pleins

Corrumpt les autres malement.

Au bon harpour falt de nature

Mettre en accord et attemprure

Les cordes de sa harpe, ensi

Qe celle corde p
ar
dessure
22900

Ne se descorde a la tenure,

Et puis qâa lâun et lâautre auci

Face acorder la corde enmy;

Mais au darrein covient a luy

Quâil de Musique la droiture

Bien garde; et lors ad tout compli,

Dont cils qâaront la note oÃ¿

Sâesjoyeront de la mesure.

Ensi falt q
ue
ly Rois en terre

Sache attemprer et lâacord fere
22910

Du pueple dont la gov
er
nance

Il ad resÃ§u, siqâau bienfere

Chascuns endroit de son affere

Soit temprez en droite ordina
n
ce,

Le seigno
ur
soit en sa puissance

Et la com
m
une en obeissance,

Lâun envers lâautre sanz mesfere:

Rois qâensi fait la concordance

Bien porra du fine attempra
n
ce

La harpe au bon
n
e note trere.
22920

David bon chivaler estoit

Du cuer et corps, dont surmontoit

La force de ses anemys;

Qant po
ur
la foy se combatoit,

Dieus son miracle demoustroit,

Dont il avoit loenge et pris.

Car la fortune a les hardis

Sâencline, mais Rois qâest eschis

A batailler qant il ad droit,

Il nâest pas de David apris;
22930

Mais sâil defende son paiis,

Lors fait cela que faire doit.

Prophete estoit le bon Davy,

Loyal, certain, car tant vous dy,
[Pg 253]

Ce quâil disoit ne fuist pas fable.

f. 126

Rois qui sâessamplera de luy

Covient tricher envers nully,

Car Roys doit estre veritable

De sa parole, et non changable;

Et autrement, sâil soit muable,
22940

Il ad sa RoialtÃ© failly:

Mais Rois qâen veritÃ© sâestable,

Par ce son regne fait estable,

Si ert a dieu p
ro
chein amy.

David estoit auci penant,

Du cuer contrit et repentant,

De ce quâil dieu ot offendu,

Dont fist penance sufficant

Par quoy soy mesmes tout ava
n
t

Et puis le pueple en sa vertu
22950

Guarist de la vengance dieu:

O Rois, ensi covient que tu

Par repentance eietz garant

De tes pecchÃ©s, dont absolu

Estre porretz, ainz q
ue
vencu

Soietz del ire au toutpuissant.

Mais au final David fuist Rois,

Qui bien guardoit les bon
n
es lois.

Mais pour retourner a cela

Des pointz dont vous ay dit ainÃ§ois,

Le temps est ore plus malvois,
22961

Nâest qui David essamplera:

Pres du pastour ore om verra

Berbis ruignous, dont trop y a;
560

Et del harpour diont FranÃ§ois,

La harpe est en discord pieÃ§a.

U est qui bien nous harpera?

Je ne say dire a ceste fois.

Pour parler de chivalerie

De David et sa p
ro
phecie,
22970

Du prouesce et du veritÃ©,

Nâest pas a moy q
ue
je le die,

Mais om dist que lâessamplerie

Du n
ost
re terre en est alÃ©,
561

Et q
ue
David sâestoit penÃ©

Po
ur
ses pecchÃ©s, ore est tournÃ©

Po
ur
lâease avoir de ceste vie,

Et la justice en RoialtÃ©

Que David tint, desloyaltÃ©

De mal consail lâad forsbannie.
22980

O Rois, enten, si fretz q
ue
sage,

Danz Tullius tâen fait message,

Disant q
ue
câest au Roy g
ra
nt honte,

Qui p
ar
bataille et fier corage

Tous veint, et soy laist en servage

Du covoitise, et tant amonte

Qâil nâest pas Rois a droit acompte:

Del une part car si lâen conte

Quâil ad prouesce et vassallage,

Del autre p
ar
t son pris ne monte;
22990

Qant covoitise luy surmonte,

Lâonour du Roy se desparage.

O Rois, dâorguil ton cuer retien,

De lâescripture et te sovien.

Dieus dist, âA la coron
n
e way

Qâest orguillouse!â car nâest rien

Que dieus tant hiet, ce savons bien;

Plusours en ont trovÃ© lâessay:
562

Mais dâautre p
ar
t tresbien le say,

O Rois, si voes servir au pay
23000

Ton dieu, humblesce en toy maintien,

Com
m
e fist David, ensi le fay:

Lâessample vous en conteray,
563

Ascoulte, Rois, et le retien.

Molt ot David humble espirit,

Ce parust bien qant il oÃ¯t

SemeÃ¿, qui luy vint maldire

En son meschief p
ar
g
ra
nt despit,

Et il le fist du mort respit,

DâumilitÃ© restreigna lâire:
23010

Auci lâen puet de SaÃ¼l lire

Quâil querroit David po
ur
lâoccire,

Po
ur
ce David point ne lâoccit,

Qant ot poer, dont n
ost
re sire

Puis saisist David de lâempire

Et Roy SaÃ¼l fuist desconfit.

Sicom
m
e la force eschiet du Roy

Par son orguil et par desroy,

Ensi sâavance humilitÃ©.

Ce parust en la viele loy,
23020

Senacherib ove son buffoy

Qant Ezechie ot manacÃ©
[Pg 254]

Et cil sâestoit humiliÃ©,

Dieus son miracle ad demoustrÃ©:

Oytante Mil et cynk, ce croy,

Del host paiene il ad tuÃ©,

Et puis luy mesme en sa contrÃ©

Ses fils tueront en recoy.

O Roys, tu es a dieu conjoynt,

Qant p
ar
les meins dâevesq
ue
enoint

Es du sainte oile, et pour cela
23031

Remembre a ce q
ue
tâest enjoint,

De vertu ne soietz desjoynt,

Car Rois p
ar
droit le vice harra:

De sa nature lâoile esta

Mol et p
er
Ã§ant, dont Rois serra

Pitous et joust, siqâen nul point

Al un nâal autre falsera;

PitÃ© joustice attemprera,

Quâil crualtÃ© ne ferra point.
23040

O Rois, si bien fais ton devoir,

Deux choses te covient avoir,

Ce sont pitÃ©s et jugement,

Ne lâun sanz lâautre poet valoir:

Tu ne te dois tant esmovoir

Du pitÃ©, dont la male gent

Soit inpunie, et autrement

Tu dois sanz pitÃ© nullement

Juger de ton roial pooir

Pour nul corous q
ue
toi susp
re
nt,
23050

Ainz du pitÃ© benignement

Fai la malice removoir.

Senec le dist qâa RoialtÃ©

Plus qâa nul autre affiert pitÃ©,

Et le bon Emp
er
our Constant

Nous dist q
ue
cil sâest bien p
ro
vÃ©

Seigneur en droite veritÃ©,

Qui du pitÃ© se fait servant:

Cassodre auci ce vait disant,

Qe tout le regne en ad garant,
564

23060

U q
ue
pitÃ©s sâest herbergÃ©;

Et qui la bible en vait lisant
565

Verra justice molt vaillant,

Qant du mercy serra mellÃ©e.

Ly Rois qâest joust et debon
n
ere

Nâestuet doubter le fait du guerre

Pour multitude de la gent

Qâau tort vienont po
ur
luy surquere;

Car mesmes dieu leur est contrere

Et les maldist molt fierement,
23070

Com
m
e YsaÃ¯e nous aprent:

Ly Machabieus tout ensement,

Qâassetz savoit de tiel affere,

Dist que victoire ne se prent

En multitude, ainÃ§ois attent

En dieu, si Roys luy voet requere.

O Rois, si estre voes p
ar
fit,

Fai ce pour quoy tu es eslit,

Justice au pueple fai don
n
er;

Ly Rois qui par justice vit
23080

Ja nâert du guerre desconfit.

Ce dist David en son psalter,

âJustice et pes sâen vont aler

Com
m
e mere et file entrebaiserâ:

Car de justice pes nasquist;

Pour ce justice est a guarder
566

Au Roy qui voldra pes amer,

Car câest le chief de son habit.

O Rois, si tu del un oil voies

Les grans honours, les g
ra
ndes joyes

De ta coron
n
e et ta noblesce,
23091

De lâautre part repenseroies

Com
m
e es chargez diversez voies

De ce dont dieus tâad fait largesce.

Si tu bien gardes la p
ro
messe,

Com
m
e ta coron
n
e le p
ro
fesse,

Et ton devoir nâen passeroies,

Lors sanz faillir, je me confesse,

Les charges passont la richesce,

Si lâun ove lâautre compensoiez.
23100

Lâestat du Roy est honourable,

Mais cel honour est descheable

Au siecle qui ne puet durer;

Car mort que ja nâert m
er
ciable

Ne truist le Roy plus defensable

Qâun povre vilein labourer,

Et tout ensi naist au primer

Le Roy com
m
e fait le povre bier,

Nature leur fait resemblable,

Mais soul lâestatz font diverser;
23110

[Pg 255]

Dont si ly Rois ad plus poer,

Tant plus vers dieu est acomptable.

Qui plus en halte estage monte,

Sâil en cherra, mal se desmonte,
567

Dont trop se blesce; et tout ensi

Par cas semblable tant amonte

Ly Rois, qui tous estatz surmonte;

Sâil soit des vices assailly

Et soit vencu, tant plus failly

Serra coupable et malbailly,
23120

Qant a son dieu rendra lâacompte,

Qui la p
er
son
n
e de nully

Respite. O Rois, pour ce te dy,

Pren garde a ce que je te conte.

Câest bien reso
u
n, si Rois mal fait,

Qe sâalme plus du paine en ait
568

Qâuns autres de menour degrÃ©:

f. 127

Car si la povre gent mesfait,

Sur eaux reverte le mesfait,

Dont sont du siecle chastiÃ©e;
23130

Mais si ly Rois fait malvoistÃ©,

Nâest qui pourra sa RoyaltÃ©

Punir, ainz quit de son forsfait

Irra tout a sa volentÃ©,

Tanq
ue
la haulte deitÃ©

Luy fait ruer de son aguait.

O Rois qui meines vie fole,

AinÃ§ois q
ue
lâire dieu tâaffole,

Fai amender ta fole vie;

Car qant tu vendras a lâescole
23140

U tâalme doit respondre sole,

Ne te valdra chivalerie,

Ne RoialtÃ© ne seigneurie,

Ainz la reso
u
n qâas deservie

Du ciel ou dâinfernal gaiole

Lâun dois avoir sanz departie:

Ore elisetz a ta partie

Le quel te plaist, ou dure ou mole.

Ainz qâautre chose a dieu prioit

Rois Salomon, qâil luy voldroit
23150

Don

Par quelle du justice et droit

Dont sa priere en audience

Et pour ce q

Du bien, dâonour et de science,

Plus qâunq

23160

Lâessample au Salomon le sage

Loign du memoire ad pris passage,

Nâest Rois qui le voet repasser

Pour le tenir deinz son corage,

Ainz prent du poeple son pilage

Et laist justice oultrepasser.

Si dieus consail du losenger

Dâentour le Roy ne voet hoster,

Trop avons p

Car chascun jour renoveller

Dont chascuns sente le dam

Qe Rois consail du covoitise

Ly philosophre en son aprise;

Car tiel consail honour ne prise

Ne le com

De fals Judas lâessamplement
23180

Bon est q
ue
chascun Roy sâavise;

Car il pour lucre de lâargent

Son Roy trahist au male gent,

Qui puis en suffrit la juise.
570

Mais cil qui mal consail dorra,

Ly mals sur soy revertira,

Qant il meinz quide q

Ce dist Sidrac, et de cela

Achitofel nous essampla,

Qant Absolon ove soit retient
23190

Cusy, a qui consail se tient

Et le pourpos volt guarder nient

QâAchitofel luy consailla;

Dont il tant anguissous devient,

Qâas ses deux mains le hart enprie

O dieus, qant ly plus seigneural

Ou a qui lors se porront pleindre,

Qant cils qâap

En chivaler, siquâil desire

Le lucre, dont il se repose:

Des tiels y ad com
m
e je suppose

Plus de quatorsze en cest empire.

Ne say quoy valt cil chivaler

Qui point ne se voet essampler

Des armes, dont il soit vaillant,

Si com
m

Ne voet au bon hospiteller

Saint Julian ne tant ne qant,
23850

Dont soit les povres herbergant:

Car chivaler qâest sufficant

De corps et biens et travailler

Ne voet, et est sur ce tenant

DâescharcetÃ©, meinz est vaillant

Que nâest le ciphre a comparer.

Mais si le chivaler couchour

Ne guart la reule ne lâonour

De ce que son estat destine,

Ore aguardons de lâautre tour
23860

Si cil qâas armes son retour

Fait, soit honeste en sa covine.

Il est tout voir qâen ce termine

Dessur la terre et dessoubz myne

Om voit que chivaler plusour

Quieront prouesce oultremarine,

Mais si leur cause fuist divine,

Bien fuissent digne de valour.

Sisz chivalers sont dit des prus,

Roys Charles, Godefrois, Arthus,
23870

Dans JosuÃ©, Judas, Davy:

En tous leur faitz prouesce truis

Plain des loenges et vertus

Vers dieu et vers le siecle auci:

Par ceaux nâestoit orguil cheri

Ne covoitise, et tant vous dy,

Câestoit la cause dont veneuz

Nâestoiont de leur anemy;

Et pour ce quâils firont ensi

Leur no

23880

Câestoiont chivaler au droit

Et de prouesce en son endroit,

Et de simplesce en sa mesure;

Dont au p

Qe p

A querre honour sanz mesprisure.

Des chivalers ore a ceste hure

Si travaillont a g

Et vont querant leur aventure;
23890

f. 131

Dont reso

Si ce p

O chivaler, je tâen dirray,

Tu qui travailles a lâessay

Dev

[Pg 264]

La cause dont tu vas ne say,

Trois causes tâen diviseray,

Les deux ne valont une alie:

La primere est, si jâensi die

De ma prouesce enorguillie,
23900

âPour loos avoir je passerayâ;

Ou autrement, âCâest po

Dont puiss avoir sa druerie,

Et pour ce je travailleray.â

O chivaler, savoir porras,

Si tu pour tiele cause irras,

Que je tâen vois cy divisant,

Lâessample point ne suieras,

Ne dâarmes ceaux resembleras,

Des queux tu mâas oÃ¿ contant:
23910

Car nul puet estre bien vaillant,

Sâil dieu ne mette a son devant;

Mais tu, qui po

le siecle vas,

Si ton po

Solonc ce q

Lors je ne say quoy tu ferras.

Si tu dâorguil voes travailler

Pour vaine gloire seculer,

Dont soietz le sup

Des autres, lors tâestuet don

Ton garnement et ton denier

As les heraldz, quâil ta valour

Et ta largesce a g

Facent crier; car si lâonour

Ne te voet celle part aider,

Lors je ne say quoy ton labour

Te puet valoir, ainz a sojour

Assetz te valt meulx reposer.

Et dâautre part si ta covine

Soit pour la cause femeline,
23930

Dont as le cuer enamourÃ©,

Et sur ce passes la marine,

A revenir si la meschine

Ou dame solonc son degrÃ©,

Pour quelle tu tâes travaillÃ©,

Ne deigne avoir de toy pitÃ©,

Tout as failly du medicine:

Car ce sachetz du veritÃ©,

Qe tu nâen aras le bon grÃ©

De la prouesce qâest divine.
23940

Et nepourqant a mon avis,

Si plainement a ton divis

De lâun et lâautre qâai nomÃ©

Ussetz le point en toy compris,

Primer q

Sur tous les autrez renomÃ©

Fuissetz et le plus honourÃ©,

Et qâussetz a ta volentÃ©

Le cuer de tes amours conquis,

Trestout ce nâest que vanitÃ©;
23950

Car huy es en p

Et lâendemain tout est failliz.

Mais dâautre p

La tierce cause nâest ensi,

Pour quelle ly p

Ainz est p

Ton dieu, qâa toy prouesce baille,

23961

Car chivaler qâensi se taille

O chivaler, bien te pourpense,

En qui tout bien fine et com

Ou pour la veine rev

Pour fol lâen puet celluy tenir

Qant il en voit la difference:

Al un des deux te falt tenir,

Mais quel te vient pl

Je laiss dessur ta conscience.

Mais dont la chose est avenue

Ne say, ne dont le mal se mue;

Car ce voit bien cil qâore vit,

Chivalerie est trop p

Car dâorguil ou du foldelit

Chivalerie est maintenue.

Les chivalers et lâescuiers,

Qui sont as armes costum

23990

Sâils bien facent leur duetÃ©,

Sur tous les autres seculers

Sont a louer, car leur mestiers

Du siecle est le plus honourÃ©

De prouesce et de renomÃ©e:

Mais autrement en leur degrÃ©,

En cas qâils soiont baratiers,

Lors serront ils ly plus blamÃ©

Par tout le siecle et diffamÃ©

Et des privÃ©s et dâestrangiers.
24000

Les armes sont com

Mais tous ne sont chivalerous

Queux no

Car cil qâest vein et orguillous

Et du pilage covoitous

Nâest digne a tiel hono

Mais ore, helas! qui voet attendre

Et le com

Lâonour dont lâen souloit ascendre

En cest estat veons descendre,
24011

Qâest a tous autres p

Mais cil qâau droit se voet armer

Et sur les guerres travailler,

Estuet a guarder tout avant

Pour la querelle examiner,

Quâil ne se face a tort lever,

Dont ert la cause defendant:

Et puis falt qâil se soit armant

Non pour le lucre tant ne qant,
24020

Mais pour droiture supporter;

Car qui les paiis exilant

Vait et la povre gent pilant,

Sur tous se doit bien aviser.

Combien q
ue
la querelle soit

Bien juste, encore il se deÃ§oit

Qui pour le vein honour avoir,

Ainz q

Se fait armer; ou dâautre endroit,

Sâil arme et tue pour lâavoir
24030

De les richesces rescevoir,

De son estat ne son devoir

Ne fait ensi com

Pour ce chascuns se doit veoir

Quâil sache dâarmes tout le voir,

Car sages est qui se pourvoit.

Selonc lâentente que tu as,

Du bien et mal resceiveras,

Car dieus reguarde ton corage:

En juste cause tu porras
24040

Tort faire, car si tu tâen vas

Plus po

Qe pour le droit, lors vassellage

Par ton maltolt se desparage,

Qe nul honour deserviras:

Mais si pour droit fais ton voiage,

Lors pris, honour et avantage

Trestout ensemble avoir porras.

Mais certes ore je ne say

De ces gens dâarmes quoy dirray,

Qâensi disant les ay oÃ¯z:
24051

âEs guerres je travailleray,

Je serray riche ou je morray,

Ainz q

Mais riens p

âJe pour le droit combateray,â

Ainz sont du covoitise espris;

Mais cil nâest digne dâavoir pris

Qui dâarmes fait ensi lâessay.
24060

O chivaler qui vas longtein

En terre est

Si ton paiis et ton p

De ton paiis et estrangez:

Car cil qui laist ses duetÃ©s,

Et ne voet faire son certein,

Ainz fait ses p

24070

Nâest reso

Combien quâil soit du forte mein.

Mais qui la guerre au tort conspire,

[Pg 266]

Om doit celluy sur tout despire;

Et nepo

Pour le p

Ou pour lâorguil du vein honour

Ou a ce faire consaillour;
24080

Dont la justice trop enpire

En noz paiis p

f. 132

Trestous en faisons no clamour,
587

Mais nâest qui puet trov

Qant cils en qui toute prouesce,

Honour, valour, bontÃ©, largesce

Et loyaltÃ© duissent remeindre,

Se p

Par covoitise ou par haltesce,

De lâonour seculer atteindre,
24090

Ne say a qui me doy compleindre;

Car cils qui sont du poeple meindre

Tous jours en sentent la destresce:
588

Si dieus les mals ne vuille exteindre,

Nâest qui de soy les puet enpeindre

Au fin q

Ce veons bien, qâau temps p

Qâau paine y ad nul labourer

Ly quel a son mestier se p

Le prestre laist le sacrement

Et ly vilains le charner,

Tous vont as armes travailler.

Si dieus ne pense a lâamender,

Lâen puet doubter p

Qe tout le mond doit rev

Car qant com

Par orguil et par covoitise

Lâen voit p

Helas! mais câest des cristiens

Dont est destruite sainte eglise,

Et la justice en sa f

Et si nous falt la bone aprise,

Car ils tollont le sustenir

Mais qui tieux mals no

O Covoitise ove ton pilage,

Sur tout se pleignt la gent meno

Que trop nous grieve le visconte:

Apres la mort a lâeschequer

Des soubz baillifs y ad tout plein

Car si visconte soit malvois,

Encore sont ils plus vilein;

Car ils pilont et paile et grein,

Si lâargent ne leur vient ainÃ§ois.

Vei la ministre de noz loys,

Envers dieu nâenvers leur p

Car il ne chalt p

Du vin franÃ§ois le vin du Rin,

26120

Et dist Reneys au crusekin:

De ceaux qui boyvent au sojour

De la cervoise chascun jour:

Mais de la povre gent menour,

Si ce ne soit de leur labour,

Si nâes plus sages au tailler,

Dont ton coutell honir porras.

Du covoitise que luy tient

Triche au sovent ses chars detient,

Qant ne les puet a son voloir

Car tout cela corrupt devient,

Tu as du siecle la noblesce,

Et voes enquore tout du grÃ©

Tout ce te vient du nycetÃ©,

Du couardie et de fieblesce:

Mais si tu fuisses redrescÃ©

De ta malice et ton pecchÃ©,

Car deux biens en puet rescevoir:

Refourmer tout a son voloir;
27210

Lâautre est q

Cil qui bien fait du ciel est hoir:

Dont mâest avis, puisqâensi vait,

Qe lâom

Et lâautre dist, mal se contient

La gent com

La duetÃ© de son estage:

Mais qui du reson soy sovient

Car combien q

Et pour cela je me repens

Par volentÃ© dâamendement,

Mais sur tout je doy consirer,

Et mettre y tout mon desirer

Mais ore je mâaviseray

Et tout cela je changeray,

Envers dieu je supplieray

Qâil de sa grace me convoie;

Ma conscience accuseray,

Un autre chanÃ§on chanteray,

Que jadys chanter ne soloie.

Mais tu qâescoulter me voldras,

Escoulte que je chante bass,

Car câest un chanÃ§on cordial;

<DEDICATION TO KING HENRY THE FOURTH.>

<I> 1.
PitÃ©, prouesse, humblesse, honour roial

Se sont en vous, mon liege seignour, mis

Du providence qâest celestial.

Noz coers dolentz par vous sont rejoÃ¯s;

Par vous, bons Roys, nous susmes enfranchis,

QâainÃ§ois sanz cause fuismes en servage:

Qâen dieu se fie, il ad bel avantage.

2. Qui tient du ciel le regne emperial

Et ad des Rois lâestat en terre assis,

Ceo qâil ad fait de vostre original

Dont vostre honour soit sauf guardÃ© toutdis

De tiel conseil que soit et bon et sage:

Qâen dieu se fie, il ad bel avantage.

Ore en vertu, u lâalme ad son corage:

Qâen dieu se fie, il ad bel avantage.

[Pg 336]

4. O gentils Rois, ce que je vous escris

Ci ensuant ert de perfit langage,

Dont en latin ma sentence ai compris:

Qâen dieu se fie, il ad bel avantage.

O recolende, bone, pie Rex Henrice, patrone,

Ad bona dispone quos eripis a Pharaone;

Noxia depone, quibus est humus hec in agone,

Regni persone quo viuant sub racione;

Pacem compone, vires moderare corone,

Legibus impone frenum sine condicione,

Firmaque sermone iura tenere mone.

Rex confirmatus licet vndique magnificatus,

H. aquile pullus, quo nunquam gracior vllus,

Hostes confregit que tirannica colla subegit:
10

H. aquile cepit oleum, quo regna recepit,

Sic veteri iuncta stipiti noua stirps redit vncta
[O]
.

Nichil proficiet inimicus in eo, et filius iniquitatis non apponet
nocere ei.
Dominus conservet eum, et viuificet eum, et beatum faciat
[P]

eum in terra, et non tradat eum in animam inimicorum eius.

II. 1.
Lâivern sâen vait et lâestÃ©e vient flori,

De froid en chald le temps se muera,

Lâoisel, quâainÃ§ois avoit perdu soun ny,

Le renovelle, u qâil sâesjoiera:
746

De mes amours ensi le monde va,

Par tiel espoir je me conforte ades;

Et vous, ma dame, croietz bien cela,

Quant dolour vait, les joies vienont pres.

2. Ma doulce dame, ensi come jeo vous di,

Saver poetz coment moun coer esta,
10

Le quel vous serve et long temps ad servi,

Tant com jeo vive et toutditz servira:

Remembretz vous, ma dame, pour cela

Qâa moun voloir ne vous lerrai jammes;

Ensi com dieus le voet, ensi serra,

Quant dolour vait, les joies vienont pres.

3. Le jour qe jâai de vous novelle oÃ¯,
747

Il mâest avis qe rien me grievera:

Porceo, ma chiere dame, jeo vous pri,

Par vo message, quant il vous plerra,
20

Mandetz a moi que bon vous semblera,

Du quoi moun coer se poet tenir en pes:

Et pensetz, dame, de ceo qâai dit pieÃ§a,

Quant dolour vait, les joies vienont pres.

4. O noble dame, a vous ce lettre irra,

Et quant dieu plest, jeo vous verrai apres:

Par cest escrit il vous remembrera,

Quant dolour vait, les joies vienont pres.

III. 1. Dâardant desir celle amorouse peigne

MellÃ© dâespoir me fait languir en joie;

Dont par dolÃ§our sovent jeo me compleigne

Pour vous, ma dame, ensi com jeo soloie.

Mais quant jeo pense que vous serretz moie,

De sa justice amour moun coer enhorte,

[Pg 340]

En attendant que jeo me reconforte.

2. La renomÃ©e, dont jâai lâoreile pleine,

De vo valour moun coer pensant envoie

Milfoitz le jour, u tielement me meine,

10

Qâil mâest avis que jeo vous sente et voie,

Plesante, sage, belle, simple et coie:

Si en devient ma joie ades plus forte,
749

En attendant que jeo me reconforte.
750

3. Por faire honour a dame si halteigne

A toutz les jours sanz departir me ploie;

Et si dieus voet que jeo le point atteigne

De mes amours, que jeo desire et proie,

Lors ai dâamour tout ceo qâavoir voldroie:

Mais pour le temps espoir moun coer supporte,
20

En attendant que jeo me reconforte.
750

4. A vous, ma dame, ensi come faire doie,

En lieu de moi ceo lettre vous apporte;

Qâen vous amer moun coer dist toute voie,

En attendant que jeo me reconforte.
750

IIII. 1.
Dâentier voloir sanz jammes departir,

Ma belle, a vous, en qui jâai mâesperance,

En droit amour moun coer sâad fait unir

As toutz jours mais, pour faire vo plesance:

Jeo vous asseur par fine covenance,

Sur toutes autres neez en ceste vie

Vostre amant sui et vous serrez mâamie.

2. Jeo me doi bien a vous soul consentir

Et doner qanque jâai de bienvuillance;

Car pleinement en vous lâen poet sentir
10

BealtÃ©, bountÃ©, valour et sufficaunce:

Croietz moi, dame, et tenetz ma fiaunce,

Qe par doulÃ§our et bone compaignie

Vostre amant sui et vous serretz mâamie.

[Pg 341]

3. De pluis en pluis pour le tresgrant desir

Qe jâai de vous me vient la remembrance

Qâen mon pensant me fait tant rejoÃ¯r,

Qe si le mond fuist tout en ma puissance,

Jeo ne querroie avoir autre alliance:

Tenetz certain qe ceo ne faldra mie,
20

Vostre amant sui et vous serretz mâamie.

4. Au flour des flours, u toute ma creance

Dâamour remaint sanz nulle departie,

Ceo lettre envoie, et croi me sanz doubtance,

Vostre amant sui et vous serretz mâamie.

Doit par reson avoir loenge et pris,

Lors sui dâamour si finement espris,

Dont maintenant mâestoet soeffrir la peine

Come plus la prie; et si jeo mot ne dis,

Qe valt ce, lors qe jeo ma dolour meine
10

De ceo dont jeo ma dame nâai requis?

Ensi de deux jeo sui tant entrepris,

Et si mâen tais, jeo voi la mort procheine.

[Pg 350]

3. Mais si pitÃ©s, qui les douls coers enseine,

2. Soubtz vo constreignte et soubtz vo governance

Dâamour la meindre chose qe jeo sai.

Om dist, poi valt service qâest sanz fÃ©e;

Mais ja pour tant ma dame ne lerray,

Qâa lui servir mâai tout abandonÃ©.

3. Ma dame, qui sciet langage a plentÃ©e,

Et sâensi soit qâelle ait a moi parlÃ©e,

Dâun mot soulein lors sa response orrai,

Qe ma parole est sanz vertu volage,

Et sanz exploit, sicom frivole au vent,

Pour atrapper un tiel oisel en cage.
776

4. Ma dame, en qui toute ma grace attent,

Qe jeo nâai sens, reson nâentendement,

Pour atrapper un tiel oisel en cage.

Car as toutz jours la troeve dâun reles,

Au solail, qe les herbes eslumine

Et fait florir, jeo fai comparisoun

Mon coer, mon corps, mes sens et ma resoun

Par fin amour trestout a sa bandoun:

Si menerai par tant joiouse vie,

Sanz mal penser dâascune vilenie.

2. Si femme porroit estre celestine

De char humeine a la creacion,
10

Jeo croi bien qe ma dame soit devine;

Qâelle ad le port et la condicion

De si tressainte conversacioun,

Si plein dâonour, si plein de courtoisie,

Qâa lui servir jâai fait ma veneisoun,

Sanz mal penser dâascune vilenie.

De son estat, mais ore au present jour

Jeo sui cheeuz de soudeine aventure

En la sotie, u jeo languis sanz cure,

Ne sai coment jâen puiss avoir socour:

Car ma fortune est en ce cas si dure,

Qâau peine lors si jeo ma regardure

Porrai tenir a veoir la doulÃ§our

De celle en qui jâai mis toute ma cure,

Qâore est ma vie en ris, ore est en plour.

3. Quant puiss mirer la face et la colour

De ma tresdoulce dame et sa feture,

Pour regarder en si tresbeal mirour
778

Jeo sui ravi de joie oultre mesure:
20

Mais tost apres, quant sui soulein, jeo plure,

Ma joie ensi se melle de dolour,

Ne sai quant sui dessoubtz ne quant dessure,

Qâore est ma vie en ris, ore est en plour.

4. A vous, tresbelle et bone creature,

Salvant toutdis lâestat de vostre honour,

Ceo lettre envoie: agardetz lâescripture,

Qâore est ma vie en ris, ore est en plour.

XXIII. 1.
Pour un regard au primere acqueintance,

Quant jeo la bealtÃ© de ma dame vi,

Du coer, du corps trestoute mâobeissance

Lui ai donÃ©, tant sui dâamour ravi:

Du destre main jeo lâai ma foi plevi,

Sur quoi ma dame ad resceu moun hommage,

Com son servant et son loial ami;

A bon houre est qe jeo vi celle ymage.

[Pg 357]

2. Par lui veoir sanz autre sustenance,

Mais qe danger ne me soit anemi,
10

Il mâest avis de toute ma creance

Qâas toutz les jours jeo viveroie ensi:

Et câest tout voir qe jeo lui aime si,

Qe mieulx voldroie morir en son servage,

Qe vivere ailours mill auns loigntain de li:

A bone houre est qe jeo vi celle ymage.

3. De son consail ceo me dist esperance,

Qe quant ma dame averai long temps servi

Et fait son grÃ© dâonour et de plesance,

Lors solonc ceo qe jâaverai deservi
20

Le reguerdoun me serra de merci;

Qâelle est plus noble et franche de corage
779

Qe Maii, quant ad la terre tout flori:

A bon houre est qe jeo vi celle ymage.

4. Ceo dit envoie a vous, ma dame, en qui

La gentilesce et le treshalt parage

Se monstront, dont espoir mâad rejoÃ¯:

A bon houre est qe jeo vi celle ymage.

Jeo quide qe ma dame de sa mein

Mâad deinz le coer escript son propre noun;

Car quant jeo puiss oÃ¯r le chapellein

Sa letanie dire et sa leÃ§oun,

Jeo ne sai nomer autre, si le noun;

Car jâai le coer de fin amour si plein,

Qâen lui gist toute ma devocioun:

Dieus doignt qe jeo ne prie pas en vein!

2. Pour penser les amours de temps longtein,

Com la priere de Pigmalion
10

Faisoit miracle, et lâimage au darrein

De piere en char mua de sâoreisoun,

Jâai graunt espoir de la comparisoun

Qe par sovent prier serrai certein

De grace; et pour si noble reguerdoun

Dieus doignt qe jeo ne prie pas en vein!

[Pg 358]

3. Com cil qui songe et est en nouncertein,

Ainz semble a lui quâil vait tout environ

Et fait et dit, ensi quant sui soulein,

A moi parlant jeo fais maint question,
20

Despute et puis responde a ma resoun,

Ne sai si jeo sui faie ou chose humein:

Tiel est dâamour ma contemplacion;

Dieus doignt qe jeo ne prie pas en vein!

4. A vous, qe mâavetz en subjeccion,

Soul apres dieu si mâestes soverein,

Envoie cette supplicacion:

Dieus doignt qe jeo ne prie pas en vein!

XXV. 1.
Ma dame, si ceo fuist a vo plesir,

Au plus sovent jeo vous visiteroie;
780

Mais le fals jangle et le tresfals conspir

De mesdisantz mâont destorbÃ© la voie,
781

Et vostre honour sur toute riens voldroie:

Par quoi, ma dame, en droit de ma partie

En lieu de moi mon coer a vous envoie;

Car qui bien aime ses amours tard oblie.

2. Ils sont assetz des tiels qui de mentir

Portont le clief pendant a lour curroie;
10

Du quoi, ma dame, jeo ne puiss sentir

Coment aler, ainÃ§ois me torne envoie:

Mais sache dieus, par tout uque jeo soie,

Dâentier voloir sanz nulle departie

A vous me tiens, a vous mon coer se ploie;

Car qui bien aime ses amours tard oblie.

3. De vo presence a long temps abstenir

Grief mâest, en cas qâa force ensi feroie;

Et dâautrepart, si jeo voldrai venir,

Sanz vostre esgard ceo faire ne porroie:
20

Comandetz moi ceo qe jeo faire en doie,
782

Car vous avetz de moi la seignorie,

Tout est en vous, ma dolour et ma joie;

Car qui bien aime ses amours tard oblie.

[Pg 359]

4. As mesdisantz, dont bon amour sâesfroie,

De male langue dieus les motz maldie;

Qâen lour despit a vostre amour mâotroie;

Car qui bien aime ses amours tard oblie.

XXVI. 1.

2. Qui donne soi, câest une experience

Qe lâautre bien ne serront escondit:

Si plein com dieus mâad de sa providence

Fait et formÃ©, si plein sanz contredit

Soul apres lui, ma dame, en fait et dit

Vous donne; et si Rois fuisse dâun Empire,

Tout est a vous: mais en amour perfit

Sanz autre doun le coer doit bien suffire.

3. Primer quant vi lâestat de vo presence,

En vous mirer me vint si grant delit,

Qâunqes depuiss dâascune negligence

Mon coer pensant vostre bealtÃ© nâoublit:
20

Par quoi toutdis me croist celle appetit

De vous amer, plus qe ne porrai dire;

Et pour descrire amour en son droit plit,

Qe nulle medicine mâest verraie,

Si vous nâaidetz; mais certes jeo me paie,

Car soubtz la cure de si bone mein

Meulx vuil languir qe sanz vous estre sein.

2. Amour de sa constreignte est un tirant,

Mais sa banere quant merci desplaie,

Lors est il suef, courtois et confortant:
10

Ceo poet savoir qui la fortune essaie;

Mais combien quâil sa grace me deslaie,

Ma dame, jeo me tiens a vous certein;

Mieulx vuill languir qe sanz vous estre sein.

3. Ensi ne tout guari ne languisant,

Ma dame, soubtz lâespoir de vo manaie

Je vive, et sui vos graces attendant,

Tanque merci ses oignementz attraie,

Et le destroit de ma dolour allaie:

Mais si guaris ne soie enquore au plein,

Mieulx vuill languir qe sanz vous estre sein.

4. Pour vous, qâavetz la bealtÃ© plus qe faie,

Ceo lettre ai fait sanz null penser vilein:

Parentre deus combien qe jeo mâesmaie,

Mieulx vuill languir qe sanz vous estre sein.

Ne quier de vous forsque le coer demi,

Et vous avetz le mien trestout entier:

Om voit sovent de petit poi doner.

2. Les vertus de franchise et de largesce

Jeo sai, ma dame, en vous sont establi;

Et vous savetz ma peine et ma destresce,
10

Dont par dolour jeo sui sempres faili

[Pg 361]

En le defalte soul de vo merci,

Qâil ne vous plest un mot a moi mander:

Om voit sovent de petit poi doner.

3. Tout qanque jâai, ma dame, a vo noblesce

De coer et corps jeo lâai donÃ© parmi;

Par quoi ne vous desplese, en ma simplesce

De vostre amour si jeo demande ensi;

Car cil qui done il ad doun deservi,

Quant le danger de vo parole orra;

Le Nief qe vostre bouche soufflera

Me fait sigler sur le peril de vie:

Qâest en danger, falt quâil merci supplie.

2. Rois Uluxes, sicom nous dist la geste,

Vers son paiis de Troie qui sigla,

Quant les Sereines en la Mier passa,

Et le danger de Circes eschapa,
785

Qe le paour nâest plus de ma partie:

Qâest en danger, falt quâil merci supplie.

3. Danger, qui tolt dâamour toute la feste,

Unqes un mot de confort ne sona;

Ainz plus cruel qe nâest la fiere beste,

Au point quant danger me respondera,

La chiere porte, et quant le nai dirra,

Plus que la mort mâestone celle oÃ¯e:

Et ceo me fait vostre amour desirer

Secondement apres lâamour divine,

Pour chier tenir, servir et honourer;

Car bon amour a les vertus encline.

3. Et si la sort de grace est amourouse,

Lors porrai bien, ma dame, tesmoigner,

Vo grace entre la gent est si famouse,

Qâa quelle part qe jeo me vuil torner,

Jeo puiss oÃ¯r vo grace proclamer:

Toutz en parlont et diont lour covine,

Ne puis veoir de grace ascun semblant,

Câest une dure et forte retenue;

Au fals amant, quant il dâamour sâaqueinte;

Sa loialtÃ© pleine est des falsetÃ©s,

Plustost deÃ§oit, quant il se fait plus queinte:
801

A toi le di, qâas trahi femme meinte,

Ceo qâas mespris restorer ne poetz,

Et pourcella, de ta falsine atteinte

Si tu voldras briser lâestrein, brisetz.

2. Trop tard conu mâest ceo qe fait avetz,

Qe mâas hostÃ© de toi par tiele empeinte,
10

Qe jammais jour ne serrai retournetz

Pour obeÃ¯r nâa toi nâa ta constreignte.
802

He, fals amis, com ta parole est feinte!

Les viels promesses toutes sont quassetz,

Trop as en toi la gentilesce exteinte:

Si tu voldras briser lâestrein, brisetz.

3. O tu, mirour des mutabilitÃ©es,

Des fals amantz en toi lâimage est peinte,

Tes sens se muent en subtilitÃ©es,

Sil qâensi fait nâad pas la vie seinte.
20

Tu as derrour la conscience enceinte,

Dont fraude et malengin sont engendrez;

Tu as vers moi ta loialtÃ© si freinte,

Si tu voldras briser lâestrein, brisetz.

4. En les malvois malice nâest restreignte,

Tu nâen serras de ta part escusez;

As toutz amantz jeo fais ceste compleignte:

Si tu voldras briser lâestrein, brisetz.

XLIII. 1.
Plus tricherous qe Jason a MedÃ©e,
803

A Deianire ou qâErcules estoit,
804

Plus qâEneas, qâavoit Dido lessÃ©e,
805

Plus qe TheseÃ¼s, qâAdriagne amoit,

Ou Demephon, quant Phillis oublioit,

Je trieus, helas, qâamer jadis soloie:

Dont chanterai desore en mon endroit,

Câest ma dolour, qe fuist ainÃ§ois ma joie.

[Pg 372]

2. Unqes Ector, qâama PantasilÃ©e,

En tiele haste a Troie ne sâarmoit,
10

Qe tu tout nud nâes deinz le lit couchÃ©,

Amis as toutes, quelqe venir doit,

Ne poet chaloir, mais qâune femne y soit;

Si es comun plus qe la halte voie.

Helas, qe la fortune me deÃ§oit,

Câest ma dolour, qe fuist ainÃ§ois ma joie,

3. De Lancelot si fuissetz remembrÃ©,

Et de Tristrans, com il se contenoit,

Generides, Florent, PartonopÃ©,
806

Chascun de ceaux sa loialtÃ© guardoit.
20

Mais tu, helas, qâest ceo qe te forsvoit

De moi, qâa toi jammais null jour falsoie?

Tu es a large et jeo sui en destroit,

Câest ma dolour, qe fuist ainÃ§ois ma joie.

4. Des toutz les mals tu qâes le plus maloit,

Ceste compleignte a ton oraille envoie;

SantÃ© me laist et langour me reÃ§oit,

Câest ma dolour, qe fuist ainÃ§ois ma joie.

XLIIII. 1.
Vailant, courtois, gentil et renomÃ©e,

Loial, verrai, certain de vo promesse,

Vous mâavetz vostre corps et coer donnÃ©,

Qe jeo resÃ§oive et prens a grant leesce.

Si jeo de Rome fuisse lâemperesse,

Vostre ameistÃ© refuserai jeo mie,

Qâau tiel ami jeo vuill bien estre amie.

2. La halte fame qe lâen mâad recontÃ©e

De vo valour et de vo grant prouesse

De joie mâad lâoreille trespercÃ©e,
10

Et confortÃ© le coer, siqâen destresce

Ne puiss languir, ainz de vo gentilesce

Pour remembrer sui des toutz mals guarie;

Qâau tiel ami jeo vuil bien estre amie.

3. Et puisqâil est ensi de veritÃ©,

Qe lâameistÃ© de vous vers moi se dresce,

Le coer de moi vers vous sâest adrescÃ©e

[Pg 373]

De bien amer par droite naturesce.

Tresdouls amis, tenetz ma foi expresse,

Ceo point dâacord tendrai toute ma vie,
20

Qâau tiel ami jeo vuill bien estre amie.

4. Par loialtÃ©, confort, chiertÃ©, tendresce,

Ceste ma lettre, quoique nulls en die,
807

Ove tout le coer envoie a vo noblesce;

Qâau tiel ami jeo vuill bien estre amie.

XLV. 1.
Ma dame, jeo vous doi bien comparer

Au cristall, qe les autres eslumine;

Car celle piere qui la poet toucher

De sa vertu reÃ§oit sa medicine,

Si en devient plus preciouse et fine:
808

Ensi pour vo bountÃ© considerer

Toutz les amantz se porront amender.

2. Vostre figure auci pour deviser,

La chiere avetz et belle et femeline,

Du quelle, qant jeo me puiss aviser,
10

Jeo sui constreint, ensi com de famine,

Pour vous amer de tiele discipline,

Dont mâest avis qe pour vous essampler

Toutz les amantz se porront amender.

3. El Cristall dame om porra bien noter

Deux propretÃ©s semblable a vo covine:

Le Cristall est de soi et blanc et clier;

Dieus et nature ensi par double line

Vous ont de lâun et lâautre fait saisine:

Par quoi des biens qe vous avetz pleiner
20

Toutz les amantz se porront amender.

4. Ceste balade, dame, a vous encline

Envoie pour vos graces commender:

De vostre essample et de vostre doctrine

Toutz les amantz se porront amender.

[Pg 374]

XLVI. 1.
En resemblance dâaigle, qui surmonte

Toute autre oisel pour voler au dessure,

Tresdouls amis, vostre amour tant amonte

Sur toutz amantz, par quoi jeo vous assure

De bien amer, sauf toutdis la mesure

De mon honour, le quell jeo guarderai:

Si parler nâose, ades jeo penserai.

2. Par les paiis la fame vole et conte

Coment prouesce est toute en vostre cure,

Et quant jeo puiss oÃ¯r si noble conte
10

De vo valour, jeo met toute ma cure,

A mon poair dont vostre honour procure:

Mais pour les gentz tresbien mâaviserai;

Si parler nâose, ades jeo penserai.

3. Entre nous dames, quant mettons a la compte

Vo noble port et vo fiere estature,

Lors en deviens un poi rugge pour honte,
809

Mais jeo le torne ensi par envoisure,

Qâaparcevoir null poet la coverture:

Par tiel colour en joie jeo mâesmai;
20

Si parler nâose, ades jeo penserai.

4. A vous, qâavetz dâonour celle aventure,

Qe vos valours toutz passont a lâessai,

Droitz est qâamour vous rende sa droiture:

Si parler nâose, ades jeo penserai.

XLVII. 1.
Li corps se tient par manger et par boire,

Et fin amour le coer fait sustenir,

Mais plus dâassetz est digne la memoire

De vrai amour, qui le sciet maintenir:

Pourceo, ma dame, a vous me vuill tenir,

De tiel amour qe ja ne falsera:

Nâest pas oiceus sil qui bien amera.

2. Des tiels y ad qui sont dâamour en gloire,

Par quoi li coers se poet bien rejoÃ¯r;

Des tiels y ad qui sont en purgatoire,
10

Qe mieulx lour fuist assetz de mort morir;

[Pg 375]

Ascuns dâespoir ont pris le vein desir,

Dont sanz esploit lâamant souhaidera:

Nâest pas oiceus sil qui bien amera.

3. De fin amour qui voet savoir lâistoire,

Il falt qâil sache et bien et mal suffrir;

Plus est divers qe lâen ne porra croire:

Et nepourquant ne mâen puiss abstenir,

Ainz me covient amer, servir, cherir

La belle en qui moun coer sojournera:
20

Nâest pas oiceus sil qui bien amera.

4. Demi parti de joie et de suspir

Ceste balade a vous, ma dame, irra;

Qâen la santÃ© dâamour mâestoet languir:

Nâest pas oiceus sil qui bien amera.

XLVIII. 1.
Amour est une chose merveilouse,

Dont nulls porra savoir le droit certein;

Amour de soi est la foi tricherouse,

Qe plus promette et meinz apporte au mein;
810

Le riche est povere et le courtois vilein,

Lâespine est molle et la rose est urtie:

En toutz errours amour se justefie.

2. Lâamier est douls et la doulÃ§our merdouse,
811

Labour est ease et le repos grievein,

Le doel plesant, la seurtÃ© perilouse,
10

Le halt est bass, si est le bass haltein,
812

Qant lâen mieulx quide avoir, tout est en vein,

Le ris en plour, le sens torne en folie

En toutz errours amour se justefie.

3. Amour est une voie dangereuse,

Le pres est loign, et loign remaint proschein;

Amour est chose odible et graciouse,

Orguil est humble et service est desdeign,

Lâaignelle est fiere et le leon humein,

Lâoue est en cage, la merle est forsbanie:
813

20

En toutz errours amour se justifie.

[Pg 376]

4. Ore est amour salvage, ore est soulein,

Nâest qui dâamour poet dire la sotie;

Amour est serf, amour est soverein;

En toutz errours amour se justifie.
814

XLIX. 1.
As bons est bon et a les mals malvois
815

Amour, qui des natures est regent;

Mais lâomme qui de reson ad le pois,

Cil par reson doit amer bonement:

Car qui deinz soi sanz mal penser comprent

De bon amour la veritÃ© pleinere,

Lors est amour dâonour la droite miere.

2. Bon amour doit son dieu amer ainÃ§ois,

Qui son dieu aime il aime verraiment,

Si ad de trois amours le primer chois;
10

Et apres dieu il doit secondement

Amer son proesme a soi semblablement;

Car cil qâensi voet guarder la maniere,

Lors est amour dâonour la droite miere.

3. Le tierce point dont amour ad la vois,

Amour en son endroit ceo nous aprent

Soubtz matrimoine de les seintes lois,

Par vie honeste et nonpas autrement.

En ces trois pointz gist tout lâexperiment
816

De boun amour, et si jâensi le quiere,
20

Lors est amour dâonour la droite miere.

4. De bon amour, pour prendre avisement,

Jeo vous ai dit la forme et la matiere;

Car quique voet amer honestement,

Lors est amour dâonour la droite miere.

L. 1.
De vrai honour est amour tout le chief,

Qui le corage et le memorial

Des bones mours fait guarder sanz meschief:

De lâaverous il fait franc et loial,

Et de vilein courtois et liberal,

[Pg 377]

Et de couard plus fiers qe nâest leoun;
817

De lâenvious il hoste tout le mal:

Amour sâacorde a nature et resoun.

2. Ceo qâainz fuist aspre, amour le tempre suef,

Si fait du guerre pes, et est causal
10

Dont toute vie honeste ad soun relief.

Sibien les choses qe sont natural,

Com celles qe sont dâomme resonal,

Amour par tout sa jurediccioun

Claime a tenir, et par especial

Amour sâacorde a nature et resoun.

3. Au droit amant riens est pesant ne grief,

Dont conscience en soun judicial

Forsvoit, mais li malvois plus qe la Nief

Est en tempeste, et ad son governal
20

Dâonour perdu; sique du pois egual

La fortune est et la condicioun

De lâomme, et sur tout le plus cordial

Amour sâacorde a nature et resoun.

4. Nâest qui dâamour poet dire le final;

Mais en droit moi câest la conclusioun,

Qui voet dâonour sercher lâoriginal,

Amour sâacorde a nature et reson.

<LI.> 1.
Amour de soi est bon en toute guise,

Si resoun le governe et justifie;

Mais autrement, sâil naist de fole emprise,

Nâest pas amour, ainz serra dit sotie.

Avise soi chascuns de sa partie,

Car ma resoun de novell acqueintance

Mâad fait amer dâamour la plus cherie
818

Virgine et miere, en qui gist ma creance.

2. As toutes dames jeo doi moun servise

Abandoner par droite courtasie,
10

Mais a ma dame pleine de franchise

Pour comparer nâest une en ceste vie.

Qui voet amer ne poet faillir dâamie,

[Pg 378]

Car perdurable amour sanz variance

Remaint en luy, com celle qâest florie
819

De bien, dâonour, de joie et de plesance.

3. De tout mon coer jeo lâaime et serve et prise,

Et amerai sanz nulle departie;

Par quoi jâespoir dâavoir ma rewardise,

Pour quelle jeo ma dame ades supplie:
20

Câest, qant mon corps lerra la compaignie

De mâalme, lors lui deigne en remembrance

Dâamour doner a moi le pourpartie,

Dont puiss avoir le ciel en heritance.

O gentile Engleterre, a toi jâescrits,

Pour remembrer ta joie qâest novelle,

Qe te survient du noble Roi Henris,

Par qui dieus ad redrescÃ© ta querele:

A dieu purceo prient et cil et celle,

Qâil de sa grace au fort Roi coronÃ©

Doignt peas, honour, joie et prosperitÃ©.

Expliciunt carmina Iohannis Gower, que Gallice composita Balades dicuntur.

[Pg 379]

TRAITIÃ
820

Puisquâil
822
ad dit ci devant en Englois par voie dâessample la
sotie de cellui
823
qui par amours aime par especial, dirra ore apres en
FranÃ§ois
824
a tout le monde en general un
825
traitiÃ© selonc les auctours
pour essampler les amantz marietz, au fin qâils la foi
826
de lour seintes
espousailes pourront
827
par fine loialtÃ© guarder, et al honour de dieu
salvement tenir.

Qualiter creator omnium rerum deus hominem duplicis nature,
ex anima racionali et humana carne, in principio nobilem creauit; et
qualiter anima ex sue
creacionis priuilegio super corpus dominium
possidebit.
821

I. 1.
Le creatour de toute creature,

Qui lâalme dâomme ad fait a son ymage,

Par quoi le corps de reson et nature

Soit attemprÃ© per jouste governage,

Il done al alme assetz plus dâavantage;

Car il lâad fait discrete et resonable,

Dont sur le corps raison ert conestable.
828

2. En dieu amer celle alme ad sa droiture,

Tant soulement pour fermer le corage

En tiel amour u nulle mesprisure
10

De foldelit la poet mettre en servage

De frele char, qâest toutdis en passage:
829

[Pg 380]

Mais la bone alme est seinte et permanable;

Dont sur le corps raison ert conestable.
830

3. En lâalme gist et raison et mesure,
831

Dont elle avera le ciel en heritage;

Li corps selonc la char pour engendrure

Avera la bone espouse en mariage;

Qui sont tout une chose et un estage,

Qe lâun a lâautre soient entendable:
20

Dont sur le corps raison ert conestable.

Qualiter spiritus, vt celum impleatur, castitatem
affectat, et corpus, vt genus humanum in terra multiplicetur, coniugii copulam
carnaliter concupiscit.

II. 1.
De lâespirit lâamour quiert continence,

Et vivre chaste en soul dieu contemplant;

Li corps par naturele experience

Quiert femme avoir, dont soit multipliant;

Des bones almes lâun fait le ciel preignant,

Et lâautre emplist la terre de labour:

Si lâun est bon, lâautre est assetz meilour.

2. A lâespirit qui fait la providence

Ne poet failir de reguerdon suiant.
832

Plus est en lâalme celle intelligence,
10

Dont sanz null fin lâomme en serra vivant,
833

Qe nâest le corps en ses fils engendrant;

Et nepourqant tout fist le creatour:
834

Si lâun est bon, lâautre est assetz meilour.

3. A lâespirit dieus dona conscience,

Par quelle om ert du bien et mal sachant.

Le corps doit pas avoir la reverence,

Ainz ert a lâalme et humble et obeissant;

Mais dieus, qui les natures vait creant,

Et lâun et lâautre ad mis en son atour:
20

Si lâun est bon, lâautre est assetz meilour.

[Pg 381]

Qualiter virginalis
castitas in gradu suo
matrimonio prefertur:
ambo tamen sub sacre
conversacionis disciplina
deo creatori
placabilia constitunt.

III. 1.
Au plus parfit dieus ne nous obligea,
835

Mais il voet bien qe nous soions parfitz.

Cist homme a dieu sa chastetÃ© dona,

Et cist en dieu voet estre bons maritz:
836

Sâil quiert avoir espouse a son avis,
837

Il plest a dieu de faire honeste issue

Selonc la loi de seinte eglise due.
838

2. Primerement qant mesmes dieus crea
839

Adam et Eve en son saint paradis,

Lâomme ove la femme ensemble maria,
10

Dont ait la terre en lour semense emplis:

Lors fuist au point celle espousaile empris

Du viele loi, et puis, qant fuist venue,

Selonc la loi de seinte eglise due.
840

3. Et puisque dieus qui la loi ordina

En une char ad deux persones mis,

Droitz est qe lâomme et femme pourcela

Tout un soul coer eiont par tiel devis,

Loiale amie avoec loials amis:

Câest en amour trop belle retenue
20

Selonc la loi de seinte eglise due.
841

Qualiter honestas
coniugii non ex libidinis
842

aut auaricie

quod sub lege

IV. 1.
Ovesque amour qant loialtÃ© sâaqueinte,
843

Lors sont les noeces bones et joiouses;

Mais li guilers, qant il se fait plus queinte,
844

Par falssemblant les fait sovent doubtouses,

A lâoill qant plus resemblont amorouses:

Câest ensi come de stouppes une corde,
845

Qant le penser a son semblant descorde.

2. Celle espousaile est assetz forte et seinte,

Dâamour u sont les causes vertuouses:

Si lâespousaile est dâavarice enceinte,
10

Et qe les causes soient tricherouses,

[Pg 382]

Ja ne serront les noeces graciouses;

Car conscience toutdis se remorde,

Qant le penser a son semblant descorde.

3. Honest amour, qâove loialtÃ© sâaqueinte,
846

Fait qe les noeces serront gloriouses;

Et qui son coer ad mis par tiele empeinte,

Nâestoet doubter les changes perilouses.

Om dist qe noeces sont aventurouses;

Car la fortune en tiel lieu ne sâaccorde,
847

20

Qant le penser a son semblant descorde.

Qualiter matrimonii
sacramentum, quod ex
duorum mutuo consensu
sub fidei iuramento

propter diuine
vindicte offensam euitandam
nullatenus dissolui
debet.

V. 1.
Grant mervaile est et trop contre reson,
848

Qâom doit du propre chois sa femme eslire,

Et puis confermer celle eleccion
849

Par espousaile, et puis apres desdire

Sa foi, qant il de jour en jour desire

Novell amour assetz plus qe la beste:

Sa foi mentir nâest pas a lâomme honeste.

2. De lâespousailes la profession

Valt plus dâassetz qe jeo ne puiss descrire:

Soubtz cell habit prist incarnacion
10

De la virgine cil qâest nostre Sire:

Par quoi, des toutes partz qui bien remire,

En lâordre de si tresseintisme geste
850

Sa foi mentir nâest pas a lâomme honeste.

3. De lâespousailes celle beneiÃ§oun
851

Le sacrement de seinte eglise enspire:
852

Câest un liens, sanz dissolucioun
853

Qâom doit guarder; car quique voldra lisre

Le temps passÃ©, il avera cause a dire,

Pour doubte de vengeance et de moleste,
854

20

Sa foi mentir nâest pas a lâomme honeste.

[Pg 383]

Nota hic contra
illos qui nuper sponsalia

qui postea patrem

VI. 1.
Nectanabus, qui vint en Macedoine

DâEgipte, u quâil devant ot rois estÃ©,

Olimpeas encontre matrimoine,

Lâespouse au roi Philipp, ad violÃ©,

Dont Alisandre estoit lors engendrÃ©:

Mais quoique soit du primere envoisure,

Le fin demoustre toute lâaventure.
855

2. Cil qâest de pecchÃ© pres sa grace esloigne:
856

Ceo parust bien, car tiele destinÃ©e
857

Avint depuis, qe sanz nulle autre essoine
858

10

Le fils occist le pere tout de grÃ©e.
859

Ore esgardetz coment fuist revengÃ©

Dâavolterie celle forsfaiture:

Le fin demoustre toute lâaventure.
855

Qualiter Vluxes
Penolope sponsus in
insula Cilli Circen
ibidem reginam adulterando

3. Rois Uluxes pour plaire a sa caroigne

Falsoit sa foi devers PenolopÃ©;

Avoec Circes fist mesme la busoigne,

Du quoi son fils Thelogonus fuist nÃ©e,
860

Qâad puis son propre piere auci tuÃ©.

Qâil nâest plesant a dieu tiele engendrure,
20

Le fin demoustre toute lâaventure.
855

Qualiter Hercules,
qui Deianiram regis
Calidonie filiam desponsauit,

Vnde

VII. 1.
El grant desert dâYnde superiour

Cil qui dâarein les deux pilers fichoit,
862

Danz Hercules, prist femme a son honour

Qe file au roi de Calidoine estoit;
863

Contre Achelons en armes conquestoit

La belle Deianire par bataille.
864

Câest grant peril de freindre lâespousaile.

2. Bien tost apres tout changea cell amour
865

Pour Eolen, dont il sâespouse haoit:

Celle Eolen fuist file a lâemperour
866

10

DâEurice, et Herculem tant assotoit,

Qâelle ot de lui tout ceo qâavoir voloit.

Nâert pas le fin semblable au comensaile;

[Pg 384]

Câest grant peril de freindre lâespousaile.

3. Unqes ne fuist ne ja serra null jour,

Qe tiel pecchÃ© de dieu vengÃ© ne soit:
867

Car Hercules, ensi com dist lâauctour,

Dâune chemise, dont il se vestoit,

Fuist tant deceu, quâil soi mesmes ardoit.
868

De son mesfait porta le contretaille;
869

20

Câest grant peril de freindre lâespousaile.

Qualiter Iason vxorem

Freinte espousaile dieus le vengera.

2. Qant Medea meulx quide estre en repos

Ove son mari, et qâelle avoit portÃ©

872

10

El quel Jason primer fuist obligÃ©:

Si prist la file au roi Creon Creusa.

Freinte espousaile dieux le vengera.

3. Medea, qâot le coer de dolour clos,

Qant lâautre fol lerra sa fole amie!

Nâest pas amant qui son amour mesguie.

Lâamour parfit en dieu se justifie.

Quis sit vel qualis sacer ordo connubialis

Scripsi, mentalis sit amor quod in ordine talis.

Exemplo veteri poterunt ventura timeri;

Cras caro sicut heri leuiter valet illa moueri.

Non ita gaudebit sibi qui de carne placebit,

Quin corpus flebit aut spiritus inde dolebit:

Carne refrenatus qui se regit inmaculatus,

[Pg 392]

Omnes quosque status precellit in orbe beatus,

Ille deo gratus splendet ad omne latus.

Carmen de variis in amore passionibus breuiter compilatum.
966

Est amor in glosa pax bellica, lis pietosa,

Accio famosa, vaga sors, vis imperiosa,

Pugna quietosa, victoria perniciosa,

Regula viscosa, scola deuia, lex capitosa,

Cura molestosa, grauis ars, virtus viciosa,

Gloria dampnosa, flens risus et ira iocosa,

Musa dolorosa, mors leta, febris preciosa,

Esca venenosa, fel dulce, fames animosa,

Vitis acetosa, sitis ebria, mens furiosa,

Flamma pruinosa, nox clara, dies tenebrosa,
967

10

Res dedignosa, socialis et ambiciosa,

Garrula, verbosa, secreta, silens, studiosa,

Fabula formosa, sapiencia prestigiosa,

Causa ruinosa, rota versa, quies operosa,

Vrticata rosa, spes stulta fidesque dolosa.

Magnus in exiguis, variatus vt est tibi clamor,

Fixus in ambiguis motibus errat amor:

Instruat audita tibi leccio sic repetita;

Mors, amor et vita participantur ita.

Lex docet auctorum quod iter carnale bonorum

Tucius est, quorum sunt federa coniugiorum:

Fragrat vt ortorum rosa plus quam germen agrorum,

Ordo maritorum caput est et finis amorum:

Hec est nuptorum carnis quasi regula morum,
5

Que saluandorum sacratur in orbe virorum.

Hinc vetus annorum Gower sub spe meritorum
968

Ordine sponsorum tutus adhibo thorum.

NOTES

MIROUR DE LâOMME

Table of Contents.
âThis table is written in a hand which
differs somewhat from that of the text, and it has some peculiar forms
of spelling, as âdiable,â âeyde,â âpor,â ânoet,â âfraunchement,â
âfraunchise,â âgovernaunce,â âsount,â âlesserountâ: some of these forms
are also found in the rubrics.

After the Table four leaves have been cut out, and the first leaf
that we have of the text is signed
a
iiii. It is probable that
the first of the lost leaves was something like
f. 6
in the
Glasgow MS. of the
Vox Clamantis
, which is blank on one side
and has a picture and some verses on the other (being, as this is, a
half-sheet left over after the Table of Contents), and that the text of
the
Mirour
began with the first quire of eight (
a
i). If
this is so, three leaves of the text are missing, probably containing
forty-seven stanzas, i.e. 564 lines, an allowance of twelve lines of
space being made for title and rubrics. The real subject of the book
begins at l. 37 of the existing text, as will be seen by the rubric
there, and what preceded was probably a prologue dealing with the
vanity of worldly and sinful pleasures: see ll. 25-30.

1.
Escoulte cea
&c. This is addressed to lovers of sin and of
the world, not to lovers in the ordinary sense, as we shall see if we
read the first stanzas carefully.

2.
perestes
: see âperestreâ in Glossary. The 3rd pers. sing.
âperestâ is fully written out in the MS. several times, e.g. 1760, 2546.

4.
ove tout sâenfant
, âtogether with her children,â âsâenfantâ
(for âsi enfantâ) being plural. For âove toutâ cp. 27662,

âLe piere et miere ove tout lâenfant,â

where âlâenfantâ is singular. This shows that âove toutâ should be
combined, and not âtout sâenfant.â For other adverbial uses of âtoutâ
see Glossary. âOveâ counts always as a monosyllable in the verse, and
so also âcomeâ: see l. 28.

6.
chapeal de sauls
, the wreath of willow being a sign of
mourning.

[Pg 394]

23.
Changeast
: pret. subjunctive for conditional, a very common
use with our author.

25.
porroit
: conditional used for pret. subjunctive, cp. 170,
322,
Bal.
i. 3, &c.

28.
come
, also written âcommeâ and âcom,â has always, like
âove,â the value of a monosyllable in the metre.

31.
lâamour seculer
, âthe love of the world.â

37.
ore
, counting as a monosyllable here, cp. 1775, &c., but as
a dissyllable 4737, 11377,
Bal.
xxviii. 1.

39.
fait anientir
, âannihilatesâ: see note on 1135.

46.
Que
, âFor.â

51. The reference is to John i. 3 f., âOmnia per ipsum facta sunt: et
sine ipso factum est nihil, quod factum est. In ipso vita erat,â &c.
This was usually taken with a full stop after ânihil,â and then âQuod
factum est in ipso, vita erat.â It was read so by Augustine, who seems
to suggest the idea which is attributed below to Gregory, viz. that
the ânothingâ which was made without God was
sin
. âPeccatum
quidem non per ipsum factum est; et manifestum est quia peccatum nihil
est,â &c.,
Joann. Evang.
i. 13. Gregory also held that sin was
nothing: âRes quidem aliquid habet esse, peccatum vero esse nullum
habet,â i.
Reg. Exp.
v. 14, but I do not know whether he founded
his opinion specially on this text. Pierre de Peccham expresses the
same idea:

âPecchÃ© nâest chose ne nature

Ne si nâest la deu creature,

Einz est de nature corrupciun

Et defaute et destructiun,â &c.

M.S. Bodl. 399, f. 21 v
o
.

65.
de les celestieux
, âfrom heaven,â cp. 27120, and such expressions
as âles infernalxâ just below.

74.
tout plein
, âa great numberâ: often written as one word
âtoutplein,â so, for example,
Bal.
xxxvii. 2,
Mir.
25276 &c.;
divided as here l. 11021.

83.
au droit divis
, ârightly,â an adverbial expression which is
often used by our author to fill up a line: cp. 872 and Glossary under
âdevis.â

84.
du dame Evein
, âin the person of Eveâ: âduâ for âde,â see
Glossary.

85. For this kind of repetition cp. 473 and
Conf. Am. Prol.
60, âSo
as I can, so as I mai.â

89. The sentence is broken off and resumed under another form: cp. 997
ff., 17743, &c., and
Conf. Am.
vi. 1796 ff.

94.
qâestoit perdue
, âthat which was lost.â The form
perdue
is not
influenced by gender but by rhyme.

100. For the position of âetâ see note on 415.

115.
avoit
, âthere was,â for ây avoitâ: so used frequently.

116.
luy
, a form of
ly
,
le
, see Glossary.

118.
nâen fuist mangant
, âshould not eat of them.â This use of pres.
participle with auxiliary instead of the simple tense is frequent
not only with our author but in old French generally: see Burguy,

Grammaire
ii. 258.

131.
a qui constance
&c., because of her nature as a woman.

135.
u que
, âwhereâ: sometimes combined into âuque,â âuqe,â e.g.

Bal.
xv. 3, but usually separate.

136.
deable
, also written âdeble,â and never more than a dissyllable
in the metre.

139.
en ton endroit
, âfor your part.â Phrases composed with âendroitâ
or âen droitâ are among the commonest forms of âfill upâ employed by
our author: cp. note on l. 83, and see Glossary under âendroit.â

163. Cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 1610, âFor what womman is
so above
.â

168.
le fist ... forsjuger
, âcondemned him,â see note on 1135.

170.
serroit
: conditional for subjunctive, cp. l. 25.

190.
Ce dont
, âthe cause whereby.â

194. Note that the capital letters of âPecchÃ©,â âMort,â âChar,â âAlme,â
âSiecle,â indicating that they are spoken of as persons, are due to the
editor.

217 ff.
Tant perservoit ... dont il fuist
&c. This use of âdontâ
(instead of âqueâ), after such words as âtant,â âsi,â &c., to introduce
the consequence, is very common with our author, see 544, 657, &c., cp.
682. Compare the similar use of the relative in English, e.g.
Conf.
Am.
i. 498. Here there is a second consecutive clause following, which
is introduced by âQueâ: âHis daughter so kept him in pleasant mood and
made him such entertainment that he was enamoured of her so much that,â
&c.

218.
en son degrÃ©
, âfor her partâ: cp. note on 139.

230.
vont ... engendrant
, equivalent to âengendrent,â another
instance of the use of pres. partic. with auxiliary verbs for the
simple tense, which is common in old French: cp. 118, 440, 500, and the
conclusion of this stanza, where we have âserray devisantâ and âest
nomantâ for âdeviseraiâ and ânomme.â

238 ff. âAs I will describe to you, (telling) by what names people call

253.
celle dâAvarice
, âthat which is called Avarice.â For this
apposition with âdeâ cp. 84, 14197.

276.
grantment
: corrected here and in 397 from âgrantement,â which
would be three syllables. We have âgrantmentâ 8931.

296.
Accidie.
This counts as three syllables only in the metre, and
it is in fact written âAccideâ in l. 255. A similar thing is to be
observed in several other words with this ending, as âVituperieâ 2967,
âfamilieâ 3916, âcontumelieâ 4067, âperjurieâ 6409, âencordieâ 6958,
âremedieâ 10912, âpluvieâ 26716; and in general, when the accent fell
on the antepenultimate, there was a tendency to run the
-ie
into one
syllable. The accent, however, was variable (at least in Anglo-Norman)
according to the exigences of metre, and in some cases where we should
expect the above rule to apply we find the accent thrown on the
penultimate and all the syllables fully sounded, as 2362,

âContumacie lâoi nommer.â

[Pg 396]

301.
ceos mals
: equivalent to âles mals,â so âcel hommeâ 305,
âcelle Almeâ 667, âcelle amorouse peigneâ
Bal.
iii. 1. This use
of demonstrative for definite article is quite common.

305.
pot
, perhaps meant for subjunctive.

307. Cp.

v. 3: âSi fuisse en paradis ceo beal Manoir.â

322.

397.
grantment
: cp. l. 276.

407.
Qâun messager
&c. âSo that he sent a messenger at once
after him in great haste.â This is better than taking âtramistâ as
subjunctive (âthat he should sendâ &c.), because of âCil messagerâ in
the next stanza. For âqueâ meaning âso thatâ cp. 431, 485.

415.
Depar le deable et.
This position of the conjunction is
characteristic of Gowerâs English writing, e.g.
Conf. Am. Prol.

155, 521, 756, &c., and it often occurs also in the present work: cp.
100, 1008, 2955, &c. âDepar le deableâ evidently is better taken here
with âpriaâ than with the preceding line. The words thus treated are
âet,â âmais,â âcar,â âainzâ (24646).

416.
hastera
: see note on 1184.

440.
Je tâen vois loer promettant
, âI promise you payment for

noticed at l. 230, &c.

442.
ne tâen soietz

Du Char folie
, âby reason of the wantonness of the Fleshâ:
âduâ belongs to âfolie.â

761.
de ton honour
, âby means of the honour which you have to
bestow.â

780. âSo that you may have Man back againâ: for this use of âdoisâ see
note on 1193.

799.
câil
, for âsâilâ: so âceâ for âseâ 1147, âCiriensâ for
âSiriensâ 10314.

, âwhomâ: this form is quite freely used as an object of
the verb; see Glossary.

865.

: cp. l. 139, &c.

912.
le
: this is used (side by side with âluy,â e.g. 921) as
indirect object masculine or feminine, though âlaâ is also found.

940. We must take âdeesceâ as a dissyllable. The usual form is âduesseâ
(âdieuesceâ
Bal.
xx. 4).

943.
ce buisson
, i.e. âle buisson.â

948. This line occurs again 9453, and is practically reproduced

Bal.
xiii. 1:

âQuelle est sanz point, sanz reule et sanz mesure.â

It means here that the feasting was without limit. For the form of
expression cp. 984.

987.
As grans hanaps
&c., i.e. âa emplir les grans hanaps.â This
kind of combination is not uncommon, e.g. 5492, âdes perils ymaginer.â

988.
par envoisure
, âin gaietyâ: âenvoisureâ means properly
âtrick,â âdevice,â connected with such words as âvoisdie,â hence
âpleasantry,â âgaiety.â

992.
les firont rejoÃ¯r
, âdelighted themâ: see note on 1135.

997.
sâestuit.
In 613 and 15144 this means âwas silent,â from
âsâesteire,â and that sense will perhaps do for it here. However, the
form ârestuitâ below suggests âesteir,â which presumably might be used
reflexively, and âsâestuitâ would then mean âstood.â This may be the
sense also in 626.

1008. Cp. 415.

1015.
luy
, used for âly,â the def. article: see Glossary under
âly.â

1016. âMuch resembled one anotherâ: cp. such compounds as
âsâentrecontrer,â âsâentrasseurer,â &c.

1027.
le livre.
What âbookâ is our author following in his
statement that the Deadly Sins are âhermafodrite,â as he calls it? Or
does this reference only apply to what follows about the meaning of the
word?

1030. âIf I lay upon them female names,â but âenditerâ is employed in
an unusual sense.

1061.
au seinte ... quideroit
, âshould believe her to be a
saint.â

1066.
Tant plus come
, âThe more that,â answered by âTant plusâ
in the next line.

1069. Apparently the meaning is that Hypocrisy in public separates
herself from others and stands apart: for âsingulereâ cp. 1513.

1081. 2 Kings xx. 12 ff.

1085. âAccording to the divination of the prophet,â taking âdevinantâ
as a substantive, like âvivant,â âpensant,â &c.

[Pg 398]

1094. For this use of the verb cp.
Trait.

1100 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 604 f.,

âAnd he that was a lomb beforn

Is thanne a wolf.â

1117. Matt. xxiii. 27.

1127. Probably Is. ix. 17.

1135.
qâom fait despire
, âwhich one abhors,â the auxiliary use
of âfaire,â which is very common in our author, like âdo,â âdoth,â in
English: cp. 39, 168, 368, 488, 992, 1320,
Bal.
iv. 1, &c. In
some places this auxiliary (again like the English âdoâ) takes the
place of the principal verb, which is understood from a preceding
clause, e.g. 3180, 10649. These uses are common in Old French
generally, but perhaps more so in Anglo-Norman than in the Continental
dialects.

1146. Bern.

1147.
ce
for âseâ: see note on 799.

âvoitâ 1185, âfaitâ 1401.

1184.
quâil serra poy mangant
, âthat he shall eat little,â the
future being used in command as in 416, 688. For the participle with
auxiliary see note on l. 118.

1193.
lâen doit loer
: âshould praise himâ: an auxiliary use of
âdoit,â which stands for âmayâ in all senses: cp. 780, 3294, 6672,
17041, &c.

1194. Similar sayings of Augustine are quoted elsewhere by our author,
e.g. 10411, 20547.

1244.
qui lors prise
, &c., âwhen one praises her, she thinks not
that God can undo her by any means.â This is probably the meaning: cp.
such expressions as âqui bien guarde en son purpensâ 9055, âqui bien se
cureâ 16541, &c. Compare the use of âwho thatâ in Gowerâs English, e.g.

Conf. Am. Prol.
460.

1261.
laisse nient que
, &c., âfails not to keep with him,â &c.

1273. Job xxi. 12, 13: âTenent tympanum et citharam, et gaudent ad
sonitum organi. Ducunt in bonis dies suos, et in puncto ad inferna
descendunt.â

1280. Perhaps Is. v. 14.

1285. The passage is Jeremiah xlv. 5. âYsaÃ¯eâ is a mistake for
âJeremie,â which would suit the metre equally well and perhaps was
intended by the author.

1291. There is nothing exactly corresponding to this in the book of
Joel, but perhaps it is a general reference to the first chapter.

1317. Ecclus. xxv. 3. This book is sometimes referred to as âSalomon,â
and sometimes more properly as âSidracâ: cp. 2509.

1326. Ps. li. 3, âQuid gloriaris in malitia, qui potens es in
iniquitate?â

1335. Job xx. 6, 7.

1365.
frise
: a puzzling word. It ought to mean here âblows,â or
âblows cold,â of the wind.

[Pg 399]

1375. âIt is she who causes a man to be raised from a foot-page to
great lordship.â

1389. âHe plays them so false a turnâ: âtresgeterâ came to be used
especially of cheating or juggling, hence âtregetour.â

1400. Cp. 14473.

1401.
fait
: indic. for subj. in rhyme.

1416. Cp. 12780, âNâad pas la langue au fil pendant.â

1446. Perhaps âpareillâ is here a substantive and means âequality.â

1447.
qui
, âwhom.â

1460.
est plus amant
, i.e. âaime.â

1495 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 2409-2415, where the same idea of a
wind of pride blowing away a manâs virtue is suggested under the head
of âAvantance.â

1518. âNoli me tangereâ is perhaps originally from John xx. 17, but it
has received a very different application.

1563. The story was that the hunter, having carried off the tigerâs
cubs and being pursued, would throw behind him in the path of the
animal a sphere of glass, the reflection in which was supposed by the
tiger to be one of her lost cubs. This would delay her for a time, and
by repeating the process the man would be able to ride away in safety
with his booty: see Ambrose,
Hex.
vi. 4. The story is founded on
that told by Pliny,
Nat. Hist.
viii. 25.

1575. Perhaps an inaccurate reminiscence of John viii. 49.

1585. The reference is to Job xi. 12, âVir vanus in superbiam erigitur,
et tanquam pullum onagri se liberum natum putat.â The rest is due to
our author.

1597. Ecclus. xxxvii. 3. âO praesumptio nequissima, unde creata es...?â
The rest is added by our author.

1624. Matt. vii. 1, 2.

1627. Probably Is. xxix. 14, but it is not an exact quotation.

1645. Job xxx. 1, âNunc autem derident me iuniores tempore.â

1648. Job xii. 4, âderidetur enim iusti simplicitas.â

1653. The reference is no doubt intended for the Elegies of Maximianus,
but I think no such passage occurs in them. Perhaps our author was
thinking of Cato,
Distich.
iii. 7,

Alterius dictum aut factum nec carpseris unquam,

Exemplo simili ne te derideat alter.

1662.
faisoit
, singular for the rhyme, with the excuse of
âchascunâ to follow.

1669. Perhaps Prov. xxiv. 9, âabominatio hominum detractor,â or xvi. 5,
âAbominatio Domini est omnis arrogans.â

1678. Ps. lix. (
Vulg.
lviii.) 8 (9), âEt tu, Domine, deridebis
eos.â

1684 ff. It is suggested here that Malapert gets his name from

[Pg 400]
discovering things which should be concealed, saying them âen apertâ;
but the word is rather from âapertâ in the sense of âboldâ âimpudent,â
whence the modern English âpert.â

1688.
serroit
, âought to be,â a common use of the conditional:
cp. 6915, 8941, &c., and
Vox Clam.
iii. 1052 and elsewhere,
where the Latin imp. subj. is used in the same way.

1709 f. âAll set themselves to listen what he will say.â

1711.
si nuls soit
, âif there be any.â

1717. Prov. ix. 7, âQui erudit derisorem, ipse iniuriam sibi facit.â

1740.
nâen dirroit plus avant
, âwould not go further in speaking
of it,â âavantâ being probably an adverb: cp. 1762.

1758. Boeth.
de Cons.
iii. Pr. 8. âIgitur te pulcrum videri non
tua natura sed oculorum spectantium reddit infirmitas.â

1762 f.
si par tout avant

see the rest.â

conditional sense.

1795.

1824. âOften you see evil come (upon him).â The reference may be to
Prov. xvi. 18, or to some similar saying.

1825. Zephaniah iii. 11.

1828. Perhaps Jer. xlviii. 29 ff.

1837. Luke xviii. 9 ff.

1848.
par soy despisant
: a characteristic use of the gerund for
infinitive: cp. 6093.

1849. The references to Solinus in this book are mostly false. Many
of the anecdotes may be found in Pliny, but not this. Isidore gives
the etymology, but the original of the story here is perhaps Albertus
Magnus
de Animalibus
(quoted by the Delphin editor on Plin.

N. H.
x. 3).

1868. Perhaps Ps. ci. 5. In any case the last lines of the stanza are
an addition by our author to the quotation.

1883.
fait a reprendre
, âdeserves to be blamedâ: cp. 5055, 9687,
12238, &c., and see the examples quoted by Burguy,
Grammaire
,
ii. 167 f.

1887. The story is told at length in
Conf. Am.
i. 2785 ff.

1912 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 2416 ff., but the parallel is not very
close.

1942.
parferroit.
The contraction is thus written out in all
parts of this verb, because âparfaire,â âparfait,â occur in full, e.g.
4413. Probably, however, there was fluctuation between âparâ and âper,â
as in âparfit,â âparigal.â

1944. It would perhaps be difficult to say why Montpelliers should be
a proverbially rich place, but Mr. Archer points out to me that such
expressions as this are common in the
chansons de geste
, e.g.

Chanson dâAntioche
ii. 628, âIl nây vousist mie estre pour lâor
de Montpellier.â Pavia is referred to in
Mir.
7319 in the same
way.

âhe will curse continually.â

2067.
lâen chastie

2142. France is looked upon simply as a land which has revolted from
its lawful sovereign, Edward III, who has the right âfrom his mother,â
2148. This passage was apparently written before the death of Edward
III.

2169. âIs delivered up in slavery to him.â

2353 ff. Acts ix. 5. In this stanza the word âpointâ occurs no less
than six times in the rhyme. This is an extreme instance of a common
case, any difference in the meaning or manner of employment being
[Pg 402]
held
both in French and English verse to justify the repetition of the same
word as a rhyme. Here âpointâ is the past participle of a verb in 2357
and is used as an adverb in 2356: in the other four cases it is simply
the same substantive with differences of meaning.

to this book, âThe wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach,â but he also
quotes from it under the name of Solomon, cp. 1317, and curiously
enough the very next quotation, taken from the same chapter, is a case
of this kind.

is to his Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, i. 10, âDetractio
est aliorum bene gesta opera vel in malum malitiose mutare, vel
invidendo fallaci fraude diminuere,â &c. (Migne.
Patrol.
cxvii.
377).

2653. Numbers xii. 1.

2665. Probably the reference is to Is. xiv. 13-15, but the beginning is
loosely quoted: the latter part is closer, see verse 15, âad infernum
detraheris in profundum laci.â

2677 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 388 ff., where âMaleboucheâ comes in
as the attendant of âDetraccioun.â

2700.
le meinz
, âthe less,â cp. âly pireâ 2760, âle plusâ 12347,
âle meulxâ 14396.

2715. I do not understand this. By comparison with
Conf. Am.
ii.
394 ff. the passage should mean that he praises first, and then ends up
with blame, which overcasts all the praise: cp. Chaucer,
Persones
Tale
, 494 (Skeat). Perhaps we ought to read âprimerementâ for
âdarreinement.â

[Pg 403]

2742. For the metre cp. 24625 and see Introduction, p. xlv.

2749. See du Cange under âfagolidoriâ (Gr. ÏÎ±Î³Î¿Î»Î¿Î¯Î´Î¿ÏÎ¿Î¹), where the
passage of Jerome is quoted, but the word is set down as probably a
corruption of ÏÎ¹Î»Î¿Î»Î¿Î¯Î´Î¿ÏÎ¿Î¹.

2761. Ps. x. 7 (
Vulg.
ix. 28).

2779. Ps. cxl. 3 (
Vulg.
cxxxix. 4).

2790. Ps. xxxviii. 20 (
Vulg.
xxxvii. 21), âQui retribuunt mala
pro bonis, detrahebant mihi, quoniam sequebar bonitatem.â

2799. Jer. xviii. 21 f.

2809. Ps. xxxi. 18 (
Vulg.
xxx. 19), cp. cxix. (
Vulg.

lxviii), 23.

2861. Jer. li. 1, but the passage is misunderstood.

2865. Rom. i. 30, âDetractores, Deo odibiles.â

2874. Bern.
Int. Dom.
xxiii. 49, âDetrahentes et audientes pari
reatu detinentur.â

2893. The disgusting habits of the hoopoe in nesting are often referred
to.

2894 ff. There is a close parallel to this in
Conf. Am.
ii. 413
ff.,

âLich to the Scharnebudes kinde,

Of whos nature this I finde,â &c.

2908. Perhaps Prov. xxii. 1.

2917 ff. Luke xvii. 1, 2.

2923. Matt. xviii. 8, 9.

2931. Ps. l. (
Vulg.
xlix.) 20, but it is a very much expanded
quotation.

2941. Deut. xxii. 13-19.

2955. See note on 415.

2959. Perhaps a general reference to Ezek. xviii.

2961.
ne tient plait de
, &c., âdoes not hold discourse of
example of holy scripture.â

3109. Acts iv. 1.

3116. This line is too long, no doubt by inadvertence, having five
measures instead of four. So in
Bal.
xxvii. the first line is of
six measures instead of five. Both might easily be amended, if it were
thought desirable: for example, here we might read

âQâavoit leur prechement oÃ¯e.â

The word âprechementâ occurs 18092, and very probably this
is what the author meant to write.

3133. Ps. vii. 16 (17).

3137. The reference is perhaps to Ecclus. xxvii. 25-29.

3145. The reference is Jeremiah xlv. 3.

3158. Cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 222, âA vice revers unto this,â where
the author is speaking of the same thing as here.

3160. The MS. has âmale,â but perhaps the author meant to write âmal,â
for disregard of gender is common with him, while formal irregularity
of metre is exceedingly rare. Compare, however, 10623, 10628. For the
form of expression cp. 3467.

[Pg 404]

3180.
fait
, used here to supply the place of âescoulte.â âAs the
fox listens for the hounds, so doth he for other menâs loss.â See note
on 1135.

3233.
Par si qâ
, âprovided that,â cp. 20576.

3234 ff. This is the tale told in illustration of the vice of âGaudium
alterius doloris,â in
Conf. Am.
ii. 291-364.

3240. âWhen the game was thus set between them.â From this kind of
expression comes âjeu parti,â âjeupartie,â meaning a set game or match
between two parties, hence a risk or hazardous alternative: Engl.
âjeopardy.â

3248. Ps. xxxviii. 16 (or xiii. 4).

3253. Ezek. xxv. 3 ff.

3265 ff. John xvi. 20.

3271 ff. This is an addition by our author, who is always unwilling to
overlook the punishment of the wicked.

3277. Ecclus. xix. 5, âQui gaudet iniquitate, denotabitur.â

3285. Matt. viii. 12, &c.

3294.
doit supplanter
, âmay supplantâ: see note on 1193.

3361. Cic.
de Off.
iii. 21.

3365.
Conjecture
, âtrickeryâ: cp. 6389.

3367.
ce que chalt
: cp. 8905, 25269, 25712. Here and at 8905 it
stands by itself, but in the other cases it is followed by âcar,â or
âquant.â It is apparently equivalent to âit matters not,â or some such
phrase.

3388. Ps. xli. 9 (
Vulg.
xl. 10): âmagnificavit super me
supplantationemâ is the Latin version.

3398.
Ambicioun
: evidently not âambitionâ in the ordinary sense,
but the vice of those who go about prying into other peopleâs affairs,
and playing the spy upon them with a view to some advantage for
themselves.

3415. Perhaps Habakkuk ii. 8, 9: cp. 3601, where Habakkuk is certainly
quoted as âBaruch.â

3445. Jer. iii. 24.

3453.
cele
, used for definite article, see note on 301.

3457. Prov. xi. 3 ff.

3467. A favourite form of expression with our author, cp. 3160, and

Trait.
ii. 1 ff.,

âSi lâun est bon, lâautre est assetz meilour.â

3487.
Qui
, âHe whom.â

3531. Prov. xxvi. 22.

3533.
affole
, âwoundsâ (Low Latin âfullareâ), to be
distinguished from âaffolerâ meaning âto make foolish.â

3541. Ps. lv. 21 (
Vulg.
liv. 22), âMolliti sunt sermones eius
super oleum, et ipsi sunt iacula.â

3553. Ecclus. xl. 21, âTibiae et psalterium suavem faciunt melodiam, et
super utraque lingua suavis.â

3559. Prov. xxix. 5.

[Pg 405]

3575. âHis deeds change into sorrow that by which before he made them
laughâ:
luy
for
ly
=
les
.

3584 ff. Cp. the Latin lines (beginning âNil bilinguis agetâ) which
introduce the description of âFals semblantâ in
Conf. Am.
ii.
1879, âVultus habet lucem, tenebras mensâ &c.

3589. Ecclus. xxxvii. 20 (23) f., âQui sophistice loquitur odibilis
est: in omni re defraudabitur. Non est illi data a Domino gratia,â &c.

3601. The quotation is from Habakkuk ii. 15 f.

3612 ff. Ps. cxx. 3, 4, of which these two stanzas are a much expanded
version.

3637. Ecclus. xxviii. 15 ff.

3667. Perhaps Job v. 12.

3679. Micah ii. 1, âVae, qui cogitatis inutile.â

3685. Jer. iv. 4, âne forte egrediatur ut ignis indignatio mea, et
succendatur, et non sit qui extinguat, propter malitiam cogitationum
vestrarum.â

3721. Cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 401,

âFor as the Netle which up renneth

The freisshe rede Roses brenneth,

And makth hem fade and pale of hewe,

Riht so this fals Envious heweâ &c.

The opposition of rose and nettle is common in our author,
e.g.
Bal.
xxxvi. 3, xlviii. 1,
Vox Clam.
vii. 181.

3725.
lâille Colcos
: cp.
Trait.
viii. 1, and
Conf.
Am.
v. 3265: so also in Chaucer. Guido delle Colonne is the person
mainly responsible for the idea.

3727.
Medea la meschine
, âMedea the maid.â The word âmeschineâ
means âmaidservantâ just above and in 5163, but it was also used
generally for âgirl,â âyoung woman,â as âmeschinâ for âyoung man.â The
origin is said to be an Arabic word meaning âpoorâ (cp. the meaning of
âmesquin,â âmeschino,â in modern French and Italian), hence âfeeble,â
âdelicate.â

3735. Rev. xii. 7, 10: âen oelâ stands apparently for âante conspectum
Dei.â

3747. The description of the basilisk is perhaps from Solinus,

Collect.
27. He had it from Plin.
Nat. Hist.
viii. 121.

3773. Prov. xiv. 30, âputredo ossium invidia.â

3781. Levit. xiii. 46.

3801. Hor.
Epist.
i. 2. 58, âInvidia Siculi non invenere tyranni
Maius tormentum.â Our author did not understand it quite rightly.

3805. Cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 20, and
Prol.
329. In all these
passages the reference is to the fire of Envy as a heat that consumes
itself, rather than anything outside itself.

3823. Cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 3122 ff.

3831.
Conf. Am.
ii. 3095 ff., where the saying is attributed to
Seneca: cp. Dante,
Inf.
xiii. 64.

3841. Perhaps Jerome, who says something of the kind: cp.
Wisd.

ii. 24.

[Pg 406]

3864.
les faisont a despire
, âhate themâ: but the preposition
with the infinitive in this kind of expression is unusual. As a rule
âfaisont a despireâ would mean âought to be hatedâ: cp. 1883.

3882.
pour poy du riens
, âfor a trifling matter,â lit. âfor
little of matterâ: cp. 4826.

3898.
Ore voet, noun voet
, i.e. âOre voet, ore noun voet,â but
cp. 5470.

3913. The text is Ecclus. iv. 30 (35): see note on 1317.

3925. Prov. xxv. 28.

3958. Perhaps we ought rather to read âpour ton salu.â

3977. Exod. xxxii. 21, and other passages.

3997. Baruch iv. 6.

4021. Perhaps suggested by Ps. lxxviii. (
Vulg.
lxxvii.) 58 ff.

4067.
Par contumelie
: for the metre see note on 296, and cp.
4312, 4317.

4077. Cp. 4704.

4112. âWhich flies free without caging.â

4117. Referred to also by Chaucer,
Wyf of Bath, Prol.
278 ff.,
and
Tale of Melibeus
, 2276. It is a common enough saying, but
not to be found in the Bible in this form: cp. Prov. xxvii. 15.

4129. Jer. viii. 17.

4141. Ecclus. xxv. 15 (22), âNon est caput nequius super caput colubri,
et non est ira super iram mulieris.â

4147. Perhaps Prov. xv. 2, âos fatuorum ebullit stultitiam.â

4155. Ecclus. xxi. 29, âIn ore fatuorum cor illorum.â

4168. This is related also
Conf. Am.
iii. 639 ff., and there too
a doubt is expressed as to whether so much patience was altogether wise.

4189 ff. Ecclus. xxviii. 18 (22) ff.

4203. Ecclus. xxviii. 24 (28), âSepi aures tuas spinis, linguam nequam
noli audire.â

4213. James iii. 7, 8.

4219. Apparently a vague reference to Amos iv. 6, 9, âdedi vobis
stuporem dentium ... Percussi vos in vento urente.â

4237. Zech. v. 5 ff.

4273.
Rampone
, âraillery,â âmockery,â cp. Ital. ârampognare.â

4285 ff. The idea seems to be this: âContention wounded by wrath
encamps in the heart in a tent of mockery, whence it issues forth
through the mouth, and assisted by Slander and Defamation enlarges
other menâs vices to their greatest extent, until its own wound becomes
so foul that he dies who inhales its corruption.â

4369. Prov. xxvii. 6.

4381. Ecclus. xii. 16.

4387. Prov. vi. 16, 18.

4393. Cic.
de Amic.
89, âodium, quod est venenum amicitiae.â

4453. Beemoth is here perhaps confused with Leviathan, which was
regarded by some as a kind of serpent: see Isidore,
Etym.
viii.
27.

[Pg 407]

4462.
le al
: there is of course an elision, though not indicated
in the text.

4477. 2 Macc. v. 17, &c.

4494. Note that in the forms ârefusablez,â âabhominablez,â
âdelitablez,â &c., the
z
is equivalent to
s
, and does not
imply any accenting of the final syllable.

4542.
ou
, for âau,â see Glossary.

4558.
devant lez meins
, âbeforehandâ: cp. 5436.

4561.
survient.
This and the other verbs rhyming with it in the
stanza seem to be in the past tense, for âsurvint,â âvint,â âtint,â &c.
Other examples of this will be found elsewhere, e.g. 8585, 9816. The
passage means: âWhen the fire from heaven fell on the sacrifice, it was
Malignity that inspired the hatred of Abel in the heart of Cain, for
which he was accursed.â âDontâ answers regularly to such expressions as
âpar tiele guiseâ: see note on 217.

4570. Ps. x. 15, âContere brachium peccatoris et maligni.â

4605. Ps. xxii. 16 (
Vulg.
xxi. 17), âconcilium malignantium
obsedit me,â &c.

4704.
mestre Catoun
: the author of the well-known

Disticha
, many of whose maxims tend to teach patience.

4717. Exod. xxi. 24 f.

4729. Exod. xxi. 26 f.

4741. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iii. 1095,

âContek, so as the bokes sein,

Folhast hath to his Chamberlein,â &c.

4750.
le court sure
, âruns upon himâ; so 10763 and elsewhere.

4752.
lâun ne lesse
, âhe fails not to attain one or the other,â
i.e. either the object of his violence, or his own destruction.

4753. Is. ii. 22, âQuiescite ergo ab homine, cuius spiritus in naribus
eius est.â This illustrates the meaning, otherwise rather obscure,
of the Latin line after
Conf. Am.
iii. 1088 (introducing the
subject of âContekâ), which is seen by this to be a reference to the
above passage of Isaiah.

4769.
come fist a Asahel
, âas it did to Asahelâ: see note on
1135. The reference is to 2 Sam. ii. 18 ff.

4826. Cp. 3882.

4837. Ecclus. xxii. 30, âAnte ignem camini vapor et fumus ignis
inaltatur: sic et ante sanguinem maledicta et contumeliae et minae.â

4850. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iii. 453 ff.

4858.
voit
, used for
vait
, as 3 sing. pres. ind.

4864 ff. This kind of repetition is often used by our author, cp. 8294
ff.,
Vox Clam.
iii. 11 ff., and
Conf. Am.
v. 2469 ff.

4870.
ou giroun
, âin the bosomâ: âgiro(u)nâ is properly the bend
or fold of a cloak (sinus).

4897. 2 Sam. iv.

4906. Matt. xxvi. 52, Rev. xiii. 10.

4945. Ex. xxi. 14.

[Pg 408]

4962. 2 Sam. vii. 4 ff., but it is not quite accurately cited.

4973. Gen. ix. 6.

5005. Ezek. xxv. 12 f.

5018. Is. xiv. 12, âCorruisti in terram, qui vulnerabas gentes.â The
rest is hardly a quotation, though it may give the general sense.

5029 ff. The same thing is related with the same application in

Conf. Am.
iii. 2599-2616. There, as here, it is referred to
Solinus, but this seems to be a mistaken reference.

5031.
a diviser
, âto describeâ (or âcompareâ), i.e. âto describe
it, we may say that it hasâ &c.: so, âpour deviserâ 11245, âau droit

5114 ff. Matt. v. 3, 5.

5126.
DâAccidie
: see note on 296.

5179. For the use of âlÃ©eâ in this phrase as a dissyllable cp. 15518,
âove lÃ©e chiere,â 17122, 28337. When occurring in other connexions it
seems to follow the usual rule, as in 28132, 28199, &c.

5190 f. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 2739 f.,

âAnd makth his exposicion

After the disposicion

Of that he wolde.â

The connexion is the same as here.

5205. On the subject of âTirelincelâ cp. Waddington,
Man. des
Pech.
4078 ff.

5216. âHold thy nurture so dearâ (as to think of it in this matter):
ânorretureâ is that which has to do with physical development, and
âpreuâ I take to represent the Latin âprope,â which appears in this
form among others: see Godefroy.

5252. Cp. 8130. To judge by LittrÃ©âs examples for the
fourteenth-century usage of âbout,â it would seem to be specially used
of the top or bottom of a cask.

5257. Prov. xxvi. 14.

5266. Cato,
Distich.
i. 2:

âPlus vigila semper, neu somno deditus esto,

Nam diuturna quies vitiis alimenta ministrat.â

5269. I do not know what passage is referred to.

5283. Jer. li. 39, âinebriabo eos, ut sopiantur et dormiant somnum
sempiternum et non consurgant.â

5329. Ecclus. xli. 1, âO mors, quam amara est memoria tua homini pacem
habenti in substantiis suis.â The rest is our authorâs addition.

5344. Deut. xxviii. 56 f.

5349.
Cil homme tendre
, equivalent to âlâomme tendre,â so 5553,
âcelle alme peccheresseâ: see note on 301.

[Pg 409]

5376.
Luy dorra
: usually in this form of expression (which
is common alike in the French, Latin, and English of our author) a
negative is used with the verb of the second clause, e.g.
Bal.

xviii. 2.

5377. âPeresceâ answers to âYdelnesseâ in the
Confessio Amantis
.

5389 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 1090 f.,

âIn Wynter doth he noght for cold,

In Somer mai he noght for hete.â

5395 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 1108 ff.,

âAnd as a cat wolde ete fisshes

Withoute wetinge of his cles,

So wolde he do.â

5436.
apres la mein
: cp. 4558 and
Conf. Am.
iv. 893:
âThanne is he wys after the hond,â an exact translation of this line.

5437 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 877 ff.

5449. Prov. xx. 4.

5452.
beguinage
, equivalent to âbeggerieâ (5800), as âbeguyneâ
(6898) is used for âbeggar.â The Beguins were mendicants.

5455. 2 Thess. iii. 10.

5458.
le decrÃ©
: the reference is probably to the Canon law; cp.
7480.

5492.
des perils ymaginer.
This form of expression, in which the
preposition belonging to the infinitive is combined with the article of
the object, occurs also 9339, 16303, and elsewhere. So also in other
authors, as
Rom. de la Rose
2875, âOr sunt as roses garder troi.â

5499. Prov. vii. 10-22.

5500.
Qui
, âwhom.â

5572 f. âHe who has growth in common with the treesâ; an allusion to
the text of Gregory quoted so often by our author: see 26869.

5580.
apparant
: I take this to mean âheir apparent,â as in

Conf. Am.
ii. 1711.

5606. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 9,

âAnd everemore he seith, âTomorwe.ââ

5622. The kissing of the âpaxâ came after the prayer of consecration.

5645 ff. Matt. x. 22, and Luke ix. 62.

5659. Deut. xxv. 18.

5701 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 3389 ff., where, however, âTristesceâ
is described as developed from âSlowtheâ generally, not (as here)
from âLachesceâ in particular. âTristesceâ is there synonymous with
âDesesperance.â

5714. Prov. xxv. 20, âSicut tinea vestimento et vermis ligno, ita
tristitia viri nocet cordi.â The English version is quite different.

5729 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
iv. 3432 ff.,

âFor Tristesce is of such a kinde,

That forto meintiene his folie

He hath with him Obstinacie,

[Pg 410]

Which is withinne of such a slouthe

That he forsaketh alle trouthe,

And wole unto no reson bowe.â

5758. Job vii. 16, âDesperavi: nequaquam ultra iam vivam.â

5762. Jer. xviii. 12 ff., âQui dixerunt: Desperavimus: post
cogitationes enim nostras ibimus ... Ideo haec dicit Dominus:
Interrogate gentes: quis audivit talia horribilia?... Quia oblitus
est mei populus meus,... ut fieret terra eorum in desolationem et in
sibilum sempiternum: omnis qui praeterierit per eam obstupescet et
movebit caput suum.â This is a good example of our authorâs method of
dealing with a text.

5792. Cp. 8492.

jure vent et voie
: cp. 8685, âjure tout le monde.â

5822. Cp.

5839. Eccles. ii. 21, âNam cum alius laboret in sapientia et doctrina
et sollicitudine, homini otioso quaesita dimittit: et hoc ergo vanitas
et magnum malum.â I suspect we should read here

âque câest errour

Et vanitÃ©,â &c.

5845. Perhaps Ecclus. xxxiii. 29, âMultam enim malitiam docuit
otiositas,â the rest being added by our author.

5854. The reference is perhaps really to Ezek. xvi. 49.

5868. Matt. xii. 44 f.

5879. After this, one leaf has been cut out, which contained 190
lines and one rubric, âLa quinte file de Accidie, qâest appellÃ©e
Necgligence,â or something to that effect.

6070. The author seems here to be speaking of the negligence shown by
overseers of some kind, who do not efficiently superintend those under
their authority.

[Pg 411]

6313 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
v. 2859 ff., where Coveitise has two
especial counsellors, Falswitness and Perjurie.

6315. âChalengeâ (Lat. calumnia) is a claim or accusation against a
person in a court of law, usually in a bad sense.

6328.
falt ... pour retenir
, âit is necessary to retainâ: âpourâ
is often used by our author instead of âdeâ or âa,â representing
perhaps the English âfortoâ: cp. ll. 7650, 10639, 29078,
Bal.

immediately after âRavineâ (v. 6075 ff.), though not as
dependent upon it.

7025 f. Cp.
Conf. Am.

here.

7033 ff. Cp.

7081. Gen. xxxi. 19 ff.

7093. This story is told
Conf. Am.
v. 7105*-7207* under the head
of Sacrilege, with no essential difference except in the greater detail
and in the name of the person involved. Here it is âDyonis,â apparently
for convenience of rhyming, there Lucius.

[Pg 413]

v. 7186* ff.,

âGold in his kinde, as seith the bok,

this stanza, are more fully developed
Conf. Am.

8459.

7511.
privÃ© de son secroy
, âprivy to his secret counsels.â

7549. The reference is not really to the Psalter, but to the song of
Moses, Deut. xxxii. 13.

7562. Ecclus. xxxi. 29, âNequissimo in pane murmurabit civitas.â

7569. 2 Cor. ix. 6.

7587. âthe right pit of helle,â as they said in English. The same
comparison is made

v. 29 ff. With these cp. Chaucer,

Tale of Melibeus
: âAnd therefore seith seint Austyn that the
averous man is likned unto helleâ &c.

7640. The author referred to as âMarcialâ here and in ll. 15505,
15949, is in fact Godfrey of Winchester, popularly called by the name
of the epigrammatist whom he not unhappily imitated. He was a native
of Cambrai, and prior of St. Swithinâs in the twelfth century. His
epigrams are repeatedly quoted under the name of Martial by Albertano
of Brescia in the
Liber Consolationis
. They will be found in
Wrightâs
Satirical Poets of the
Twelfth Century
(Rolls series).
The reference here is to
Ep.
cxxxvi,

âNon sibi, non aliis prodest, dum vivit, avarus:

Et prodest aliis et sibi, dum moritur.â

7645 ff. Cp.
Conf. Am.
v. 49 ff., a very close parallel,

: a form of âfrarinâ (âfrerinâ), âbeggarly,â hence
âwretched.â

7731. For this use of âtireâ cp.

7739. See note on 415.

7777. Job xv. 27, âOperuit faciem eius crassitudo, et de lateribus eius

he was also thinking of xl. 15 (11).

7896. âNor will they hunt in that wood,â that is, they will not share
in the sport: âbrosser,â âbruisser,â a term of the chase, meaning to
ride or run through thick underwood, see LittrÃ© under âbrosser,â and

New Eng. Dict.
âbrush.â

winter was hard to get.

7969. Cp.

8459. I substitute
devont

: cp. 7507.

8482.
superflual
: the adjective form is used instead of the name
âSuperfluitÃ©â for the sake of the rhyme.

8495. Some correction seems to be required. Perhaps read âSiqeâ for
âSiqâil.â

8501. Cp.

altas,â a text not unknown in English history.

8916. Matt. vii. 26.

[Pg 416]

8924. âWhereby she will deliver up her body free,â i.e. since she
gives presents as well as receiving them, she must be held not to sell
herself, but to give herself away to her lover; and this, observes the
author, is the worse alternative, because it impoverishes her husband.

, âas his subject and servant.â

9055. âIf we consider well, we shall see thatâ &c.: see note on 1244.

9068. The reference is to Job xxxi. 9-12. The verse quoted is âIgnis
est usque ad perditionem devorans, et omnia eradicans genimina.â

9085. âIncestâ is here used in a much wider sense than belongs to the
word in English. It includes the impure intercourse of those who are
near of kin, as we see in ll. 9181 ff.; but the cases of it which are
chiefly insisted on have to do with breach of the ecclesiastical vow
of purity, and this not only where the confessor corrupts his penitent
(who is his daughter in a spiritual sense), but also in general where
monk, nun, or priest commits fornication.

9130 ff. âso that at last by reason of his inconstancy and habitual sin
we see Incest throw off his vows and leave the order.â

9132. The âpossessionersâ are the members of those religious orders
which held property, as distinguished from the mendicant orders
mentioned next.

9138.
ses Abbes.
If this is singular, the use of the subject
form after a preposition is very harsh: it is âson Abbesâ (though
subject) in l. 12115. Perhaps the monastic rent-collector is spoken of
here generally, and as coming from a variety of monasteries.

9139.
vois
, the usual form for âvais,â as 440, &c.

9143.
irroit
, see 1688.

9148.
ly limitantz
, âthe limitourâ: cp. Chaucerâs ironical
reference to him at the beginning of the
Wyf of Bathâs Tale
.

9156. The womanâs husband passes for the father of the children.

9158.
au dieu demeine
, âin the possession of God.â

9168. âThan he who does (the same) as regards his neighbourâ (who is
not under a religious vow).

9171. This is the case of the widowâs marriage to the Church, the vow
of not marrying again, see 17827 ff. This was taken, for example,
by Eleanor, sister of Henry III, who afterwards married Simon de
Montfort. The vow of course would be dispensed with, and the relations
here contemplated are probably those of marriage, notwithstanding the
severity with which they are spoken of in ll. 9172-74: therefore the
author is doubtful about the punishment of this offence in a future
state, and suggests that the arrangements of human law, by which
the wife would often suffer in property by such a marriage, may be
a sufficient punishment. On this subject see Furnivallâs
Fifty
Earliest English Wills
, E.E.T.S.

[Pg 417]

9229.
en cest escrit
, âin the scripture,â cp. 9277: so âcelleâ
is used for the definite article, 9786 and elsewhere; see note on 301.

9230. The reference seems to be a general one to such passages as Jer.
iii. 1 ff.

9240.
en ton despit
, âin hatred of thee.â

9265.
El viele loy
, e.g. Deut. xxiii. 17.

9281. Perhaps âburetteâ is here the same as âbirette,â used for a
ladyâs head-covering, see LittrÃ©: usually it means a small phial, and
âburettesâ might stand here for scent-bottles.

9292. For âmieâ without negative particle cp. 2589, and
Bal.

xliv. 1.

9311.
au petit loisir
seems to mean âin a small space of time,â
âloisirâ (âleisourâ) being ordinarily used in its modern sense,
referring to restrictions of time: so in the phrase âpar loisirâ
5693, and âa bon leisourâ 9222. In the next stanza, however, it
has a somewhat different sense, âfemme a son loisir faldra,â 9315,
meaning apparently âthe woman shall not be at his (
or
her) own
disposalâ; and later (9322) âau bon loisirâ means âwith ease.â

9314.
sur luy
, that is âon herâ: cp. 2151, 9351.

9320.
luy
, here equivalent to âlaâ: cp.
Bal.
xxiii. 2.

9359. The reference probably is to Matt. v. 28, âWhosoever looketh on a
woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
heart.â

9410.
sâordinaire
: cp. 1477.

9496. âCompels hearts to loveâ: so âpar destresceâ 5549, âby force.â

9553. 1 Cor. ii. 14, âAnimalis autem homo non percipit ea quae
sunt Spiritus Dei.â Our author not unnaturally fails to understand
âanimalis.â

9557. Wisd. 1. 4, âin malevolam animam non introibit sapientia.â

: used here for the rhyme, but it is in fact the older Norman
form, as in

This is the reading of the MS., but possibly the
author wrote âcliniantâ (for âcligniantâ).

9601. I do not know the reference.

9611. âunto the enemyâs throat.â

9613. The sense of this line is repeated by the word âLuxure,â 9616.

9616. Cic.

9620. âOthers will excuse themselves ill, but the old worse than the
rest,âor rather, none will be able to excuse themselves at allâ: this
seems to be the meaning.

9656.
serroit
: note on 1688.

: the subject form of the possessive pronoun is
used here, as âtesâ in

9786. The slight alteration of âmettroitâ to âmetteroitâ is required by
the metre.

9816.

9907. âSeven heads, because he devotes himself to the seven sins.â

equivalent to âse jue,â cp. 39, 1135, 1320, &c.

10071.
De resoun
, &c., explaining âle faisoit.â

for âjournÃ©es,â see Introduction, p. xx.

10121.

the rhyme. For the meaning cp.

10125.
les cornont
, âplay music to themâ: for âlesâ cp. 2416,
&c.; âpar leur journeiesâ seems to mean âon their way.â

10140. That is, the meeting will not be one of like with like.

as an adjective or substantive.

10311. 2 Chron. xx.

10324. There is nothing, so far as I know, corresponding with this
reference. It is possible that the author may have mistaken the
application of Jer. xxix. 7, where the Jews who are in captivity are
bidden to pray for the peace of the city where they now dwell, namely

[Pg 419]
Babylon. This occurs in close proximity with anticipations of an
eventual return.

10498. I do not think that what follows will be found in Jerome. The
classification of the seven deadly sins is of later date.

10505. âLest Sloth should seize himâ: the subjunctive was to be
expected, but syntax gives way to rhyme.

10526 ff. Cp. Chaucer,
Pers. Tale
133 ff. (Skeat), where there
are six causes which ought to move a man to contrition; but they are
not quite the same as those which we have here.

verse, with a superfluous syllable: see Introduction, p. xlv.

10637.
par semblance
, âas it were,â implying that âmorirâ is
metaphorical.

10639.

10651. Cp.
Conf. Am.
v. 2238 ff., where, however, the connexion
is different.

10669.
ot
, âthere wereâ: so âadâ is not uncommonly thus used for
âil y a,â e.g. 2174.

10707 ff.
la chalandre
. This bird, which seems to be a kind
of lark, is mentioned also in
Bal.
xii. 1. Bozon,
Contes
MoralizÃ©s
, p. 63, calls it âcalabre,â and says that if a man is
ill, and they wish to know whether he will live or die, they may bring
in this bird, and if it turns away from him, he will die. See M. Paul
Meyerâs note on the passage.

10717. The story is probably taken from Solinus, who combines the story
of the Arimaspians, as told by Herodotus and Pliny, with the account of
the emeralds produced in the country:
Collect.
15.

10718. âthe land which is called Scythia.â

10747.
Pour nostre essample.
The idea that these things were

done
, not only related, for our example is merely an extension
of the usual medieval view of Natural History.

10748.
nous attrait
, âteaches us,â (âbrings before usâ). For the
various meanings of âattraireâ compare the following passages, 567,
1550, 14480, 16637, 17800, 21623, 23361.

St. Remigius does not, so far as I know, mention the story of the
griffons and Arimaspians, but probably the following passage, where
the truth is compared to a treasure, may be the one referred to:
âHabemus namque magnum depositum fidei et doctrinae veritatis ...
velut pretiosum multiplicem thesaurum divinitus nobis ad custodiendum
commendatum: quem sine intermissione domino auxiliante delemus
inspicere, extergere, polire atque excutere ac diligentissime servare,
ne per incuriam et ignaviam nostram aut pulvere sordescat aut ...
malignorum spirituum insidiis vel a nocturnis et occultis furibus
effodiatur et deripiatur.â (
De tenenda Script. Verit.
i. 1.)

10800. âAnd in it he rejoicesâ: âfait demenerâ is equivalent to
âdemeine,â and âdemener ses joyesâ means âto rejoice,â cp. 444, 5038,
&c.

10801. Probably referring to Albertus Magnus
de Animalibus
, but
I do not know the passage.

10813. This comparison does not appear to be in Isidore, though he
gives much the same account as we have here of the origin of pearls.
(Isid.
Etym.
xii. 6. 49). Isidore no doubt borrowed the story
from Solinus (ch. 53), who had it indirectly from Pliny,
N. H.

ix. 54. In Bozon,
Contes MoralizÃ©s
, p. 41, we have the story
with nearly the same application as here.

10882. âHe who considers thisâ &c.

10903. âThat which pleases the oneâ &c., the verb being used here with
a direct object.

Conf. Am.
vi. 1513,
where the original Latin is quoted in the margin and attributed (as
here) to âOracius.â

10959. Perhaps a reminiscence of the line in
Pamphilus
, âEx
minima magnus scintilla nascitur ignis.â

10962. The quotation is really from Ovid,
Rem. Am.
421, âParva
necat morsu spatiosum vipera taurum.â It has perhaps been confused with
Sen.
Dial.

[Pg 422]

11354.
Tout quatre
: for this use of âtoutâ with numerals cp.
11570, âAd tout quatre oils.â It seems to be an adverb, as in the
expression âove toutâ ll. 4, 12240, &c., and has no particular meaning
apparently.

11396.
au fin que
, âuntil.â

11404. This âMestre Helemaunsâ is HÃ©linand, the monk of Froidmont,
whose
Vers de la Mort
were so popular in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. The lines which are quoted here are quoted
also in the
Somme des Vices et des Vertus
, with a slight
difference of text. See M. Paul Meyer in
Romania
i. 365, where
a preliminary list of the MSS. is given. Death is supposed to be the
speaker here, âDo away your mockery and your boasting, for many a man
who thinketh himself sound and strong hath me already hatching within
him.â The usual reading is âLaissiez vos chifflesâ (or âchiffloisâ),
but âOstezâ and âtrufesâ are also found in the MSS.

11410. âDeath has warned thee of his tricks,â because in the preceding
lines Death is supposed to be the speaker.

11434.

, âexcept for one thing.â

11770. It is likely enough that Cassiodorus says something of this kind
in his official letters, but it is hardly worth while to search for
it. Expressions such as, âMulto melius proficitur, si bonis moribus
serviatur,â are common enough.

12350. The reference belongs apparently to the next line, âHim whom
wind and sea obey,â and presumably it is to Mark iv. 41; but, if so,
there seems no reason for referring to St. Mark rather than to the
Gospels generally.

12356. Ps. cxviii. 9.

appara
is future, cp. 1140; used here in the sense of
command, âit shall not appear,â âobeieâ above, and ârequiereâ below,
being subjunctive in imperative sense, âlet a man obey,â &c.

12448. Bed.
in Luc.
xi., âClavis scientiae humilitas Christi
est.â

12452. This is a reference to the series of maxims attributed to
Ptolemy and prefixed in many MSS. and early printed editions to the
Almagest. See the paper in
Anglia
xviii. pp. 133-140, by E.
FlÃ¼gel, who prints the whole set of sayings and shews that the Almagest
references in the
Roman de la Rose
and in Chaucer are to these.
We have here a reference to the ninth in order, âQui inter sapientes
humilior est, sapientior existit, sicut locus profundior magis abundat
aquis aliis lacunis.â

Legenda Aurea
. St.
Macarius
[Pg 425]
was a recluse of Upper Egypt, who is described as âingeniosus

we find also in l. 12934, where âluyâ stands for direct object, as

14443. 1 Kings xix.

14449. The reference is to a dramatic love-poem in Latin elegiac verse
with the title
Pamphilus
, or
Pamphilus de Amore
, which
was
[Pg 429]
very popular in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Pamphilus
(or Panphylus) is the name of the lover who sustains the chief part,
but others besides Gower have supposed it to be also the name of the
author. The line referred to here is,

âProuidet et tribuit deus et labor omnia nobis,â (f. 6 v
o
).

I quote from a copy of a rare fifteenth-century edition
(without date or place, but supposed to have been printed about 1490
at Rome), in the Douce collection, Bodleian Library. It has the title
âPanphylus de amore,â and ends, âExplicit amorem per tractus (i.e.
pertractans) Panphyli codex.â The book is not without some merit
of its own, though to a great extent it is an imitation of Ovid.
It is quoted several times by Albertano of Brescia in his
Liber
Consolationis
, and was evidently regarded as a serious authority:
see Chaucerâs
Tale of Melibee
, which is ultimately derived
from the
Liber Consolationis
. It is referred to also in the

Frankeleins Tale
, 381 f.,

âUnder his brest he bar it more secree

Than ever did Pamphilus for Galathee.â

14462.
au labourer covient
, âit is necessary to labour.â

14466. âWhoso wishes,â &c., i.e. âif a man wishesâ: see note on 1244.

14473.
dispense
, âdeals favourablyâ: cp. l. 1400.

14496.
le meulx
: see note on 2700.

14551. Matt. vi. 33.

14568. The alteration of âcontemplaciounâ to âcontempler,â used as a
substantive as in l. 10699, is the simplest way of restoring the metre:
but cp. 3116, and
Bal.

14581. Isid.

volunt eo fine tantum ut sciant, et turpis curiositas est. Et sunt qui

14670. A reference to the story of St. Jerome being chastised in a
dream by an angel because he studied the style of his writing overmuch,
and was becoming âCiceronianusâ rather than âChristianus.â

14701. For the four bodily temperaments, cp.
Conf. Am.
vii. 393
ff.

14707. âIf I be tempered so as to be phlegmaticâ: cp.
Bal.
l. 2,
âCeo qâainz fuist aspre, amour le tempre suef.â

14725. This refers to the so-called âSalvatio Romae,â the story of
which is told (for example) in the
Seven Sages
.

14730.
fesoit avant
, âhe proceeded to makeâ: cp. 17310, 18466,
20537.

14757. An absolute construction, âwith the sword of penitence in his
hand.â

14769.
en tiel devis
, answered by âDont,â âin the manner by
which,â &c.

[Pg 430]

14776. I do not understand this. âMalgrÃ© le soenâ might perhaps mean
âin spite of itself,â as âmalgrÃ© soenâ is sometimes used, but how about
âde sa casselleâ?

14797. 1 John iv. 1.

14812. Ecclus. xxxii. 24.

14833. It is needless to say that Boethius gives no such directions.
They are the usual questions of the priest in enjoining penance,
âQuis, quid, ubi, per quos, quotiens, quomodo, quandoâ: cp. Myrcâs

Instructions for Parish Priests
(E.E.T.S. 1868). The name of
âBoeceâ perhaps crept in by accident in the place of some other,
because the writer had in his mind the quotation given at 14899.

14854.
quâil est atteins
, âto which he has reached,â i.e. âin
which he is.â

14862.
forain
, here used in opposition to âbenoit,â âsacred,â
meaning that which is outside the consecrated limits.

14899. This is from Boethius,
Cons. Phil.
i. Pr. 4, âSi operam
medicantis expectas, oportet ut vulnus detegas tuum.â

14901.
Sicomme la plaie
, &c. This seems to depend on
âdescoverir,â âhow large and grievous the wound is.â

14932.
Y falt
, âthere is needed.â

14945 f. âAccording to the exact measure of the delight taken in the

15110. Job vii. 1, âMilitia est vita hominis super terram.â Not the
same in A. V.

15194. These are the opening words of the Institutions of Justinian:
âIustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas ius suum cuique tribuens.â

15205. The sense of this might easily be got from Plato, but of course
the citation is not at first hand.

15217.
Civile
is no doubt âla loy civile,â referred to in 14138,
15194, &c. We find âCivileâ as here in l. 16092 in a connexion which
leaves no doubt of its meaning, and again 22266. Civile, it will be
remembered, is a personage in
Piers Plowman
.

: a reference to the shrine of St. James at
Compostella and the rich offerings made there.

15337. This might be a reference to Aristotle,

but of course it is not taken at first hand.

15371. âEven though he should have to pay double the (usual) price,â

Here âdu quoyâ is used like the modern âde
quoi,â and so elsewhere, e.g. 15819, and âquoyâ 15940; but sometimes
we have âdu quoy dont,â e.g. 3339, where it seems to pass from an
interrog. pron. into a substantive, and âquoyâ is used simply as a
substantive in some passages, e.g. 1781, 12204, meaning âthingâ: cp.
the use of âwhatâ in English,
Conf. Am.
i. 1676.

15505. See note on l. 7640. The reference here is to Godfrey of
Winchester,

15563.
par sa ruine Sâen vole
means perhaps, âhe precipitated
himself from his place and flew away.â

15566. Is. lxvi. 1, 2: but the quotation is not exact.

15578. Job xxvii. 8; but, as in the quotation above from Isaiah,
something is added to make a special application. The original is only,
âQuae est enim spes hypocritae, si avare rapiat?â with no mention of
almsgiving.

15593. Jer. xii. 13, but again the quotation has its special
application given by our author. The original is âSeminaverunt triticum

15821.
lÃ©e
: a form (properly fem.) of âlet,â from Lat. âlatus,â
equivalent to âlarge,â 15824, to be distinguished from âliet,â âlÃ©e,â
from âlaetus.â

15822.
allegger

distinguished from âallegger,â âalleviate.â

15867. Matt. xix. 29.

sur tiele gent et toy
: apparently for âsur toy et tiele
gent,â âon thyself and on such people as thou shalt see most worthy of
thy liberality.â

15949. See note on 7640. The reference here is to Godfrey of
Winchester,

15954. Cic.
de Off.

15963. âAttempranceâ however is already in the retinue of Justice, see
15232, and âDiscrecioun,â who is the third daughter of Humility, 11562,
and therefore herself the mistress of a household, is also in the
employ of Abstinence, 16323.

15985. Ps. xx. 4 (

16045. Ecclus. xli. 15, but the special application is by our author.

16060. Prov. xxii. 1.

16073. The cry of heralds was âLargesce!â addressed to the knights
whose prowess they recorded. Here the poor with their cry of
âLargesce!â are the heralds by whom the praise of the liberal man is
brought before the throne of God.

16092. âBy breach of Canon law or Civil.â

16100. Cp.
Conf. Am. Prol.
207 ff., where the âlettersâ are also
mentioned.

16138. The MS. has âSa viele loy,â which can hardly stand.

16181.

16192.
comblera
: fut. for subj. in dependent command, as 416,
1184, &c.

16203 ff. This passage seems to need some emendation. Perhaps we might
read âestâ for âaâ in l. 16203, and âLesâ for âDesâ in 16206, setting
a colon after âtrahi.â But I have no confidence that this is what the
author intended.

16231.

to avoid it.

16285.

16327.
toute voie
, nevertheless, like the modern âtoutefois.â

16338.
parentre deux
, âbetween two thingsâ: cp. 1178,

Bal.
xxvii. 4, &c. In the Table of Contents âparentre deuxâ
seems to be for âparentre dâeux,â and so it might be in some other
places, e.g.
Trait.
xv. 2, as âentre dâeuxâ in
Mir.
874;
but this is not the case in 1178, nor probably in the other passages
where it occurs.

almost equivalent to âoffspring.â

The substance of the stanza is taken from Jerome
adv. Jov.

16670. Perhaps Ecclus. xx. 7.

16673. A similarly severe moral judgment is pronounced upon Ulysses
in

is repeatedly mentioned, e.g. ll. 9949, 10911,

This need not be altered to âsupponer,â but
may be the same as the French âsoupoierâ âto support,â cp. Lydgateâs
âsopouailleâ or âsowpowaylle,â in the

17067. Cp.
Conf. Am.
v. 6395* ff. Gregory says (i.
Reg.
Expos.
v. 3) âincomparabili gratia Spiritus sancti efficitur, ut
a manentibus in carne carnis corruptio nesciatur.â But the quotation
here and in the
Conf. Am.
seems to be not really from Gregory,
but from Guibert or Gilbert (Migne
Patrol.
vol. clvi.), who says
of virginity âadeo excellit ut in carne praeter carnem vivere ut vere
angelica dicta sit,â
Mor. in Gen.
v. 17; unless indeed he is
quoting from Gregory. For Gilbert see 17113.

17074. Gen. i. 27.

[Pg 436]

17089. Cp.

xvi. and
Conf. Am.
v. 6395 ff. The text
of the
Confessio Amantis
makes Valentinianâs age âan hundred
wynter,â but the Latin margin both there and in the
TraitiÃ©

calls him âoctogenarius.â

17103. Num. xxxi. 17 f.

17113. This is the Gilbert mentioned in the note on l. 17067. He was
abbot of S. Marie de Nogent in the early part of the twelfth century.

17417. Tobit iii. 8, and vi. 13, 14, but nothing is said distinctly of
the reason here assigned. It may be thought that it is implied in Tobit
viii. 9. The idea is fully developed in the
Confessio Amantis
,
where the whole story is told with this motive and in connexion with
the same argument about chastity in the state of marriage. See

five points, and that in a somewhat different form from our authorâs:
âHonour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents,
that I may hear good report of thee.â The Vulgate reading is, âMonentes

The original of it is perhaps Jerome
adv. Jovin.
i. 16, âNuptiae
terram replent, virginitas paradisum.â Much the same thing is said by
Augustine and by others.

17945. Jerome,

Confessio
Amantis
v. 6372 ff. with a slight variation in the details, and it
is alluded to in
Vox Clam.
vi. 1323. It is to be noted that the
same corruption of the original name Spurina, into âPhirinus,â is found
in all three.

The lines corresponding to 18301 f. are

a large portion of the

inclusive.

18445. The assertion that he is merely giving voice to public opinion
is more than once repeated by our author in his several works, e.g.

Conf. Am. Prol.
122 ff.

18451. Simon Magus is the representative of spiritual corruption,
called âsimony.â His name is similarly used in our authorâs other
works, e.g.
Conf. Am. Prol.
204, 439, and often in the
Vox

. With the argument here compare
Vox Clam.

Claues thesauri regis habere sibi.â

18556. Cp.
Conf. Am. Prol.
206 ff., where the parallel is very
close.

18580. The allusion is to the cross upon the reverse of the English
gold coinage of Edward IIIâs time, as also on that of some other
countries and perhaps on the pound sterling, see 25270.

18584.
cil huissier
, âthe doorkeepers.â

18589. This form of sentence is characteristic of our author: cp.

Bal.
xviii. 2,

âTiel esperver crieis unqes ne fu,

Qe jeo ne crie plus en ma maniere.â

Also
Bal.
vii. 4, xxx. 2,
Conf. Am.
i. 718 and frequently
in the
Vox Clamantis
, e.g. i. 499 ff.

18631. Referring to the payments made by Jews and prostitutes at Rome
for liberty to live and exercise their professions.

18637. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 283 ff. and
Conf. Am.
ii. 3486
ff.

18649. John xiv. 27. The discourse however is not to St. Peter alone,
cp. 18733.

18663.
des bonnes almes retenir
, for âde retenir les bonnes
almes,â âin keeping guard over soulsâ: cp. 5492, &c. For the substance
of the passage cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 344,

âHic animas, alius querit auarus opes,â

where âHicâ is St. Peter and âaliusâ the modern Pope.

18672. âAs long as physic may availâ to save us from it.

18673. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 343 ff. and
Conf. Am. Prol.
212
ff. In the latter we have a pretty literal translation of l. 18675,

âOf armes and of brigantaille,â

which seems to mean âof regular or irregular troops.â

18721.
faisons que sage
: cp. 16700.

18733. Matt. xxiii. 8-10.

18737. Rev. xix. 10. Precisely the same application of this passage is
made in
Vox Clam.
iii. 957 ff.

18761 f. âthat he distinguished his cardinals by their red hats.â

[Pg 440]

18779. With this stanza cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 11 ff.

18783.
Innocent.
This must be taken to be a reference to the
Pope generally and not pressed as an evidence of date. Innocent VI, the
only pope of this name in the fourteenth century, died in 1362, whereas
we see from 18829 ff. that this work was not completed until after the
schism of the year 1378.

18793 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1247 ff.,

âAntecristus aget que sunt contraria Cristo,

Mores subuertens et viciosa fouens:

Nescio si forte mundo iam venerat iste,

Eius enim video plurima signa modo.â

18797. âWhat think you of whether such an one has yet come? Yes, for
truly pride now rises above humilityâ &c. That this is the meaning
is clear from the above-quoted passage of the
Vox Clamantis
.
I assume that the author is now speaking in his own person again,
notwithstanding ânostre courtâ below, which occurs also in other
places, e.g. 18873.

18805.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1271,

âIn cathedram Moysi nunc ascendunt Pharisei,

Et scribe scribunt dogma, nec illud aguntâ

and
Conf. Am. Prol.
304 ff.,

âAnd thus for pompe and for beyete

The Scribe and ek the Pharisee

Of MoÃ¯ses upon the See

In the chaiere on hyh ben set.â

18829 ff. A reference to the schism of the papacy, which must have
taken place during the composition of this work: see Introduction p.
xlii.

18840 (R).
solonc ce que lâen vait parlant
: cp. 19057 ff. and
such expressions as âsecundum commune dictumâ in the headings of the
chapters of the
Vox Clamantis
, e.g. iii. ch. 15.

18848.
Maisque
, apparently here the same as âmais.â

18876.
verra
: fut. of âvenirâ instead of the usual âvendra.â
Burguy (i. 397) does not admit the form for the Norman dialect, but it
was used in Picardy. Usually âverraiâ is the future of âveoir,â e.g.
19919, as in modern French.

18889 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1341 ff.,

âCuius honor, sit onus; qui lucris participare

Vult, sic de dampnis participaret eis:

Sic iubet equa fides, sic lex decreuit ad omnes,

Set modo qui curant ipsa statuta negant.â

18925. 2 Kings v.

18997. The story is alluded to in much the same connexion
Vox
Clam.
iii. 249,

âAlcius ecce Simon temptat renouare volatum.â

19031.
sâil sa garde pance
, &c., âif he neglects his
belly-armour of
[Pg 441]
antidoteâ: âgarde panceâ is to be taken as practically
one word, though not written so in the MS. The idea is that the Pope
has to take the precaution of an antidote against poison with all his
meals.

19044. âas a chicken does the hen,â i.e. âfollows the henâ; a good
instance of the use of âfaireâ often noted before.

19057 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii.
Prol.
11 ff.,

âA me non ipso loquor hec, set que michi plebis

Vox dedit, et sortem plangit vbique malam;

Vt loquitur vulgus loquor,â &c.

There, as here, the excuse is prefatory to an attack on
Church dignitaries.

19113.
persuacioun
: five syllables in the metre.

19117. The application of this reference, which is here lost, may be
supplied from
Vox Clam.
iii. 1145 ff., where the instance is
quoted, as here, in condemnation of the laxity of bishops.

19315. The leaf which is here lost contained the full number of 192
lines without any rubric, as we may see by the point at which the
present stanza begins. The author is still on the subject of bishops.

19333 ff. With the substance of this and the following stanza cp.

Conf. Am. Prol.
449 ff.

19345. An unfavourable view of the bee is generally taken by our
author: cp. 5437 ff.

19372 f. âThe wanton prelate, who is bound to God, separates himself
grievously from him by reason of the stingâ: âqâa dieu se joyntâ seems
only meant to express the fact that by his office he is near to God.

19377. Referring to some such passage as Gal. v. 16 f.

19380. âwould be in better case if they had no sting.â

19407. Cp. Chaucer,
Persones Tale
, 618 (Skeat): âAnd ofte tyme
swich cursinge wrongfully retorneth agayn to him that curseth, as a
brid that retorneth agayn to his owene nest.â

19411.
Du quelle part
, âin whatever direction.â

19457.
Sâen fuit
: apparently used in the same sense as âfuit,â
with âsainte oreisounâ as direct object.

19501 f. Evidently a play upon the words âphesant,â âfaisant,â and
âvin,â âdivin,â as afterwards âcoupe,â âculpe.â

19505 f. âRather than to correct and attend to the fault of the
Christian man.â This use of âpourâ has been noticed before, 6328, &c.

19891. The two leaves which are lost contained the full number of 384
lines, and we are still on the subject of bishops.

19897. Not Solinus, so far as I know.

19907. 1 Tim. iii. 1.

19941.
la divine creature
, âGodâs creature.â

19945. 1 Sam. xii. 19 ff.

19948. âwas not disturbed in his charity.â

19949.
ne place a dieu
, &c., âGod forbid that I should not pray
for you.â

[Pg 442]

19957. Jer. ix. 1, âQuis dabit capiti meo aquam, et oculis meis fontem
lacrymarum?â &c.

19968. Presumably we should read either âdu prelatâ or âdes prelatz.â

19971. Possibly Is. lxiii. 3, 5, but it is not an exact quotation.

19972 f. âHe looked, but there was none of the people who regarded, or
who sighed for his sufferings.â

19981. Val. Max. v. 6, but he does not give the name of the enemy
against whom the war was made, therefore the story is perhaps not taken
directly from him. The story is in
Conf. Am.
vii. 3181 ff.,
beginning,

âfor this Valeire tolde,

And seide hou that be daies olde

Codrus,â &c.

19984.
ceaux dâOrense
: in the
Conf. Am.
âayein Dorrence.â
The war is said by some authorities to have been âin Dorienses,â and
this is no doubt what is meant, but there is evidently a discrepancy
here between the
Mirour
and the
Confessio Amantis
with
regard to the name. The MS. reading here is of course âdorense.â

19995.
proprement
, âfor his own part,â i.e. âhimself.â

19996. âor suffer his people to be killed.â

20014.
mais pour cherir
, âexcept for taking care of.â

20016. Judas is the type of those who fall by transgression from their
bishoprics.

20019. Luke x. 30 ff. The âdeaconâ here stands for the Levite of the
parable.

20035. Zech. x. 3, âSuper pastores iratus est furor meus, et super
hircos visitabo.â

20042. Perhaps Is. xxix. 15.

20053. This must be a reference to Matt. xxiii. 13, attributed by
mistake to Isaiah.

20065 ff. This is also in
Conf. Am.
v. 1900 ff. with a reference
to Gregoryâs Homilies, and referred to more shortly in
Vox Clam.

iii. 903 ff.

20109.
de celle extente
, âto that extent.â This seems
practically to be the meaning; that is, so far forth as the purse
extends.

20120.
la coronne
: evidently this indicates the tonsured priest,
whose circle of unshorn hair was supposed to represent the crown of
thorns. As to the following lines, we must take them to mean âif you
read the sequence of the Gospel you will know who is meant,â the
relative being used in the same way as in 1244, &c.

20123.
son incest
: see note on 9085.

20126 f. âoffices fall to the lot of different persons at different
times.â

20140. âThere is no one by whom they may be corrected.â

20153 ff. âThere are those who farm out prostitution as if it were
property of land and tillage.â

[Pg 443]

20161. This stanza is very closely parallel with
Conf. Am. Prol.

407-413,

âAnd upon this also men sein,

That fro the leese which is plein

Into the breres thei forcacche

Here Orf, for that thei wolden lacche,

With such duresce and so bereve

That schal upon the thornes leve

Of wulle, which the brere hath tore.â

Cp. also
Vox Clam.
iii. 195 f.

20178.
Pour dire
&c., to be connected with âce ne te puet
excuserâ: âit cannot excuse you to sayâ &c., âpourâ standing for âde,â
as often.

20195.
ma bource estuet
: this looks like a personal use of
âestovoir,â but presumably âma bourceâ is a kind of object, âit is
necessary for my purse,â as in phrases like âmâestuet.â

20197 ff. Cp. Chaucer,
C. T. Prol.
658,

âPurs is the erchedeknes helle.â

20200. âIt is of a piece with this, that he uses no other virtue to
correct me, provided that I give him my substance.â

20225 ff. The substance of this is repeated in
Vox Clam.
iii.
1403 ff.

20244.
entribole
: we might equally well read âen tribole,â
âdisturbs by it.â

20247 ff. To this corresponds
Vox Clam.
iii. 1351 ff.

20250.
puist
, properly pret. subjunctive.

20287 ff. Cp.
Vox Clamantis
, iii. 1375 ff.,

âLittera dum Regis papales supplicat aures,

Simon et est medius, vngat vt ipse manus,â &c.

20294.
sâabsentont.
Note the rhyme on the weak final syllable,
so below âesperontâ: the irregularity is perhaps due to the similarity
in appearance of the future form, e.g. âavanceront,â âresponderont.â

20305 ff. With this compare
Vox Clam.
iii. 1487 ff.

20308.
easera
: fut. for pres. subj. expressing purpose: cp. 364.

20313. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1509 ff.,

âStat sibi missa breuis, devocio longaque campis,

Quo sibi cantores deputat esse canes:

Sic lepus et vulpes sunt quos magis ipse requirit;

Dum sonat ore deum stat sibi mente lepus.â

20318.
avant
, to be taken here perhaps as strengthening âPlusâ:
but see note on 20537.

20344 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1549-1552.

20355. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1519 ff.,

âDum videt ipse senem sponsum sponsam iuuenemque,

Tales sub cura visitat ipse sua;

Suplet ibi rector regimen sponsi, que decore

Persoluit sponse debita iura sue.â

[Pg 444]

20401. Matt. xv. 14.

20425 ff. Note the loose usage of the conditional in this stanza for
future, pres. subj., and in the sense noticed on l. 1688.

20441.
au primer divis
, âfirstlyâ; so âau droit devis,â
ârightly.â

20449. Cp. Greg.
Ep.
vi. 57 (end).

20462. Probably Hos. v. 4-7.

20488.
sâelle
, &c., âas to whether she,â &c.

20492. Perhaps Prov. vi. 27 ff.

20497 ff. The meaning of the word âannuelerâ which occurs in the
heading of the section is sufficiently explained in these lines. The
corresponding passage in the
Vox Clamantis
is iii. 1555 ff.

20527.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1559, âPlus quam tres dudum nunc exigit
unus habendum.â

20528.
mais
, for âmaisque,â âprovided that.â

20537.
avant
: used often with no particular meaning, cp. 20318.
Here we may take it with âdirrons,â âwhat shall we go on to say then,â
&c. It might, however, go with what follows, âtakes beforehand.â

20539.
a largesce
, âfreely bestowedâ: it would be of course a
provision in the will of the dead person.

20542.
ardante
, i.e. in purgatory.

20547. Cp. 1194, 10411.

20574. âSi diaconus sanctior episcopo suo fuerit, non ex eo quod
inferior gradu est apud Christum deterior erit.â

20576.
Par si qâ
: cp. 3233.

20582. âthat however great his learning may be.â

20594. Matt. v. 13, 14.

20621.
fait baraigner
: I take
fait
as auxiliary and

baraigner
to mean âmake barren.â

20700.
legende.
This probably means the passages of the Gospel
appointed to be read in the service of the Mass.

20713. The argument used by the priest is that his sin is no worse than
the same act in a layman. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1727 ff,

âDicunt presbiteri, non te peccant magis ipsi,

Dum carnis vicio fit sua victa caro:

Sicut sunt alii fragili de carne creati,

Dicit quod membra sic habet ipse sua.â &c.

20725 f.
Vox Clam.
iii. 1761,

Presbiter et laicus non sunt bercarius vnum,

Nec scelus in simili condicione grauat.

20740. Mal. i. 6, 7.

20785 ff.
Vox Clam.
iii. 2049 ff. The author is here dealing
with young students, âscolares.â

20793.
le meulx
: see note on 2700, so âle plusâ below.

20798. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iii. 2071 ff.

20827.
Vox Clam.
iii. 2074, âSi malus est iuvenis, vix bonus
ipse vetus.â

[Pg 445]

20832.
Qui
, âwhom.â

20833 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 1-676.

20845. This is a very hackneyed quotation, but the origin of it does
not seem quite clear; see note on Chaucer,
C.T. Prol.
179 in
Skeatâs edition: cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 277.

20866. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 26 f., âPellicibus calidis frigus et
omne fugant.â

20892.
mye et crouste
, âcrumb and crustâ in the modern sense of
the expression.

20905. See note on 12565. I do not know where this story comes from,
but somewhat similar tales of the devil visiting Macarius and his
monastery are to be found in the
Legenda Aurea
and elsewhere.

20952.
esloigner
, used with a personal object, âflee from.â

20989. Jerome,
Ep.
cxxv. 7, âSordidae vestes candidae mentis
indicia sunt.â

20999. Cp. Chaucer,
C.T. Prol.
193 f.

21001. I do not know anything about this story.

21061 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 371-388.

21076.
cloistrers
: i.e. those who remain within the monastery
walls.

21094.
qui sâest rendu
, âwho has delivered himself to God,â by
his profession: cp. 20988.

21118.
mais petit voy
, &c., âbut I see small number of them who,â
&c.

21133 ff. This passage, in which monastic virtues and vices are
personified with the title âdanzâ (Lat. âdompnusâ) which was given to
monks, has a parallel in
Vox Clam.
iv. 327 ff.

21134.
nâad mais refu
: apparently ârefuâ is here a past
participle; âhas been again no more,â i.e. has not survived.

21157. The criticism of the life of Canons follows here in the
Vox
Clamantis
also, iv. 347 ff.,

âUt monachos, sic Canonicos quos deuiat error,â &c.

The âCanons regularâ differed but little in their discipline from monks.

21166.
devant
: see 20909 ff.

21181. On the Mendicant orders see
Vox Clamantis
iv. 677 ff.

21190 f. âI have found out this about the order, that friars seek after
the world,â &c.: the perfect is used loosely for present. For âquerreâ
in this sense cp. 21528.

21197. 2 Cor. vi. 10.

21241. âThe friars go together in pairsâ: so in Chaucer,
Sompnours
Tale
, whence we learn that after having been fifty years in the
order they were relieved from this rule. In the next line âsanz partieâ
means âwithout separating.â The same word used in a different sense is
admissible as a rhyme: so âmestier,â 21275, and cp. note on 2353.

21250. Here, as elsewhere, it is implied that the friars made
themselves by preference the confessors of women, cp. 9148, Chaucer,

C.T. Prol.
215 ff.

[Pg 446]

21266. The marginal note opposite this stanza has lost the ends of its
lines by the cutting of the leaves of the MS. Its purport however is
clear enough, and it is certainly from the author. In
Vox Clam.

iv. 689, we have the substance of it,

âNon volo pro paucis diffundere crimen in omnes,

Spectetur meritis quilibet immo suis;

Quos tamen error agit, veniens ego nuncius illis,

Que michi vox tribuit verba loquenda fero.â &c.

The note perhaps may be read thus:

âNota quod super hii<s> que in ista pa<gina> secundum commune dictum
d<e fra>tribus scripta pa<tent>, transgressos simp<liciter> et non
alios mater<ia> tangit: vnde h<ii> qui in ordine transgressi sunt
ad <viam> reuertentes prius<quam> in foueam cada<nt> hac eminente
<scrip>tura cercius pre<mu>niantur.â

21301.
Flaterie professÃ©
, i.e. Flattery the friar.

21325 ff. This stanza is nearly a repetition of ll. 9145-9156.

21369. In Chaucer,
Sompnours Tale
, the sack is carried by a
âsturdy harlot,â who accompanied the two friars. At the present day the
Capuchin in his begging expeditions often goes alone and carries his
own sack.

21373 ff. Observe how clearly this agrees in substance with Chaucerâs
humorous description in the
Sompnours Tale
.

21376. âIf the woman has little or nothing to give,â like the widow in
Chaucerâs
Prologue
,

âYet wolde he have a ferthing or he wente.â

21377.
meinz
is rather confusedly put in with âne sâen
abstient.â The writer meant to say ânone the less does he demand,â &c.

21382. Matt. xxiii. 14.

21399. The quotation is actually from Hos. iv. 8. In
Vox Clam.

iv. 767, the same quotation is given in the same connexion and
attributed rightly to Hosea.

21403. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 1141 ff. The passage of the
Plowmans
Crede
relating to this subject is well known.

21449. An allusion to the story current about the death of the Emperor
Henry VII in the year 1313.

21455.
sâil volt lesser
, &c., âif you ask whether he will spare
us,â &c.

21469 ff. Chaucer,
C. T. Prol.
218 ff.,

âFor he hadde power of confessioun,

As seyde himself, more than a curat.â

The confessor would claim the right of burial, if it were worth having:
cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 735 ff.,

âMortua namque sibi, quibus hic confessor adhesit,

Corpora, si fuerint digna, sepulta petit;

Sed si corpus inops fuerit, nil vendicat ipse,â &c.

[Pg 447]

21477. For baptism there would be no fee: so
Vox Clam.
iv. 739
f.,

âBaptizare fidem nolunt, quia res sine lucro

Non erit in manibus culta vel acta suis.â

21481. Matt. vi. 25.

21499 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 815,

âAppetit ipse scolis nomen sibi ferre magistri,

Quem post exemptum regula nulla ligat:

Solus habet cameram, propriat commune, que nullum

Tunc sibi claustralem computat esse parem.â

21517. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 971 ff.

21536.
acomparas
: for this form of future cp. âcomparaâ 26578,
âduraâ 3909, &c.

21544. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 981 ff.

21562.

21604. Ps. lxxxiii. (
Vulg.

21607.
Brev. in Psalm.
lxxxii. 6; but our author has not quite
understood the explanation.

21610.
ou pitz
, i.e. âau pitz,â âin the breast.â

21625 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
iv. 787 f.,

âNomine sunt plures, pauci tamen ordine fratres;

Vt dicunt aliqui, Pseudo prophetat ibi.â

It seems that the word âpseudoprophetaâ used Rev. xix.
20 and elsewhere was read âpseudo propheta,â and âpseudoâ taken as a
proper name. At the same time this was combined with the idea of the
wolf in sheepâs clothing suggested by Matt. vii. 15, âAttendite a
falsis prophetis,â &c.

21637. âThe Pseudos whom men call friars.â

21641. âCannot fail to suffer for itâ: âcompereâ for âcompiereâ from
âcomparer,â which is usually transitive, like âacomparerâ 21536,
meaning âto pay for.â

21647. The reference is to 2 Pet. ii. 1-3, where âpseudoprophetaeâ is
the word used in the Vulgate.

21663 ff. The same argument as was before applied to the monks, 21061
ff.

21676.
nâen puet chaloir
: the meaning apparently is âit cannot
be doubted,â but I cannot clearly explain the phrase.

21739. The Apocalypse does not exactly say this, but it is apparently
our authorâs interpretation of ch. viii. 10, 12, or some such passage.

21754. âBut, before it do trouble us worse, it were well,â &c., âfaceâ
being used as auxiliary with âgrever.â

[Pg 448]

21769.
mâen soit au travers
, âshould be of the opposite opinion
to me on the subject.â

âsâaucun,â &c.

21780.
Encore ... plus
, âeven more (than I have said).â

21979. One leaf with its full number of 192 lines has here been cut
out. We find ourselves in the favourite story of Nebuchadnezzarâs pride
and punishment: cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 2785 ff., where it is told in
full detail. Here it is one of a series of examples to illustrate the
inconstancy of Fortune to those at the head of empires.

22002. The sense seems to require a negative here and in 22004.

22004.
de halt en bass
, â(bringing him) down from his height.â

22009. It is difficult to say what occasion precisely is referred to
here.

exact translation.

22125.

22158 ff. With these references to the former greatness and present
decay of Rome cp.

834-848.

22159.

: apparently used here as a feminine form, but
not so in 17120.

Troian
: this form of the name is used also in
Conf.
Am.
vii. 3144, and âTroianusâ in
Vox Clam.
vi. 1273. The
justice and humanity of Trajan were proverbial in the Middle Ages,
owing chiefly to the legend about him connected with Gregory the Great.

22182. âWell know I that this has not happened (for nought), but it is
because of our wanton life.â

22191.

, i.e. the Pope and the Emperor.

22192. âThe one is he who sets forth the will of holy Church,â i.e. the
Pope.

22201. This stanza seems to be a reference to the helplessness of the
Empire.

22273 ff. With these stanzas compare
Vox Clam.
vi. 589 ff.,
where there is the same reiterated personal address, âO rex,â âO bone
rex,â &c., but the substance of the advice is there specially adapted
to the age and circumstances of Richard II, whereas here it is general.

22292.
par halte enprise
, âloftilyâ: cp. l. 22077, and elsewhere.

22294. âand forces him to confess his errorâ: ârecreandiseâ is properly
the admission that one is vanquished, or the faintheartedness which
might lead to such an admission.

22333. 2 Maccabees xi. 1-12.

22341. The number given is 11,000 footmen and 1600 horsemen.

22350. Lev. xxvi. 17.

22744. After the omission of 384 lines (two leaves cut out), we find

[Pg 449]
ourselves again in the story of Nebuchadnezzar: cp.
Conf. Am.

v. 7017 ff. Here it seems to be used as a warning against excess of
drinking and other such vices, whereas there it is an example of
sacrilege. For the form of sentence here, âMais cil qâestoit,â &c., cp.

Conf. Am.
v. 6925, vi. 2250, &c.

22765. 3 Esdras iii. f. The story is told at length in
Conf. Am.

vii. 1783 ff., where the number of persons who give answers is three,
the third giving two opinions, as in the original. Here no doubt the
author is trusting to his memory.

22962. âThere is no one whom David will teach by his example,â i.e. who
will follow Davidâs example.

22965. That is, for the French the harping is out of tune, because they
do not accept their rightful ruler.

22967. With this question cp.
Conf. Am. Prol.
1053 ff.,

âBot wolde god that now were on

An other such as Arion,â &c.

23216. Cp. 5459.

23370. The quotation is actually from Juvenal, but it is attributed
to Horace both here and in
Conf. Am.
vii. 3581. The lines are

Sat.
viii. 269 ff.,

âMalo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis

Aeacidae similis Vulcaniaque arma capessas,

Quam te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.â

Our author no doubt picked up the quotation in a
common-place book. He refers to âOraceâ also in ll. 3804 and 10948,
the true reference in the latter case being to Ovid, while the former
quotation is really from Horace.

23393. The âpigasâ is the long-pointed shoe worn by fashionable people
at the time. âNot one of these rich men is born with his pointed shoe,â
says the author.

23413. âMuch is that bird to be blamed,â &c. Cp.
Vox Clam.
v.
835 f.,

âTurpiter errat auis, proprium que stercore nidum,

Cuius erit custos, contaminare studet.â

23492.
si te pourvoie
, âand provide thyself (accordingly).â

23500. Probably Matt. vi. 19.

23534. âThat the law excuses youâ: âdespenser avecâ is used similarly
in l. 1400.

23573 f.
se delitera ... tout avant
, âwill go on taking
pleasure.â

23582.
a ce qâen ce termine
, &c., âaccording as the matter
appears in regard to this order,â i.e. what lies within the limits of
this class: cp. 16151.

23607.
Qe nous ne devons
, âso that we may not,â so also in
23640; see note on 1193.

23638. âAt the making of the new knightâ: a curious use of the gerund.

23659.
au prodhomme
, âto be valiant.â

23671.
lâonour de France
: the particular name of the country is
of no consequence and is determined probably by the rhyme. That the
general point of view is not a continental one is shown by 23713.

23683.
jours dâamour
, âlove-days,â for reconciliation of those
who had differences.

23701 ff. Cp.
Vox Clam.
v. 519 f.

[Pg 451]

23704 ff. âIf anyone pays him well, he will show himself valiant at the
sessions.â

23722 ff. âThough the heralds cry little to him for largess, yet he
gives the poor reason to complainâ: he robs the poor without the excuse
of being generous to others out of the proceeds.

23726.
un chivaler de haie
, âa hedgerow knight.â

23732 ff. Terms of war are ironically used: he draws up his court in
order of battle and throws into confusion the jury-panell, to support
his friends and dismay their poorer opponents.

23755.
du loy empereour
, âby the law of the emperor.â

nâad garde de
, âdoes not keep himself from.â

The precise number is of no importance, cp.
24958. In
Conf. Am.
ii. 97, the author says âmo than twelveâ in
a similar manner.

23869.

The author apparently will not admit the

24097. This denunciation of war is quite characteristic of the author:
cp.

122-192.

âThe world empeireth every day.â

: so âvei cy,â 23688.

24226 ff. i.e. he will not undertake the cause which is not favoured by
fortune. The âdouble aceâ would of course be the lowest throw with two
dice, and âsixesâ the highest.

24255 ff. Cp.

Des tieux
, âsuch persons,â subject of the verb.

24272 f. âNeither his nature nor his strain is seasoned with justice.â

24290. The word âmireâ seems here to be used for a surgeon as
distinguished from a physician: that, however, is not its ordinary use.

24325.

, like âQuiqueâ in 24313, âWhosoever may have to pay,
these will get exemption, if they can.â

24326.

I take this to be for âa paier,â like âaffaireâ

The metaphor is from hounds being trained

succeeding lines.

24379. Cp.
Vox Clam.
vi. 251,

âSi cupit in primo, multo magis ipse secundo,â

i.e. âin primo gradu,â which is that of âApprentis,â the second being
that of âSergant.â

24398. Matt. xix. 29, but the quotation is not quite accurate.

24435.
Sur son sergant
: the double meaning of âsergantâ is
played upon, as in âQui sert au siecle,â 24415.

24440.

author goes on to say, poor people cannot afford to buy in their market.

24625. For the metre cp. 2742, 26830: see Introd. p. xlv.

24646. âBut advanced my unjust cause,â &c. This position of âainzâ is

as usual runs parallel to this, with
the heading, âHic loquitur de errore Vicecomitum, Balliuorum necnon et
in assisis Iuratorum,â &c., vi. 419 ff.

24832. For the order of words cp. 24646.

24852. âHis conscience will not fail him,â that is, will not be an
obstacle.

[Pg 453]

24858.
il nâest pas si nice
, âhe is not so nice,â i. e. not
so careful about it. The word ânice,â meaning originally âignorant,â
âfoolish,â passes naturally to the meaning of âfoolishly scrupulousâ in
a half ironical sense, as here.

24917.
enmy la main.
As âdevant la main,â âapres la main,â mean
âbeforehandâ and âafterwards,â this apparently is âmeanwhile.â

ribalds
: observe the rhyme, showing that the âdâ is not
sounded.

24996. A proverbial expression, which occurs also in 15405 f.

25021 ff. I do not clearly understand the first lines of the stanza.
Perhaps it means, âFor the expense to which you go in buying their
perjury they pay (or suffer) the burdening of their conscience.â Then
afterwards, âThe bribe is enough for them by way of evidence, for
covetousness dispenses them from anything moreâ: âove leur dispense,â
âarranges with themâ that this shall be enough.

25261 ff. âFraud may have large dealings, but he has small honesty
when he buys and sells by different standards of weight.â The idea is
apparently that the buyer is deceived as to the true market price when
wholesale dealings are carried on with weights nominally the same but
really different, as when the merchant buys coal by the ton of 21 cwt.

used with names of various coins, as âlivre parisie,â but often also by
itself to denote some coin of small value, in phrases such as we have
here.

25607. For this function of St. Michael cp. 13302. Here the point
suggested is that the seller ought to be reminded by his balance of

25826. âWill see their halls carpetedâ (or âcovered with tapestryâ), so
âencourtinerâ below; a loose employment of the infinitive.

25839 ff. Observe the confusion of 2nd pers. sing. and 2nd pers. plur.
in this stanza, especially âtu gaignerezâ in 25842. Even if we take
âbaillerez,â âgaignerez,â &c., as rhyme-modifications of âgaigneras,â
&c., this will not go for âavisez,â which must be meant for 2nd pers.
plur. pres. subj.: cp. 442, &c.

25853. This would be to avoid arrest. The liberty of St. Peter would
perhaps be the precincts of Westminster Abbey, that of St. Martin might
be the Church of St. Martin in the Fields: but perhaps no definite
reference is intended. He takes advantage of the sanctuary to make
terms with his creditors.

usual meaning âprovided thatâ; cp. 26927.

26120.
brusch.
The occurrence of this word here in a connexion
which leaves no doubt of its identity is worth remark: see

under âbrusque,â âbrisk,â âbrussly.â

26130.
au sojour
, âat their easeâ in their tavern: âsojourâ
means properly âstayâ in a place, hence ârestâ or ârefreshmentâ: cp.
the uses of the verb âsojourner.â

26133.

narrative portion of the
Mirour

27949. There may be some doubt here as to the arrangement of the
inverted commas; but it seems best to take the whole of this stanza
as direct report, in which case âIlâ in 27950 refers to âGod.â The
sentence below is a little disordered, as is often the case with our
author: âHe showed thee a special sign six months since in thy cousin
Elizabeth, who was barren, but God,â &c. Cp. 17996,

, âfor his part,â one of those rather
meaningless phrases, such as âendroit de soy,â âen son degrÃ©,â âau

29264.
tâencline
, âbows to theeâ: the verb is intransitive and
the pronoun dative.

29390. The word âpensÃ©eâ counts as three syllables in this line,
whereas usually the termination â-Ã©eâ in Anglo-Norman verse of this
period is equivalent to â-Ã©â; cp. 29415. Perhaps we should read
âpenseie;â see Introduction p. xx.

29798. âWitness thy Gospels,â i.e. âthe witness is that of thy Gospels.â

29821.
le livre
: cp. 27475 ff., where it is implied that the
author follows a Latin book.

29869.

, âtells me.â

29878 ff. âBut in order that it may perchance please thee, I set all my
business, as best I may, to do honour to thy person.â I have separated
âMaisque,â because that seems necessary for the sense. The author hopes
that, though his Lady has the crown of heaven, yet she may be pleased
by his humble endeavours to do her honour on earth.

29890.
tâen fais continuer
, âthou dost continue in the work,â a
reflexive use of âcontinuerâ with âfaireâ as auxiliary.

DEDICATION OF BALADES

I. 7. âHe who trusts in God,â &c. âQeâ is used for âQui.â

15.
Vostre oratour.
The poet means no doubt to speak of himself
as one who is bound to pray for the king. At the same time it is to
be noticed that âOrator regiusâ was at the beginning of the sixteenth
century an official title, borne by Skelton in the reign of Henry VIII,
and perhaps nearly equivalent to the later âPoet-laureate.â Skelton
was âlaureatusâ of the Universities, that is he had taken a degree in
rhetoric and poetry at Oxford, and apparently something equivalent at
Cambridge.

16. The pronunciation of the name âGowerâ as a dissyllable with the
accent on the termination, which is required here and in the Envoy
to the
TraitiÃ©
, is the same as that which we have in the

Confessio Amantis
viii. 2908, where it rhymes with â-er.â

23.
perfit
: so written in full in the MS. and correctly given by
the Roxburghe editor. Dr. Stengel gives âparfitâ on the assumption that
there is a contraction. That is not so here, but in many cases of this
kind he is right.

24.
sentence
: so in MS. (not with a capital as in the Roxb.
ed.). The same remark applies to âvalourâ in ii. l. 33, âsâestâ in

Bal.
vii. l. 18, âlettreâ xviii. l. 24, xx. l. 25, xxii. l. 27,
âlorsâ xxxvi. l. 3, âse,â xxxvi. l. 10, âhelasâ xliii. l. 6, âvousâ
xlix. l. 23.

[Pg 461]

O recolende
, &c.

8. After this line probably one has dropped out, for when this piece
appears (in a somewhat different form) among the Latin poems of the All
Soulsâ and Glasgow MSS. we have

âRex confirmatus, licet vndique magnificatus,

Sub Cristo gratus viuas tamen immaculatus,â

and âlicetâ seems to require some such addition.

The quotation âNichil proficietâ is from Ps. lxxxix. (
Vulg.

lxxxviii.) 23, and the other from Ps. xli. (
Vulg.
xl.) 2.

II. This balade has been printed hitherto as if it consisted of four
stanzas only, but in the MS., which is here damaged, there is not only
space for another, but the initials of its lines still remain.

20.
vendra
: the reading âvoudraâ is a mistake due to the Roxb.
edition.

26. For the conjectural ending of the line cp.
Mirour
26423.

BALADES

Title.
âThis is partly lost by the damage to the leaf of the
MS., which has been mentioned above. The fragments of the latter part
seem to indicate that the whole series of balades was expressly written
by the author for the entertainment of the court of Henry IV: cp. D.
ii. l. 27 f. The end of it perhaps ran thus, âad fait, dont les nobles
de la Court se puissent duement desporter,â or something to that effect.

I. All that remains of the first stanza is the endings of the first
three lines, and more than half of the second stanza is also lost.

16.
Moun.
Forms such as this, e.g. âsoun,â âdoun,â ânoun,â
âbountÃ©,â and the â-ounâ terminations in xxi. and elsewhere, usually
appear with âoÌ
nÌ
â in the MS. Note however that ânounâ is written fully
in xxi. ll. 25, 27.

17.
voldroit
: a common use of the conditional in our author,
cp.
Mir.
l. 25. Here it is answered by the future âaverai.â
The meaning seems to be âIf God should put an end to my happiness and
to my life at once, my faith being unbroken, I should be content; but
meanwhile I remain true to thee always, whatever may befall.â

II. 4.
qâil sâesjoiera.
The Roxb. editor gave by mistake âqilsâ
for âqil,â out of which Dr. Stengel produces âqil ssesjoiera,â with the
remark âVerdoppelung anlautender Consonanten nach vocalischem Auslaut
auch sonst hÃ¤ufig.â The passages to which he refers in support of this
curious statement are ix. l. 13, where the Roxb. edition has âtanquil
lestâ by pure mistake for âtanquil sest,â and ix. l. 31, where he has
chosen to make âun ssiâ out of âuns si.â This shows the danger of
constructing a theory without ascertaining the facts.

9.
come.
Dr. Stengel is not right in proposing to read âcomâ
for
[Pg 462]
âcomeâ and âouâ for âove,â wherever the words occur. These words
regularly count as monosyllables for the metre, but the author much
more commonly wrote them with the final â-e.â Occasionally we have
âcomâ in the
Balades
(twice for instance in this stanza), and
once in the
Mirour
we have âouâ for âoveâ (l. 8376). Similarly
âpovere,â âyvere,â are regularly dissyllables by slurring of the
medial âe,â and are occasionally written âpovre,â âyvre.â On the other
hand âoreâ is sometimes a dissyllable, as
Bal.
xxviii. 1, and
sometimes a monosyllable, as
Mir.
37, 1775, &c., and some words
such as âaverai,â âoveraigne,â âyveresce,â vary between the longer and
the shorter form.

12.
com
: so in MS., wrongly âcomeâ in Roxb. edition, which also
has âviveetâ wrongly for âvive etâ of the MS.

23.
Et pensetz, dame.
An additional weak syllable is
occasionally found at the caesura in this metre: cp. xix. l. 20, xxiii.
l. 14, xxv. l. 8, &c., xxxiii. l. 10, xxxviii. l. 23, xliv. l. 8,
xlvi. l. 15,
Trait.
ii. l. 5, &c. In every case the additional
syllable is at a break after the second foot (epic caesura). It may
be a question, however, whether âdameâ should not be taken as a
monosyllable in some cases: see Introd. p. xxx.

III. 1.
celle
, used for the definite article: see note on

Mir.
301.

peigne
: this form of spelling does not indicate any difference
in pronunciation, for the rhymes âpleine,â âmeine,â are used to
correspond with it in the next stanza. It is intended to produce
visible conformity with the verb âcompleigne,â to which it rhymes, and
so in l. 15 we have âhalteigneâ pairing with âatteigne.â The verbal
ending âeigneâ rhymes regularly with âeineâ both in the French and
English of our author, and the âgâ often falls out of the spelling.

Milfoitz
: one word in the MS.; so âmillfoitzâ ix. l. 10.

16.

: so in the MS. The Roxb. ed. gives âsaâ by mistake.

IIII*. The number is repeated by inadvertence, so that the whole
series consists really of fifty-one balades, apart from the religious
dedication at the end and the Envoy.

4.
Por toi cherir

6328. The address in
the second person singular is unusual in the

and hardly
occurs except here and in the contemptuously hostile pieces, xli-xliii.

Usually the âplusâ of the second clause answers to some such word as
âtielâ in the first.

VIII. 17.
retenue

the Roxb. editor.

5.
Maisquâil vous pleust
, âprovided that it might please you,â
pret. subj.: âmaisqueâ in this sense is used either with indicative or

The reading âpar estesâ is a mistake; the MS. has
âpestes,â which might be either
perestes

, but

perest
occurs written out fully in
Mir.
1760, 2546.

dangerouse

illuminator) gives âLa.â

Chalandre

8.
Danger.
This name represents in the love-jargon of the
day those elements which are unfavourable to the loverâs acceptance
by his mistress, partly no doubt external obstacles, but chiefly
those feelings in the ladyâs own mind which tend towards prudence or
prompt to disdain. In the
Roman de la Rose
, which was the most
influential example of this kind of allegory, Danger is the chief
guardian of the rose-bush. He has for his helpers Malebouche, who
spreads unfavourable reports of the lover, with Honte and Paour, who
represent the feelings excited in the ladyâs mind leading her to resist
his advances.
[Pg 464]
Of these helpers the most valiant is Honte, daughter of
Raison and Mesfait. These all are the adversaries of the Lover and of
Bel-Acueil his friend and helper. See
Rom. de la Rose
ll. 2837
ff. Elsewhere the word âdangierâ is used for the scornfulness in love
of Narcissus,
Rom. de la Rose
1498,

âDu grant orguel et du dangier

Que Narcisus li ot menÃ©.â

or of the difficulties made by a mistress,

âOr puet o sâamie gesir,

Quâel nâen fait ne dangier ne plainte.â

Rom. de la Rose
21446 f.

Here the author says âDanger turns his eyes away,â that is, the ladyâs
feelings of disdain or reluctance deprive him of her favour, and in l.
19 he entreats her to remove âdangerâ from her regard. This idea is
illustrated further by the expressions in xxvi. l. 26,

âNe sai si vo danger le voet despire;â

and xxxvii. l. 20,

âVostre danger tantost mâad deslaiÃ©:â

where âdangerâ clearly stands for the ladyâs aversion to
the loverâs suit: see also xxiii. l. 10, xxx. l. 15 ff., and
Conf.
Am.
iv. 3589. In
Conf. Am.
iii. 1517 ff., and v. 6613 ff.,
Danger is very clearly described as the deadly enemy of the lover,
always engaged in frustrating his endeavours by his influence over
the lady. Note also the adjective âdangerousâ in the last balade; so
âdangereus,â
Rom. de la Rose
479, âgrudging,â and âdangerousâ in
the English translation, l. 1482, âdisdainful.â

11. The same complaint is made
Conf. Am.
v. 4490 ff., but the
reply there given (4542) is complete and crushing.

27.
Qâa
: the Roxb. ed. gives âQeâ by mistake for âQa.â

XIII. 1.
muance
, see Glossary. The Roxb. ed. gives ânivance,â
but the MS. reading seems to be rather âmvance,â the âvâ being written
for greater distinctness as in âremueâ xv. l. 8, &c. Certainly change
is more characteristic of March than snow, and it is the changes of his
fortune of which the lover complains,

âOre ai trovÃ©, ore ai perdu fiance.â

5. Cp.
Mir.
948.

8.
al oill

20. âI cannot fail to have the fortune of one (or the other),â i.e.
death or sickness. The word âtantâ in the line above is not answered by
anything and does not seem to mean much.

[Pg 465]

XV. 1.
creance
: see âcredentiaâ in Ducange. It means a cord for
confining the flight of falcons.

25. âAll my prayers are to your image at the time when,â &c.

27.
vostre proie
, âyour prey,â i. e. your possession by right of
capture.

XVI. 6 ff. âBut by feeding on this food of the mind I cannot, though I
seek it up and down, find for myself the path of grace.â The food he
feeds on is his feeling of hope: for âcelle senteâ = âla sente,â cp.
iii. 1, and see
Mir.
301.

26.
Qâes.
The confusion of singular and plural in the second
person is common in our author: see note on
Mir.
442.

(âQâesâ is of course for âQe es,â âqeâ or âqueâ being quite a regular
form of the relative used as subject by our author. I note this here
because Dr. Stengelâs remarks are misleading.)

28.
maisqâil vous talente
, âif only it be pleasing to you.â

XVII. 2.
Salvant lâestat dâamour
: a kind of apology for the idea
of blaming his mistress: cp. xxii. l. 26.

5.
guardon
: so written in full in the MS., cp. xxxiii. l. 6, so
that it is not a case of âfalsche AuflÃ¶sung,â as Dr. Stengel assumes.
He is right enough as regards âperleeâ l. 19, and âparcerâ xviii. l. 6.

27. âI cannot leave off from loving herâ: âmaisqueâ here âbut that,â
cp. xl. l. 7,
Trait.
xiv. l. 10.

XVIII. 11.
Qe jeo ne crie plus
: a favourite form of expression
with our author: cp. vii. l. 24, xxx. l. 13,
Mir.
18589.

17.
câest
, for âsâestâ: cp.
Mir.
1147.

XIX. 17.
proeu
, the same as âprouâ apparently: âproenâ can
hardly be right, though the MS. would equally admit that reading.

18.
trieus
: cp. xxxix. l. 15. The usual form in the

Mirour
is âtruis.â The Roxb. ed. has âcriensâ by mistake.

XX. 1.
Roe
: treated as a monosyllable in the verse here, but
otherwise in
Mir.
10942.

2. The position of the conjunction âmaisâ is characteristic of our
author, who frequently treats âandâ and âbutâ in the same way in the

Confessio Amantis
. Cp. xxxvii. ll. 9, 19,
Mir.
100, 415,
7739, &c.

6. So MS. The reading âbasseâ and the omission of âleverâ are mistakes
of the Roxb. ed.

22.
mesna sa leesce
, âhad his joyâ: âmenerâ (but more commonly
âdemenerâ) is used with words meaning joy, sorrow, &c., to indicate the
feeling or expression of it, e.g. xxxiii. l. 5.

XXI. 2.
comparisoun
: see note on i. l. 16.

6.

Mir.
119.

[Pg 466]

15.
veneisoun
, âchase,â hence âendeavour.â

18. Dr. Stengel rightly gives âTrestoutâ: nevertheless the MS. has
âTerstoutâ written in full.

20.
Honte et paour
, see note on xii. l. 8.

21.
Nâi.
This seems preferable to âNi,â being equivalent to âNe
iâ ânor thereâ (i = y), cp. xxxvii. l. 10. The proper word for ânorâ is
âne,â not âni.â

XXIII. 5.
lâ
for âle,â as indirect object, âto herâ: see
Glossary under le,
pron.

plevi
: so MS., as Dr. Stengel conjectures: cp.
Trait.

xvii. l. 2.

10.
danger
: see note on xii. l. 8.

13.
lui
, âher,â see Glossary.

15.
auns
: the MS. reading here might be âanns,â as given in
Roxb. ed., but it is quite clearly âaunâ in xxxii. l. 1.

XXIIII. 5.
autre, si le noun
: so MS. rightly. It means âanything
else except it,â i.e. his ladyâs name, ânounâ being the negative: cp.

Mir.
6495 f.,

âqu jammais parla

Parole, si tresfalse noun,â

and 8853,

âCertes, si de vo teste noun,

Nâad estÃ© dit dâaucune gent.â

XXV. 8. See note on ii. l. 23.

10. The MS. has âPortontâ and in l. 13 âsacheâ: Roxb. ed. âPartoutâ and
âsachez.â

11.
Du quoi
: so MS., Roxb. ed. âUn quoi,â which is nonsense.

18.
qâa

19.
Et dâautrepart
: Roxb. âEn dauterpart,â MS. Et
daut
re
part.

XXVI. 4. MS. âsil,â not âcil,â as given in Roxb. ed.

9. âIf a man gives himself, it is a proof,â &c. For the form of
expression, which is a favourite one with our author, cp.

15.
perfit
: cp.
Ded.
ii. 23.

26.
vo danger
: see note on xii. l. 8.

XXVII. 1. The first line is too long, but the mistake may be that of
the author. Similarly in
Mirour
3116, 14568, we have lines which
are each a foot too long for the metre. In all cases it would be easy
to correct: here, for example, by reading âMa dame, quant jeo vi vostre
oill riant.â

In xii. l. 22 we have, âDouls, vair, riant,â as a description of eyes.

3. Roxb. âPar un,â Dr. Stengel âPar mi,â MS. âP
ar
mi.â

5.
jeo me paie
, âI am content.â

24.
Parentre deus
, âbetween the two (alternatives)â: cp.

Mir.
1178.

XXIX. 19.
pourcella
, cp. xlii. l. 7, so âpourcela,â
Mir.

2349, &c.

[Pg 467]

XXX. 5.
Le Nief
: I suspect this is a mistake of the transcriber
for âLe vent.â It is not the ship that imperils his life but the storm,
and âLeâ for âLaâ is rather suspicious here.

8.
Uluxes
: the usual form of spelling in our authorâs works,
both French and English.

13. Cp. xviii. l. 9.

15.
Danger
: see note on xii. l. 8. Here the double meaning of
the word is played upon, danger in the ordinary sense and âdangerâ as
representing the forces opposed to the lover.

XXXII. This alone of the present series of balades has no envoy.

15. Roxb. ed. omits âse,â and accordingly Dr. Stengel turns âqaâ into
âque ia,â to restore the metre.

20.
retenue
, âservice,â referring to âservantâ just above.

XXXIII. 2.
a bone estreine
, a form of good wish, as âa mal
estreineâ (
Mir.
1435) is of malediction.

5. See note on xx. l. 22.

6.
guardoner
: so in MS., cp. xvii. l. 5.

10. See note on ii. l. 23.

XXXIIII. 6.
a covenir
, apparently âby agreement.â

11. The word omitted by the Roxb. ed. is âa.â

18.
De Alceone.
The hiatus must be admitted, as indicated by
the separation in the MS., cp.
Mir.
12228. We must not accent
âAlceoneâ on the final â-eâ as Dr. Stengel proposes, because of the way
the word is used in the
Confessio Amantis
, rhyming, for example,
with âone,â iv. 3058. âCeÃ¯xâ is a dissyllable here and in the English.

XXXV. 10.
en droit de
, âas regardsâ: see Glossary, âendroit.â

17.
en droit de mon atour
, âas regards my state.â

22.
falcoun
: the Roxb. ed. gives âfacon,â a false reading which
has hitherto entirely obscured the sense.

XXXVI. 3.
Papegai.
This seems to stand for any bright-plumaged
bird. It is not to be supposed that Gower had the definite idea of a
parrot connected with it.

6.
au tiel
: so MS., but Roxb. ed. âaut tiel,â whence Dr. Stengel
âau ttiel,â in pursuance, no doubt, of his theory of âVerdoppelung
anlautender Consonantenâ: see note on ii. l. 4.

au tiel assai
, âwith such trial,â i.e. âso sharply.â

10. Cp.
Mir.
8716.

15. For the opposition of the rose and the nettle cp. xxxvii. 24,

Mir.

XXXVII. 4.
la
: used (as well as âleâ) for indirect object fem.
See Glossary.

9. See note on xx. l. 2.

[Pg 468]

10.
entrÃ©e.
The termination â-Ã©eâ constitutes one syllable only
here, as at the end of the verse, where â-Ã©â and â-Ã©eâ rhyme freely
together: see, for example, the rhymes in xvii.

19.
me refiere
, ârefer myself,â i.e. âmake appeal.â The rhyme
requires correction of the reading ârefiers.â

XXXVIII. 1. Cp.
Mir.
12463 ff., where the âpiere dyamant
tresfineâ is said to disdain a setting of gold because drawn
irresistibly to iron. The loadstone and the diamond became identified
with one another because of the supposed hardness of both (âadamantâ).

XXXIX. 3. For this use of âet,â cp. xviii. 7.

9.
asseine
: rather a favourite word with our author in
various meanings, cp. x. l. 10, âjeo mon coer asseine,â âI direct
(the affections of) my heartâ; xiv. l. 17, âla fiertÃ© de son corage
asseine,â âstrike down the pride of her heartâ; and here, where âQui vo
persone ... asseineâ means âhe who addresses himself to your person.â

18.
pluis
: this form, which occurs also iv. l. 15, âDe pluis en
pluis,â seems to be only a variation of spelling, for it rhymes here
and elsewhere with -us, -uz: see Introduction, p. xxviii f.

XL. 7.
Ne puiss hoster
, &c. Cp. xvii. l. 27, âNe puis lesser
mais jeo lâamerayâ: âhosterâ means properly âtake away,â hence ârefrain
(myself).â

me pleigne
: so MS. The Roxb. ed. gives âma pleine.â

11.
serretz.
The future tense (if it be future) need give us no
anxiety, in view of the looseness about tenses which is habitual with
our author: cp. xliv. l. 6,
Mir.
416. In any case âserietz,â
which Dr. Stengel substitutes, is not a correct form.

22.
chaunÃ§on
: MS. chaÌ
nÌ
con.

XLI. Here the address is from the lady to her lover, and so it is also
in the three succeeding balades and in xlvi. Notice that the second
person singular is used in xli.-xliii. where the language is that of
hostile contempt.

9.
sent
, for âcentâ: so âSiâ for âCiâ in the Title of the

Balades
, and âSilâ in xlii. l. 20, &c. The converse change of
âsâ to âcâ is not uncommon, see
Mir.
799.

17.
qâensi ment

âqensimentâ is quite without justification.

19. The romance of Generides exists in an English version, which has
been edited by Dr. Aldis Wright from a manuscript in the library of
Trinity Coll. Camb. (E.E.T.S. 1873).

Florent
, no doubt, is the same as the hero of Gowerâs story in

Conf. Am.
i. 1407 ff., though there are others of his name in
Romance.

PartonopÃ©
is Partonopeus de Blois. The correction of âpar

XLIIII. Here the lady addresses a true lover, whose suit she accepts.

, âyour dispositionâ: see Glossary.

XLVI. The lady speaks again.

5.
sauf toutdis
, âsaving alwaysâ: cp. xxii. l. 26, âSalvant
toutdis lâestat de vostre honour.â

15. See note on ii. l. 23.

18.
par envoisure

, âsurpass all others at the trial.â

24.

9.
le repos.

<LI>. This balade is not numbered and does not form one of the
âCinkante Baladesâ of which the title speaks. It is a kind of
devotional conclusion to the series. The envoy which follows, âO
gentile Engleterre,â does not belong to this balade, being divided from
it by a space in the MS. and having a different system of rhymes. It is
in fact the envoy of the whole book of balades.

: see Glossary under âesperer.â

TRAITIÃ

The title âTraitiÃ©â is not in the MSS., but is inserted as that to
which reference is made in the Glossary and elsewhere. What follows,
âPuisquâil ad dit,â &c., is the heading found in those MSS. which give
this series of balades together with the
Confessio Amantis
, that
is in seven out of ten copies. In the other three the
TraitiÃ©

occurs independently, but in two of these, viz. the All Souls and the
Trentham MSS., it is imperfect at the beginning, so that we cannot
say what heading it had, while in the third, the Glasgow copy, it has
that which is given in the critical note. It is certain in any case
that the author did not regard it as inseparable from the
Confessio
Amantis
.

I. The numbers are introduced for reference: there are none in the MSS.

4.
per
: so in the Fairfax MS. fully written, but we have âparâ
fully written elsewhere, as xi. l. 16, therefore the contractions are
usually so expanded, e.g. in the preceding line.

8.
celle alme
, âthe soul,â cp.
Bal.
iii. l. 1, and see
note on
Mir.
301.

9.
Tant soulement
, see Glossary, âtansoulement.â

II. 5. See note on
Bal.
ii. l. 23. For the substance of the
passage cp.
Mir.
17935 ff.

7. He means that continence is better than marriage, as we see from the
margin of the next balade.

20.
en son atour
, âin its own condition.â

III. 1.
parfit
: this form is preferred as expansion of the MS.
contraction, because it is more usual and is found fully written both
in the
Mirour
(e.g. 1640) and in the present work, xviii. l.
28 (Trentham MS.), but âperfitâ occurs in
Ded.
i. l. 23 and

Bal.
xxvi. l. 15.

20.

, cp.
Bal.
viii. l. 17.

IV. 5.
resemblont amorouses
: cp.
Mir.
1094.

17.
par tiele empeinte
: cp.
Bal.
xlii. l. 10. It seems to
mean âin such a manner.â

V. 8.
lâespousailes
, for âli espousailes,â but this use of âliâ
as fem. plur. is rather irregular.

[Pg 471]

VI. For the story see
Conf. Am.
vi. 1789 ff.

The Latin margin has lost some parts of words in the Trentham MS. by
close cutting of the edges. The Roxb. ed. does not indicate the nature
of this loss nor correctly represent its extent, so that we are left
to suppose, for example, that ânuperâ is omitted, when as a fact it
is there, but partly cut away, and that the MS. reads âviolantâ for
âviolantes.â

6.
envoisure
, âtrickery,â âdeceit,â cp. xvi. l. 3.

10.
sanz nulle autre essoine
, âwithout any other cause.â

15. The margin has suffered here also in the Trentham MS., but not
exactly as represented in the Roxb. ed.

17.
Circes
: cp.
Mir.
16674 f., where the same form is
used,

âUluxes, qant il folparla

A Circes et a Calipsa.â

VII. Margin damaged in the Trentham MS., as above mentioned. For the
story cp.
Conf. Am.
ii. 2145 ff. and iv. 2045 ff.

1.
El grant desert
, &c. Cp. Chaucer,
Monkes Tale
, l. 128.

5.
Achelons
: so in
Conf. Am.
iv. 2068. Chaucer has
âAchiloyns,â wrongly given âAchiloyusâ in some editions.

9.
Eolen
: this is the form of the name used in the
Conf.
Am.
v. 6808 ff.

11.
dâEurice
: âEuricieâ in the Latin margin; cp. âThe kinges
dowhter of Eurice,â
Conf. Am.
ii. 2267. It is taken as the name
of a country, but no doubt this results from a misunderstanding of some
such expression as Ovidâs âEurytidosque Ioles,â âof Iole the daughter
of Eurytus,â taken to mean âEurytian Iole.â

Herculem
: cp. âMedeamâ in viii. l. 12.

18.
enbastiront tout le plai
, âcontrived the whole matter.â
The word âplaitâ or âpleeâ means properly a process at law, hence a
process or design of any kind: âbastir un plaitâ is the same thing as
âfaire un plait,â used of designing or proposing a thing. See Burguy,

Gram.
ii. under âplaitâ in the Glossary.

XI. Cp.
Conf. Am.
i. 2459 ff.

3.

XII. Cp.
Conf. Am.
v. 5551 ff.

19.
hupe
: the
Conf. Am.
v. 6041 says, âA lappewincke
mad he was.â The two birds might easily be confused because both are
marked by
[Pg 472]
the crest which in this case (according to the
Confessio
Amantis
) determined the transformation. A similar confusion appears
in
Mirour
8869, where the bird that misleads people as to the
place of its nest is no doubt meant for a lapwing.

XIII. 10. This punctuation is more in the manner of the author and also
gives a better balance to the sentence than if we made the pause after
âavoirâ: so âdu roi maisâ in the next line: see note on
Bal.
xx.

power to keep his body from falling into the pains of love.â

13.
a lâomicide esguarde
, âlooks towards murder.â

XV. 1-10. The losses at the beginnings of these lines in the Fairfax
MS. are as follows: Comun | De Lan | Enqore ma | Pour essamp | Cil
qâest gu | Droitz est | Car be | To | U que | Deu |

7.
Car beal oisel
, &c., cp.

âplevie au destre mainâ cp.
Bal.
xxiii. l. 5.

9.
ert
, âthere shall be,â cp.
Mir.
17689. Both future and
conditional are used to express command or obligation.

13. This is the traditional character of Gawain âthe Courteousâ:

ââArt thou not he whom men call light-of-love?â

âAy,â said Gawain, âfor women be so light.ââ

Tennyson,
Pelleas and Ettarre
;

XVIII. 22. This Envoy, though it may be taken to have reference to the
whole series of balades composing the
TraitiÃ©
, belongs in form
to the concluding balade and speaks of it specially, âceste Balade
envoie.â It is addressed to the world generally, âAl universitÃ© de tout
le monde,â and, as was the wont of Englishmen who wrote in French, the
author asks pardon for his deficiencies of language.

The Latin lines âQuis sit vel qualisâ follow the
TraitiÃ©
, so far
as I know, in every existing copy, and must be taken in connexion with
it. In all except one of the MSS. these first nine lines are followed,
as in the text given, by the short
Carmen de variis in amore
passionibus
beginning âEst amor in glosa,â and this is followed by
the eight lines beginning âLex docet auctorum.â In the Trentham copy,
however, the intervening
Carmen
is omitted and these last eight
lines are given as if they formed one piece with the first nine.

[Pg 473]

âQuis sit vel qualis,â &c.

2.
mentalis sit amor
, &c. I take this to mean, âso that there
may be such spiritual love (as I have described) in the orderâ; but
it is not very clear, and it must be noted that F punctuates after
âmentalis.â

3 f. âWe may fear what is to come by the example of what is past;
to-morrow as yesterday the flesh may be lightly stirred.â

Carmen de variis, &c.

With this compare
Bal.
xlviii., and
Rom. de la Rose
, 4320
ff.,

âAmors ce est pais haÃ¯neuse,

Amors est haÃ¯ne amoreuse,â &c.

1.
in glosa
, âby interpretation.â

âLex docet auctorum,â &c.

1.
quod iter
, &c., âthat the fleshly pilgrimage is more secure
for those who have the bands of wedlock upon them.â

5.
quasi regula
: apparently comparing marriage to a monastic
rule, into which men are gathered for their salvation.

7.
Hinc vetus annorum.
The comment on this concluding couplet is
to be found in the record of the poetâs marriage, in the year 1397-8,
to Agnes Groundolf.

[Pg 475]

GLOSSARY

AND

INDEX OF PROPER NAMES

Note
. This Glossary is intended to be a complete Vocabulary
of the language used by Gower in his French works, recording as far
as possible every word and every form of spelling, with a sufficient
number of references to serve for verification. The meanings in English
are given only where this seems desirable, either for explanation of
the less usual words or to distinguish the various uses of those that
are more familiar. It must be remembered that some of the meanings
given are conjectural, and the unqualified statements of the Glossary
are sometimes discussed in the Notes.

With regard to the references, it should be noted that the number
of them is not at all an indication of the frequency with which a
word occurs. Many of the commonest words, occurring in one form of
spelling only and presenting no difficulty, are dismissed with a single
reference to the first passage where they occur in each section of the
authorâs works. On the other hand words which are found with different
forms of spelling usually have references given for each form, and
often the fact that a word is of uncommon occurrence or presents
some difficulty as regards meaning has caused it to be followed by
a larger number of references. It should be observed that for the
purposes of the Glossary our authorâs French works have been regarded
as falling into two distinct sections, the first consisting of the

Mirour de lâOmme
, and the second of the
Balades
and the

TraitiÃ©
, and wherever a word or form occurs in both sections
the double reference is given. This is done in order to exhibit the
likeness or difference of the language used, and to serve as additional
evidence of the authorship of the
Mirour
. For Proper Names a
complete set of references is regularly given, but allegorical names
and personified vices and virtues are not usually classed as Proper
Names.

The references to a number only are to lines in the
Mirour de
lâOmme
. The letters D, B, and T, followed by a Roman and an Arabic
numeral, refer to the balades in the
Dedication
, the
Cinkante
Balades
, and the
TraitiÃ©
respectively. These are not
referred to in the Glossary by lines but only by stanzas. The Table of
[Pg 476]

Contents at the beginning of the
Mirour
is referred to by the
letter C. Such a reference as 16272 (R) is to the rubric following l.
16272.

Where difference of spelling consists in the insertion or omission of
a single letter, the fact is often recorded by means of parenthesis,
e.g. âcon(n)estable,â âbaro(u)n,â indicating that both âconnestableâ
and âconestable,â âbarounâ and âbaron,â are found. The inflexional

s
or
z
in the termination of singular nouns is usually
treated in the same way, but references are not always given for
both forms. The gender of substantives is not noted, because so much
irregularity prevails in this respect that it seems hardly worth while
to investigate the subject. All verbal inflexions of any interest have
been set down. The grammatical abbreviations,
s.
substantive,

a.
adjective,
v.a.
verb active,
v.n.
verb
neuter, 1
s.p.
first person sing. pres. tense,
pp.
past
participle, and so on, will be readily understood. Words which occur in
the text with an initial mute
h
dropped owing to elision will
usually be found under the letter
h
.

FOOTNOTES:

[A]
I prefer the term âAnglo-Normanâ to âAnglo-French,â
partly because it is the established and well-understood name for
the language in question, and partly for the reasons given in Paulâs

Grundriss der germ. Philologie
, vol. i. p. 807. It must however
be remembered that the term indicates not a dialect popularly spoken
and with a true organic development, but a courtly and literary form of
speech, confined to the more educated class of Society, and therefore
especially liable to be influenced by continental French and to receive
an influx of learned words taken directly from Latin. The name implies
that in spite of such influences it retained to a great extent its
individuality, and that its development was generally on the lines of
the Norman speech from which it arose.

[B]
The references to the
Balades
and
TraitiÃ©

are by stanza, unless otherwise indicated.

[C]
But the same word in other connexions is a monosyllable,
as
qâils lÃ©es en soiont
28132, and rhymes with
magestÃ©
,

degrÃ©
, &c., 27575, 28093, 28199.

[D]
We have in

and so too

JudeÃ«

GalileÃ«

GalilÃ©e
in rhyme with

28387.

[E]
Cp.
Romania
, xii. 194. I am much indebted to M.
Paul Meyerâs notes on the
Vie de S. GrÃ©goire
, as well as to his
other writings.

[F]
See Sturmfels in
Anglia
, viii. 220, and Behrens,

Franz. Studien
, v. 84. I take this opportunity of saying
that I am indebted both to the formerâs
Altfranz. Vokalismus im
Mittelenglischen
and to the latterâs
BeitrÃ¤ge zur Geschichte der
franzÃ¶sischen Sprache in England
.

[G]
Those who quote

Gower, e.g. Sturmfels, in

[I]
A list of poems in which this stanza is used is given in

Romania
, ix. 231, by M. Gaston Raynaud.

[J]
Under this head I do not include the termination
(
-ont
or
-ent
) of the 3 pers. pl. pres. tense, which was
apparently to some extent accented, see ll. 1265, 1803, 1820, &c., and
in one stanza even bears the rhyme (20294 ff.).

[K]
Perhaps, however,
dame
was in these cases really a
monosyllable, as apparently in
Mir.
6733, 13514, 16579.

[L]
It must not be assumed however that the text of the
Roxburghe Club edition accurately represents that of the MS. If such
variations as autre (
for
lautre), ii. l. 21, En qui iv. 17, De
vii. 6, Nest pas vii. 13, xiv. 7, &c., prendre x. 20, et uns xv. 15,
El fait xvi. 18, and so on, are unnoticed in this edition, that is not
owing to the negligence of the present editor, but because they are not
in fact readings of the MS.

[M]
For example B gives us the following variations in the
first two balades:

Trait.
i. l. 4 gouernance  6 discret  13 bon  20 et (
for
a)
ii. l. 1.   la spirit    qui ert   2 Est   4 Qui ert
om.
dont
5 de (
for
le)    7 bone.

There are more bad mistakes here in two balades than in the whole text
of the
TraitiÃ©
as given by any one of the four best MSS. On the
other hand, âcreatorisâ in the heading of the first balade, and âhommeâ
(for âlom
m
eâ) in ii. 11, are mistakes of the German editor.

[N]
MS. Camb. Univ. Add. 3035

[O]

Owing to the loss of a part of the leaf
(f.12)

on which the Latin occurs, the text of
ll. 9-12
and of the
first prose quotation which follows is imperfect. It runs thus:

.  .  .  .  . pullus quo nunquam gracior vllus

.  .  .  . regit que tirannica colla subegit

.  .  . ile cepit oleum quo regna recepit

.  .  . ri iuncta stipiti noua stirps redit vncta.

.  . il proficiet inimicus in eo et filius iniqui

.  .  . non apponet nocere ei.

The missing words are supplied from other copies of the same lines,
which are found in a somewhat different arrangement in the All Soulsâ
and Glasgow MSS. of the âVox Clamantisâ (the prose quotations in the
latter only).

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN GOWER, VOLUME 1 ***

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
at
www.gutenberg.org
. If you
are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

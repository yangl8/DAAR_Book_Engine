PURPOSE

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that
colour is a determinable property of matter,
and to make generally known methods of colour
analysis and synthesis which have proved of great
practical value in establishing standards of purity
in some industries.

The purpose is also to show that the methods are
thoroughly scientific in theory and practice, and
that the results are not likely to be changed by
further discoveries. Also that out of the work done
a new law has been developed, which the writer calls
the Law of Specific Colour Development, meaning
that every substance has its own rate of colour
development for regularly increasing thicknesses.

THE THEORY.

Of the six colours in white light—red, orange,
yellow, green, blue and violet; Red, Yellow and
Blue are regarded as dominants, because they visually
hold the associated colours orange, green and violet
in subjection.

An equivalent unit of pure red, pure yellow and
pure blue is adopted, and incorporated into glass.
The unit is multiplied to obtain greater intensities,
and divided to obtain lesser intensities.

[x]

The coloured glasses are called absorbents. The
red absorbent transmits violet, red and orange, but
the red ray alone is visible as colour, until the other
absorbents are superimposed, and the character of
the group of rays changed. In the same way yellow
transmits orange and green, and blue transmits
green and violet, whilst the yellow and blue alone
are visible as colour. Orange, green and violet
are here called subordinates, which may be developed
as follows:—

Or. = R. + Y.   Gr. = Y. + B.    Vi. = B. + R.

Twenty-five yearsâ experience in the application
of the theory and the method to the requirements
of practical work, have given no reason for change.

International Juries and Scientific Societies, also a

giving entire satisfaction.

THE METHOD.

The colour composition of any object may be
measured by superimposing units of different colours
until the colour of the object is matched. A convenient
apparatus is furnished for this purpose. The
composition of the colour is learned by merely reading
the markings on the glasses.

It is of course necessary that in the isolation of
colour rays, some unit for measuring the intensity
of both light and colour be established. As will
be explained later, all such units are necessarily
arbitrary. In this method the unit has been established
by taking the smallest amount of colour easily
perceptible to the ordinary vision. This unit or
âoneâ is divided into tenths in the darker shades,
and hundredths in the lighter scale. One one-hundredth
is the smallest amount of colour measurable
by a normal trained vision.

When equivalent units in the three colours are
superimposed, their equivalent value (not their aggregate
value) represents so much white light absorbed.
For instance, 2 R. + 2 Y. + 2 B. absorbs two units
of white light.

When the absorptive power of the colour standards
is less than the intensity of the light, associated white
light remains.

Light and Colour Theories

CHAPTER I.

Introduction.

It may at first appear strange that colour, one
of the most important indices of value in the
Arts, Manufactures, and Natural Products, should
have no common nomenclature or reliable standard
for reference, the reproduction of a given colour
depending for exactitude on the memory of a sensation;
whereas this branch of science requires a
physical means of recording a colour, with a power
of recovery. It remains to be shown that this
power of record and recovery is possible, and depends
only on the observance of a few simple natural laws
easy of application.

The study of colour is carried on by two principal
methods: the spectroscopic, where the colours are
partially separated as a continuous band by a regular
variation in their indices of refraction, the colours
gradually merging into each other by overlapping
in opposite directions; or by absorption, where a
colour is developed by absorbing its complementary,
and is isolated as a single or complex colour. This
latter is natureâs own method.

It is necessary to touch on some theoretical differences
which exist between Scientists and Artists,
as to which are Primary colours, as confusion of this
[2]

character retards investigation. Scientists adopt
Red, Green, and Violet as Primaries, regarding all
other colours as mixtures of these; whilst Artists
and Colourists adopt Red, Yellow and Blue as the
Primaries, and all other colours as made from them.

The theory of the Scientists is based on the phenomena
developed by mixing coloured lights taken
from different parts of the spectrum. This is a
method of synthesis, each added colour being a
progressive stage towards the complexity of white
light. In this case the colour developed is that of
the preponderating ray of a complex beam. The
theory of the Artists is based on the phenomena
developed by mixed pigments. This is a method
of analysis, tending towards ray simplicity, each
added pigment reducing the complexity of the
colour developed by its power of selective absorption.

The theoretical differences between the two schools
appear to have arisen from supposing that a given
colour developed by the two methods should correspond;
but considering the differences in their ray
composition, this would be impossible, for although
both may be describable by one general colour term,
as for instance a Red, they would be of two varieties.
It remains to be shown that one theory may
cover both sets of phenomena.

The Red, Green, and Violet theory appears to be
based on two principal assumptions: first that
there are only three fundamental colours; and
second that the rays taken from different colour
areas are pure colours. Both assumptions are open
to question. In regard to the first, there is no difficulty
in isolating six colours; and as to the second,
[3]

it can be demonstrated that the colours do overlap
in every part, with a double overlapping in the
middle colours, and are therefore not simple but
complex.

PAST THEORIES.

In a work of this nature it is unnecessary to
deal minutely with the theories which have been
adopted from time to time since Newtonâs discovery
of the continuous spectrum. It will, however, be
useful to touch on the principal points where theorists
are agreed, and also on some of their points of
difference, the latter in order to find, if possible, the
causes of their difference.

Note to Plate I.

The respective positions of the primaries of each theory in
regard to the whole cycle of distinguishable colours are illustrated
above, and the primaries of each theory are shown in
their several spectrum positions, the spectrum being shown as
bent in circular form.

The six principal theories of primary colours are
[4]

given in Table I, and illustrated on Plate I, with
the names of the primaries of each theory opposite
the names of some of their principal advocates.
It should not be forgotten when comparing these
wide divergences, that each theory has been the
result of experimental evidence, in what was, at the
time, and remains up to the present, a new and
progressive branch of science.

They agree that the spectrum colours are purer
than the pigmentary colours, and that by reason
of their being referable to wave length positions,
they are most adaptable as standards of colour.
There has also been common agreement that certain
colours are primaries, and that all other colours are
mixtures of these, but there has been wide divergence
as to their number and even the colours
themselves.

CHAPTER II.

Evolution of the Method.

The writer was formerly a brewer, and this
work had its origin in an observation that
the finest flavour in beer was always associated with
a colour technically called âgolden amber,â and
that, as the flavour deteriorated, so the colour
assumed a reddish hue. It was these variations in
tint that suggested the idea of colour standards
as a reliable means of reference.

The first experiments were made with coloured
liquids in test tubes of equal diameter, and by these
means some useful information was obtained; but
as the liquids soon changed colour, frequent renewals
were necessary, and there was always a difficulty
and uncertainty in their exact reproduction.

To obviate this, glass in different colours was
tried, and long rectangular wedges with regularly
graded tapers were ground and polished for standards,
whilst correspondingly tapered glass vessels
were made for the beers. These were arranged to
work side by side, and perpendicularly, before two
apertures of an optical instrument, which gave a
simultaneous view of both. The apertures were
provided with a fixed centre line, to facilitate the
reading off of comparisons of thickness. There
[6]

was no difficulty in obtaining glass which approximated
to the required colour when used in one thickness
only. But as thickness varied, the test no
longer held good for both standards, their rates of
colour change being different, making the method
unreliable.
[1]

The system about to be described is one of analytical
absorption, and has been published from time
to time in the form of papers, read before Societies
interested in the question of colour standardization;
as also in two descriptive works by the present
writer. The earlier works were necessarily fragmentary,
but gathered system as the subject progressed.

At an early stage in the investigations it was
realized that the handbooks of the period dealt
largely with theoretical differences which were of
little service to the technical worker. Under these
circumstances the writer applied for advice to the
late Mr. Browning of the Strand, who gave it as
his opinion that no work existed which could be of
service to the writer. All that could be done was
to go on until something should be arrived at. On
this, all theoretical reading was put aside, and the
work proceeded on the simple lines of observing,
recording, and classifying experimental facts.

In working with glass of different colours it was
found that some combinations developed colour,
whilst other combinations destroyed it. This suggested
[7]

the probability of a governing natural law;
and experimental work was undertaken in the hope
of discovering it. The result was the construction
of a mechanical scale of colour standards, which
are now in use in over one thousand laboratories,
and no question of their practical accuracy arises.
The principal conditions for ensuring accuracy
and constancy of results are embodied in the following
code of nine precautions, which have been
published for nearly twenty years without being
disputed. They may therefore be considered as
governing laws, at least for the present. The colour
theory adopted for these Governing Laws has
grown out of a series of experimental facts capable
of demonstration, and is summed up in the following
code of nine Laws.

Laws 1, 2, and 3 relate to White and Coloured
Light, and are as follows:—

1. Normal white light is made up of the six colour
rays, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Violet
in equal proportions. When these rays are in unequal
proportions the light is abnormal and coloured.

2. The particular colour of an abnormal beam
is that of the one preponderating ray, if the colour
be simple, or of the two preponderating rays if the
colour be complex. The depth of colour is in proportion
to the preponderance.

3. The rays of a direct light are in a different
condition to the same rays after diffusion, and give
rise to a different set of colour phenomena.

Laws 4, 5, 6, and 7 deal with The Limitations of
the Vision to appreciate Colour.

4. The vision is not simultaneously sensitive
[8]

to more than two colours in the same beam of light.
The colour of any other abnormal ray is merged
in the luminosity of the beam.

5. The two colours to which the vision is simultaneously
sensitive are always adjacent in their
spectrum order, Red and Violet being considered
adjacent for this purpose.

6. The vision is unable to appreciate colour in an
abnormal beam outside certain limits, from two
causes:

(
a
) The colour of an abnormal beam may be
masked to the vision from excess of luminosity.

(
b
) The luminous intensity of the abnormal beam
may be too low to excite definite colour sensations.

7. The vision has a varying rate of appreciation
for different colours by time, the lowest being for red.
The rate increases in rapidity through the spectrum,
until the maximum rate is reached with violet.
And since this varying rate necessitates a time
limit for critical observations, five seconds has been
adopted as the limit, no variations being perceptible
in that time.

Laws 8 and 9 relate to Colour Constants.

8. The colour of a given substance of a given
thickness is constant so long as the substance itself,
and the conditions of observation, remain unaltered.

9. Every definite substance has its own specific
rate of colour development for regularly increasing
thicknesses.

[9]

CHAPTER III.

Evolution of the Unit.

The dimensions of the light and colour unit
here adopted, together with the scales of
division, were in the first instance physiological,
depending entirely on the skill of normal visions
for exactitude. The co-relation of equal values
in the different colour scales, was secured by an
elaborate system of cross-checking, rendered necessary
because the establishment of a perfectly colourless
neutral tint unit, demanded an exact balance
in values of the different colour scales. These
scales have stood the test of many yearsâ work by
many observers, and in no case has any alteration
been required. The original set is still in use.

The first point which required consideration
after the want of standard colour scales was realized,
was the basis and dimensions of the unit.
So far as the writer knew there was no published
information bearing on this which could be used
as a guide.

Several arbitrary scales for specific purposes had
already been constructed by selecting a colour depth
which could easily be distinguished, calling it a
unit, and scaling it by duplicating and subdividing.
This course was adopted with a coloured glass
[10]

which approximately matched Ales and Malt solutions,
and another which matched Nesslerized Ammonia
solutions. No insuperable difficulty occurred
in constructing scales available for quantitative
work in these two instances.

The intensity of the colour unit for these arbitrary
scales, was that which appeared to be most
convenient for the purpose required, but the several
scales had no common basis. The unit was physiological,
and the exactitude of the scales depended
entirely on the skill of the vision for discriminating
small differences.

As the writerâs experimental work progressed, it
became evident that red, yellow, and blue were
the only colours suitable for systematic work. The
superimposition of any two, developed a third colour
which apparently had no relation to either. The
superimposition of the third glass modified or
destroyed all colour and reduced the amount of
light. This suggested the idea that if the three
colours could be so balanced that the light transmitted
was colourless, it would be evidence of
equivalence of intensity in the individual colours.

The real difficulty was in obtaining this equivalence,
because a balance which transmitted a neutral
tint by one light developed colour by another.
This necessitated the selection of a standard light.
The light finally selected was that of a so-called
sea fog, away from the contaminating influence of
towns. The white fog of Salisbury Plain was used
as being most available. It required two yearsâ
work to establish equivalence in the unit.

CHAPTER IV.

Derivation of Colour from White Light.

The method of analysing white light into its
colour constituents by means of coloured
glass absorbents of known intensity and purity, is
illustrated by the set of nine circles in Plate II,
which demonstrate that colour is developed by the
absorption of the complementary colour rays. The
ratios of transmission are equal.

In this set of illustrations the circles represent
light of 20 units luminous intensity, and the absorptive
value of the three glass colours is each of 20
units, therefore the whole of the light and colour
energies are presumed to be dealt with.

In the first set of three circles,
A
represents a
beam of normal white light.
B
a similar beam as
divided into the six colour rays, Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue and Violet in equal proportions,
C
as
wholly absorbed by Red, Yellow, and Blue glasses,
each of 20 units colour intensity.

Figures
1
,
2
and
3
represent the specific action
of Red, Yellow, and Blue glass on the white light.

Red
absorbs Yellow, Green and Blue, transmitting
Violet, Red and Orange, developing Red only.

Yellow
absorbs Blue, Violet, and Red, transmitting
Orange, Yellow and Green, developing Yellow only.

[12]

Blue
absorbs Red, Orange and Yellow, transmitting
Green, Blue, and Violet, developing Blue only.

By this method of development, Red, Yellow or
Blue, when seen alone are visually monochromatic,
although composite in structure, each containing
a group of three rays, the middle ray alone exciting
the colour sensation.

Circles 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the development of
Orange, Green and Violet from the triad groups, by
intercepting the light with two glass colours.

Circle 4, Red on Yellow, develops Orange by
absorbing Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet and Red.

Circle 5, Yellow on Blue, develops Green by
absorbing Blue, Violet, Red, Orange and Yellow.

Circle 6, Blue on Red, develops Violet by absorbing
Red, Orange, Yellow, Green and Blue.

By this method of demonstration the six colours
fall naturally into two groups. The first group includes
Red, Yellow, and Blue, whilst the second
group includes Orange, Green, and Violet. The
colours of the second group, Orange, Green, and
Violet, are true monochromes, each being isolated
from the light, by the absorption of the five other
rays.

These illustrations deal with light and colour
of 20 units intensity;
[2]

as the intensity of the light
here is exactly equal to the absorptive power of
the standards, no free light remains; where the
absorptive power of the colour standards is less
than the light, associated white light remains; for
[13]

instance, if only one unit of colour was developed,
19 units associated white light would remain.

PLATE III

To face page 13.

[
Lovibond, Colour Theories.

This method of colour development by analytical
absorption is further illustrated by Plate III, showing
the effect of superimposition of the three colours in
their several combinations as intercepting a beam
of white light.

Not all lights which appear white to the vision
are truly normal white; colour may be masked by
excess of luminosity, and only become evident when
the luminosity has been reduced, by placing neutral
tint standards between the light and the observer.
Direct sunlight, and some artificial lights, are instances.
(Law 6 (
a
) page 8.)

On the other hand, an abnormal light may be
too low for the vision to discriminate colour. This
may be observed in nature by the gradual loss of
colour in flowers, etc., in the waning intensities of
evening light. The order of their disappearance
is shown in Chart I.

[14]

CHAPTER V.

Standard White Light.

The colour of a substance is determined by the
ray composition of the light it reflects, or
transmits to the vision, the colour would therefore
vary with every change in the ray proportions
of the incident light; it follows that constancy
in colour measurement can only be obtained by a
colourless light. Up to the present diffused daylight
is the only light which complies with the condition
of ray equality.

The absolute equality of the six spectrum colours
may be difficult to establish in any light, and their
constancy in equivalence under varying light intensities
may be open to argument. But, as everyday
work is carried on mainly under daylight conditions,
and as the vision is the final arbiter for colour
work, theoretical questions outside the discriminating
power of the vision, need be no bar to the establishment
of a working standard white light; and in
saying that diffused daylight is normal white, it is
only intended to mean: In so far as a normal vision
can determine.

Apart from any theoretical explanation it is an
experimental fact, that the abnormal rays of direct
[15]

sunlight, and some artificial lights, may be so modified
by diffusion as to be available for a limited
range of colour work. In the case of diffused north
sunlight, when taken from opposite the sunâs
meridian, the modification is sufficient to make it
available as a standard white light. In the case of
artificial lights, their use is, as yet, limited to visual
matching (not recording) and arbitrary comparisons.

THE BLACK UNIT.

Ideal black is total absence of light, and can
only be realized as a sensation, in the presence of
light, which may however be in contrast or in
association.

The nearest approach to ideal black by contrast,
is to view a hole in a box with a blackened interior,
so arranged that no light entering the hole, can be
reflected back to the vision: in this way associated
light, if not entirely absent, is reduced to a minimum
and total darkness is practically realized by the
vision in contrast with the surrounding light.

Pigmentary black viewed under diffused daylight
conditions is always associated with white
light, as no substance, however black it may be,
absorbs all the impinging light; as examples, the
following measurements of three white and three
black pigments were made at an angle of 45 degrees
with a light intensity of 25 units.

This is a true quantitative analysis of the 25 units
of white light after reflection from the black pigments.
The black units represent the proportion
of white light absorbed, whilst the beams reflected
[16]

from the pigments consist of the colour values
developed which are associated with the unabsorbed
white light.

The analyses demonstrate that black is not itself
an active energy analogous to colour, but is a minus
quantity distinguishable by contrast with the
original light. The reflected beam consists of the
colour developed, associated with the residue of
unaltered light.

Note.
—Suitable proportions of Violet and Blue
give character and value to black, whilst Orange
and Yellow are less pleasing as tending to rustiness.

CHAPTER VI.

Qualitative Colour Nomenclature.

SIMPLE COLOURS.

The vision can separate six monochromatic
colours from a beam of white light, therefore
in practical work six must be dealt with, no
matter how they may be theoretically accounted
for. They naturally take the accepted spectrum
names and symbols already in use. To these are
added two other terms, Bk. to signify black, and L.
for light; these terms deal with the brightness, or
dinginess, of a colour.

COMPLEX COLOURS.

The order of the association of simple colours to
form complex, is governed by two factors. The
[18]

first is a physiological limitation of the vision, which
is unable to simultaneously distinguish more than
two colours, in the same beam of light, this limits
the most complex colour to two colour names. The
second limitation is one of association, based on the
experimental fact, that the particular two must be
adjacent in their spectrum order, spectrum red and
violet being considered adjacent for this purpose.
Under these conditions, any given colour must be
either a monochrome, or a bichrome, and all complex
colours must be bichromes. Therefore the
only possible combinations are as follows:—

Red  and  Orange

Orange and  Yellow

Yellow and  Blue

Blue and Green

Green and Violet

Violet and  Red

describing the components of the whole range of
distinguishable colours is set out in the following

from a point of white light, and the formation
of binary sensations by the combination of
adjacent colours, is graphically illustrated in
the above diagram.

In order to make the qualitative symbols quantitative
it is only necessary to add the numerical
unit value to each factor as found by direct experiment.

CHAPTER VII.

Quantitative Colour Nomenclature.

THE GLASS STANDARD SCALES.

At an early stage of the investigation, it was
found that coloured glass gave better results
than coloured solutions, and that Red, Yellow, and
Blue, were the only colours suitable for systematic
work; it was also found that any colour could be
produced by their combination. As already described
arbitrary scales were first used in many
colours, but were superseded by these three, which,
when graded into scales of equivalent value, were
found to cover all daylight colours.

Upon this evidence, scales of red, yellow and
blue were constructed of glass slips, each scale
being all of one colour, with a regular variation of
intensity from 0Â·01 to 20Â·0 units, equal units of the
three scales being in equivalence with each other.
The dimensions of the unit are necessarily arbitrary,
but the scales comply with the essentials of a scientific
standard, in that the divisions are equal, and
the unit recoverable. The equality of the unit
divisions in the scales, is demonstrated by a system
of cross-checking. The test of colour equivalence
has already been described on pages 10 and 28.

[21]

The power of recovering the unit, is by co-relation
to well-known physical colour constants, such as
is easily obtained by definite intensities of percentage
solutions, of selected pure chemical compounds
in distilled water, at standard temperatures. For
example, a one per cent. solution of pure crystallized
copper sulphate C
2
SO

5H
2
O at 60Â° F. when viewed
in the optical instrument in a 1-inch stratum,
must be matched by a combination of Yellow 1Â·58
and Blue 1Â·55.

The inch of distilled water itself constitutes very
little of this colour; the colour of distilled water
is remarkably uniform, and might almost be taken
as a colour constant, thus: A 2-foot stratum is
matched by Yellow 0Â·1 and Blue 0Â·34, a 4-foot
stratum by Yellow 1Â·0 and Blue 1Â·45.

A one per cent. solution of
Nickel Sulphate
NiSO

O, tem.
60Â° F. in a 2-inch stratum must be
matched by 2Â·2 Blue and 2Â·0 Yellow units.

A one per cent. solution of
Potassium Bichromate

Cr

O, Tem. 60Â° and in a 2-inch stratum after being
dulled by 0Â·5 neutral tint units must be matched
by 34Â·0 yellow and 9Â·6 red units.

METHOD OF DEVELOPING, MEASURING AND NAMING
COLOUR.

The single sensation colours, Red, Yellow and
Blue, are matchable by a single glass from the corresponding
colour scale; the depth of colour is directly
indicated by the value of the glass used.

The single sensation colours, Orange, Green and
Violet, are matchable by a combination of equal
units, from two of the standard scales, the depth
[22]

of colour is directly indicated by the unit value
of either of the glasses, thus: 2Â·0 Blue + 2Â·0 Red
develop 2Â·0 units Violet.

A given neutral grey is matchable by a combination
of equal units from the three standard scales,
the depth of grey, is directly indicated by the unit
value on either of the glasses used, thus:—

3Â·0 Red + 3Â·0 yellow + 3Â·0 blue develop 3Â·0 units
neutral tint.

The complex colour sensations, red and yellow
oranges, yellow and blue greens, blue and red violets
are matchable by unequal glasses from two of the
standard scales; the colour developed is not directly
indicated by the unit value of the glasses, but is
recorded by means of an equation, the first half of
which contains the separate values of the glasses
used, and the second half the names and the depth
of the colours they transmit. For instance—

The equation of a colour matched by 17Â·0 red
and 2Â·6 blue units, is as follows:—

Standard Glasses.  Colour Developed.

Red.   Blue.         Violet.   Red.

17Â·0 + 2Â·6     =     2Â·6 + 14Â·4

The colour developed is a red violet in these proportions.

A colour matched by

Standard Glasses.  Colour Developed.

Red.   Yellow.       Orange.   Red.

10Â·0 + 3Â·0     =    3Â·0 + 7Â·0

The colour developed is a red orange in these
proportions.

[23]

A colour matched by

Standard Glasses.  Colour Developed.

Yellow.   Blue.        Green.  Yellow.

3Â·0  +  1Â·5     =     1Â·5  +  1Â·5

The colour developed is a yellow green in these
proportions.

A colour matched by

Standard Glasses.  Colour Developed.

Blue.    Red.           Blue.   Violet.

6Â·0  +  1Â·8     =     4Â·2  +  1Â·8

The colour developed is a blue violet in these
proportions.

The standard glass colours are necessarily of a
given brightness, and colours for measurement may
be either brighter, or sadder than the standards.

A given complex colour of less than glass standard
brightness, is matchable by unequal numbers
from the three standard scales; the smallest unit
value always represents the âblack,â or neutral
unit factor. The equation is as follows:—

A colour matched by

Standard Glasses.     Colour Developed.

Red.  Yellow.  Blue.
Neutral Tint.  Green.  Blue.

1Â·0  +  3Â·0  +  9Â·0      =
1Â·0    +   2Â·0   +  6Â·0

The colour is a blue green, in the proportion of
six to two, saddened by one of neutral tint.

A given complex colour of greater brightness than
the glass standards, is first dulled by the interception
of neutral tint units, until measurable in the
manner described above; the intercepting glasses
[24]

represent the unit value of excess of brightness, and is
shown in the equation as light units, for instance—

Standard Glasses.                     Colour Developed.

Neutral Tint. Yellow.  Blue.          Light.  Green.  Yellow.

1Â·5      +      7Â·5   +   0Â·5
=     1Â·5 + 0Â·5 + 7Â·0

The colour is a yellow green in the proportions of
7Â·0 of yellow, to 0Â·5 of green, and 1Â·5 brighter
than the standards.

Every daylight colour being thus measurable by
a suitable combination of standard glasses, with
or without the addition of a Light, or a Neutral Tint
factor, it follows that any colour can be described
both qualitatively, and quantitatively, in terms
of the colour sensations yielded by the standard
glasses and their combination. The distinct colour
sensations are those, which, by common consent are
known as Red, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Green and
Violet, and they are yielded by single glasses, or
by pairs as already described; all colours therefore
fall into the following categories:—

A.
—Single colour sensations:—

1. Transmitted by single glass standards:

Red.

Yellow.

Blue.

2. Transmitted by equivalent pairs of standard
glasses:

Orange.

Green.

Violet.

B.
—Double colour sensations transmitted by
unequal pairs of standard glasses.

[25]

Red orange, transmitted by unequal units of red
and yellow, red preponderating.

Yellow orange, transmitted by unequal units of
red and yellow, yellow preponderating.

Yellow green, transmitted by unequal units of
yellow and blue, yellow preponderating.

Blue green, transmitted by unequal units of yellow
and blue, blue preponderating.

Blue violet, transmitted by unequal units of blue
and red, blue preponderating.

Red violet, transmitted by unequal units of blue
and red, red preponderating.

C.
—Any of the above colours with the addition
or subtraction of neutral tint.

Neutral tint itself, is transmitted by a combination
of equal units of the standard glasses, thus
three units red, yellow and blue, when superposed,
transmit three units neutral tint.

Examples.

Three units red, of standard brightness, completely
describes a colour matched by a red glass
of three units, and is denoted

R. 3Â·0

Three units red saddened by one neutral tint,
completely describes a colour matched by a red
glass standard of four units red, combined with a
blue and yellow of one unit each, and is denoted

R. 3Â·0 + N.T. 1Â·0

A given red of three units, which is one unit brighter
than standards, after having been saddened by
[26]

one unit each of red, yellow and blue, is matched
by three units of red and is correctly described by

Red 3Â·0 + Light 1Â·0

Three units of violet, of standard brightness, is
matched by a red and a blue glass of three units,
and is correctly described by

V. 3Â·0

Three units of orange, of standard brightness, is
matched by a red and a yellow glass of three units,
and is correctly described by

O. 3Â·0

A binary red violet of standard brightness, in
which red preponderates by one unit, is matched
by four units red, and a blue of three units, and is
correctly described by

R. 1Â·0 + V. 3Â·0

A binary red orange, of standard brightness, in
which orange preponderates by three units, is
matched by red four and yellow three units, and
is correctly described by

R. 1Â·0 + O. 3Â·0

A red orange, of less than standard brightness by
one unit, in which orange preponderates by three
units, is matched by a red five, yellow four, blue one,
and is correctly described by

R. 1Â·9 + O. 3Â·0 + N.T. 1Â·0

A red violet, in which red preponderates by one
unit, and is one unit brighter than standard, is first
dulled by one unit red, yellow and blue, and then
[27]

matched by four red and three blue, and is correctly
described by

R. 1Â·0 + V. 3Â·0 + Light 1Â·0

A red orange, in which red preponderates by one
unit, and is one unit brighter than standard, is first
dulled by one red, yellow and blue, and then matched
by four red, and three yellow, and is correctly
described by

R. 1Â·0 + O. 3Â·0 + Light 1Â·0

[28]

CHAPTER VIII.

The Colour Scales.

A normal vision under ordinary conditions,
has no hesitation in correctly naming the
sensations produced by the triad groups red, yellow
and blue, or by the single rays orange, green and
violet. It can also correctly describe a complex
colour sensation, by naming the two associated
colours, such as red orange, yellow orange, blue
green, blue violet, etc.; but when called upon to
decide differences of colour depth, it can only do
so by using arbitrary terms of no precise scientific
value, such as light, medium, dark, etc.

This deficiency is because the vision has in itself
no arrangement for the quantitative definition of
colour depth. This want can only be met by co-relating
colour sensations, to some physical colour
constants.

This co-relation has now been effected by a series
of glass standard colour scales, which are numerically
graded for colour depth, the scales themselves
being colour constants by co-relation to percentage
solutions, of such coloured chemicals, as copper
sulphate, nickel sulphate, potassium permanganate,
[29]

etc. These substances as well as many others, are
always available for checking the constancy of
the scales, or for recovering the unit if lost.

As already mentioned, the system of taper scales
proved to be useless for the purpose, not only because
the rate of colour increase was never in proportion
to the rate of thickness increase, but also because
no two substances are equal in this respect, each
having a rate specific to itself.

The prismatic spectrum colours were not available
for several reasons, first as being unsuitable for
critical comparisons under daylight conditions, as
being too weak except âin cameraâ; also they were
found to be too crowded for the separation of a
working area of monochromatic colour, and some
corrections would have been necessary for variation
in the refractions of different colour rays. This is
more fully dealt with under the heading of The
Spectrum in relation to Colour Standardization,
page 36.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF THE COLOUR SCALES.

The method employed for obtaining equality of
the unit divisions, and colour equivalence between
the different scales was as follows:—

Two slips of red glass in a light shade were made
exactly equal in colour, and considered as initial
units; these were then superimposed and matched
by a single glass, which was then considered as of
two units, this and one of the initial units were superimposed,
and matched by a single glass of three
colour units, and so on, until a progressive red scale
[30]

was constructed, ranging in intensity from Â·01 to 20Â·
units.
[3]

The yellow and blue scales, were similarly constructed,
taking care that their similar unit values
were in colour equivalence with the red units, the
test of equivalence being, that when equal units of
the three scales were superimposed against a normal
white light, a neutral grey was transmitted, in
which no trace of colour could be perceived by the
common consent of the whole staff of trained observers.

The scales were then considered as in colour
equivalence with each other. The system of cross-checking
was so elaborate, that after the equivalence
of the first unit was established, nearly four years
was occupied in the work before the scales were
passed as satisfactory.

It may be urged that the unit is arbitrary, but
this applies also to the unit of any other standard
scale; it is sufficient that the essentials of a philosophic
scale are complied with, in that the divisions
are equal, and the unit recoverable.

CHAPTER IX.

Colour Charts.

A colour chart is constructed by placing two
colour scales at right angles to each other,
with their zeros at the angle.

A measured simple colour, finds its position
directly on its corresponding colour scale at the
point of its measured value.

A measured complex colour, finds its position
within the angle, at that point where perpendiculars
drawn through the two colour values meet.

The above statements are complete only for
colours of standard brightness, should the colour
be brighter or duller than standards, a light factor
is necessary, the value of which is furnished by the
measurement itself, and must be written in numerals
near the colour point.

By this method the chart position of even the
most complicated colour is indicated by a single
point which is determined by the analytical value
of the composing factors.

Examples.

[32]

The number of complex colour charts is limited
to the six represented in
Fig. 1
as lying in their
order on a continuous spectrum. The red and
violet mixtures having no visible spectrum position
are represented in the ultra violet. The ordinates
of the charts are made by erecting the overlying
red, yellow and blue scales as perpendiculars.

Fig. 1.

The information to be obtained by charting
measured colour is more extensive than appears at
first sight, as by varying the character of the co-ordinates,
and charting suitable series of measurements,
new fields of investigation are opened,
thus throwing light on some hitherto obscure questions,
of which the following are some instances.

SPECIFIC COLOUR.

It has sometimes been assumed that colour
increase was in direct ratio to intensity increase,
but this is never the case, each substance has its
own rate, specific to itself. It is conceivable that
the colours of two substances may coincide at one
point, but as their densities increase, or decrease,
their rates of change vary.

The term â
Specific Colour
â is based on the experimental
fact, that the colour of a given substance
[33]

is constant, so long as the substance itself and the
conditions of observation, remain unaltered. During
experimental work a sufficient number of instances
have accumulated to warrant the writer in
advancing and using the term â
Specific Colour
â as
describing a new natural law, as rigid in its application
as that of âSpecific Gravityâ or âSpecific
Heat.â

PLATE V

ABSORPTION CURVES OF FIVE COLOUR CONSTANTS.

To face page 33.
[
Lovibond, Colour Theories.

When this principle is applied to the measurement
of regularly increasing thicknesses, curves of
colour changes can be established, which are specific
for the substance in question, and afford a certain
means of identifying similar substances in future.
This is effected by varying the nature of the co-ordinates,
making the ordinates to represent the
tintometrical scale of colour units irrespective of
colour, whilst the abscissae represent the scale of
increasing thicknesses. Then by plotting the
separate factors of each measurement according to
their unit values, a series of curves is established,
specific to the substance in question, and applicable
to none other.

We have now two systems of charting colour, in
the first, the complete sensation is represented by a
single point, as in Plate IV. In the second, each
factor is represented by a separate point, and by
connecting points of similar colours, a series of
curves is established which represents a quantitative
analysis of the progressive colour development, as
in Plate V.

[34]

CHAPTER X.

Representations of Colour in Space of
Three Dimensions.

The relations of the different colours to one
another, and to neutral tint are, perhaps,
best represented to the mind by a solid model, or
by reference to three co-ordinate axes, as employed
in solid geometry (
see

Fig. 2
).

Fig. 2.

Let the three adjacent edges OR, OB, OY, of the
above cube be three axes, along which are measured
degrees of Red, Yellow and Blue respectively, starting
from the origin O. Every point in space on
[35]

the positive side of this origin will then represent
a conceivable colour, the constituents of which in
degrees of red, yellow and blue are measured by
the three co-ordinates of the points. Pure reds
lie all along the axis OR, pure yellows on the axis
OY, and pure blues on the axis OB.

All normal oranges, normal greens, and normal
violets lie on the diagonals of the faces of the cubes
OO
1
, OG, OV respectively.

Pure neutral tints lie on the diagonal ON of the
cube, equally inclined to the three principal axes.

Red violets will be found on the plane ROB,
between OV and OR.

Blue violets on the same plane between OV and
OB.

âSaddenedâ red violets all within the wedge or
open space enclosed by the three planes, whose
boundaries are OB, OV, ON.

The other colours, red and yellow oranges, blue
and yellow greens, pure and saddened, are found in
corresponding positions in relation to the other
cases.
[4]

[36]

CHAPTER XI.

The Spectrum in relation to Colour
Standardization.

The spectrum has naturally been considered
as a suitable source for colour standards,
but the power of analysing has disclosed some difficulties,
which have yet to be overcome.

Concerning the prismatic spectrum, there has
always been a difficulty in apportioning the different
colours to specific areas, and further, before
this spectrum is available for colour standardization,
some method of correction for the unequal distribution
of colours must be devised.

Neither of these difficulties occur in the use of
the diffraction spectrum, where the pure colours are
apportioned by Professor Rood from A to H in the
manner shown in table on next page.

Professor Rood further divides the spectrum from
A to H into 100 equal divisions, allotting 20 unit
divisions of 72,716 wave lengths to the space between
each two colour lines. This allots a space
of 3,635 W.L. to each unit division, as shown in
Table III.

Having provided equal wave length positions
for the six pure colours, the intermediate colours
are necessarily binaries in definite proportions,
accounted for by a regular overlapping of two
bounding colours in opposite directions from zero to
20, as shown in the following table from Red to
Orange, representing the space between these two
pure colours.

It follows, that apart from the six monochromes,
all spectrum complex colours in a single wave
length must be binaries, whose united values equal 20.

On comparing Professor Roodâs scales of divisions
with those of the tintometrical scales already described,
[38]

they appear to coincide in several particulars,
for instance:—

The monochromes correspond both in number
and in name.

Their positions in the scales correspond.

Their unit divisions are equal in number, and in
dimensions.

Their colour positions correspond, when an artificial
tintometrical spectrum is made by regularly
overlapping monochromes.

It follows that when the two scales are superimposed
as in Plate V., showing similar monochromes
as lying in the same perpendicular, the
same wave length numbers apply to both; concerning
the dimensions between the monochromes, the
spaces occupied by 72,716 wave lengths between
the spectrum monochromes, also represent similar
spaces in the tintometrical scales, and one-twentieth
of this 3,635 represents the space of a single unit
in each case.

In connexion with these co-related dimensions,
some information is obtainable bearing on the
limitation of a monochromatic vision for discriminating
small colour differences. Under ordinary daylight
conditions, the unit in the lighter shades of the
tintometrical scale is divided into 100 fractional
parts, each fraction therefore represents a space
occupied by thirty-six wave lengths in the spectrum
scale. This may be near the limit of dimension for
monochromatic vision in such a gradually changing
colour scale, as that of the spectrum, and may be
some guide as to suitable slit areas in the synthetical
building up of complex coloured light.

PLATE VI

SIX COLOUR CHARTS IN ONE OR ANOTHER OF WHICH ANY SIMPLE OR COMPLEX
COLOUR FINDS A DEFINITE POSITION.

To face page 39.
[
Lovibond, Colour Theories.

[39]

In Plate VI. are shown the six tintometrical colour
charts, as lying in their order on the tintometrical
spectrum, illustrating that any measured colour
factor lies in a perpendicular drawn through both
spectra, and occupying the same wave length position,
and may therefore be designated by that wave
length number.

This explanation is not intended to convey that
the colour energies do not really overlap beyond
the boundaries of the dual combinations, but only
that the vision is unable to distinguish as colour,
such overlapping if it exists.

POINTS OF DIFFERENCE.

On further comparisons of the two scales there
are some points of difference which have a bearing
on their values as colour standards.

There is a variation in the length of the two
scales, the spectrum terminating at H, whilst the
tintometrical scale is extended to a sixth division
in the region of the ultra violet, showing overlapping
combinations of Red and Violet, strictly
analogous to the overlapping binaries in the other
five sections.

These red and violet combinations constitute
one-sixth of the cycle of distinguishable colours,
and cannot be omitted in any system of colour
standardization, therefore their absence in the
continuous spectrum is a drawback.

A second drawback, is the limited number of
spectrum complex colours, in consequence of each
colour being blended only with overlapping colour
value, which lies in its own wave length, whereas in
[40]

nature each colour may be blended with any value
of the overlapping colour. In the tintometrical
standards, similar effects are obtained by changing
the value of the graded slips.

It is true, that complex colours other than those
in the same wave length, may be developed by blending
two colours from different parts of the spectrum,
but the ray proportions of colours so produced, are
necessarily more complex than those developed
by specific absorption; the first being a method of
synthesis towards complexity, and the second a
method of analysis towards simplicity, and although
two colours so produced may be similar in name,
red for instance, they must differ in character.
This view may tend to reconcile some of the theoretical
differences between Scientists and Artists.

THE ULTRA VIOLET DIVISION.

The complete range of daylight colours not being
fully comprised in a continuous spectrum, may be
considered as a cycle of radiant energies, sensitive
to the vision as colour, which can be represented as
a circle as in Plate VII. The outer and broken circle
represents a bent spectrum, the unoccupied division
corresponding in position with that of the red and
violet mixtures in the complete cycle.

This arrangement does not alter the relative positions
of the Fraunhoper lines A, B, C, D, E, F, G
and H in reference to either scale, but, it theoretically
breaks that sequence of the successive
wave lengths in the Red Violet which holds good
in the other five divisions from A to H.

PLATE VII

To face page 40.
[
Lovibond, Colour Theories.

[41]

In order to theoretically avoid this juxtaposition
of wave length contrast, it is only necessary to
imagine that the violet energy beyond H in the
ultra violet, is overlapped by the infra red energy
of a succeeding spectrum, filling this section with
a series of overlapping binaries analogous in wave
length sequence to that of the other sections.

A RESIDUAL RED RAY.

Apart from the colours of everyday life there is,
in sunlight and most direct artificial lights, an
additional red energy which differs materially from
the red energy in diffused daylight.

It was first noticed whilst establishing the colour
equivalence of the tintometrical light unit, by developing
a red sensation which disturbed constancy
of reading under certain conditions of light.

So far as the writer knows, this energy has never
been investigated as separate from the other spectrum
red. The following observations must be
considered as tentative only.

SOME PROPERTIES.

It does not obey the laws of absorption which
govern the red of diffused daylight. When
the six transparent pigmentary colours are illuminated
by direct sunlight, and viewed through a
sufficient number of Neutral Tint units, the colours
all disappear, all appearing red alike, with only
differences in luminosity.

The spectrum position of this red energy is in
the A. B. region, and further interception by
[42]

Neutral Tint whilst narrowing the band, intensifies
the colour, until obstructed by the large number
of intercepting glass surfaces.

It has no photographic action on the six
sensitised papers dealt with in the photographic
section.

LIGHT INTENSITIES.

The apparatus for determining the unit values
of light intensities in the following series of measurements,
consisted of a conical rectangular hopper
tapering from 2 feet to 2 inches square. This was
adapted so that the light from the small end, commanded
the stage of the optical instrument sufficiently
close to cut off outside light. The wide end
facing a north sky was adapted with sliding shutters,
to regulate the area of incident light; of the
six water-colour pigments which nearest corresponded
to the standard colours, washed to their full
depth on Whatmanâs paper, six measurements were
made. These measurements are shown in Table IV,
and classified in Table V.

It will be noted that the readings are constant
for all the colours between 16 and 26 units, except a
variation of light Â·15 in the 24-inch opening, which
is in effect as if the cone was not present, and Â·2 in
the 8-inch area of orange.

Note.
—Experiments in this branch give some information relating to
the perception of colour under daylight conditions, by limiting the range
of intensities within which colour can be distinguished and differentiated,
whilst their separate photographic action (page 48) suggests the impression
that colour phenomena, outside these limits, may be a physiological
expression of widely varying underlying energies.

CHAPTER XII.

The Physiological Light Unit.

DIFFUSED LIGHT.

The physiological values of light intensities
determined by the absorptive method, differ
in some respects, from the intensities based on the
inverse ratio of the squares of distance between the
shadows of two lights.

However valuable this method of calculating light
intensities may be from a mathematical point of
view, it does not express the physiological appreciation
of light differences.

The dimensions of the light unit used in the following
experiments have already been described.

This method cannot deal exhaustively with intense
direct lights, on account of the presence (activity)
of the disturbing red ray which prevents total
absorption. Such lights must first be modified by
intercepting media of known diffusive value, or
by reflection from a white surface.

One object of these experiments was to obtain
more insight into the physiological conditions of
light, as bearing on the question of standardization.

The first two experiments are records of intensity
changes by time, in Morning and Evening light, and
[46]

are of interest, as bearing on the lowest luminosities
for reading, for viewing objects at different distances,
and for defining the limits at which colours
visually disappear. The measurements are marked
in neutral tint units and plotted in curves in Charts
1 and 2.

The numbers on the single curve in the Morning
chart represent total absorption of the direct light
20 degrees above the horizon. The upper curve
in the Evening chart also represents the direct light,
whilst the under curve represents the light values as
reflected from a lime sulphate surface; except in
the case of the reading notes when it represents the
printed paper surface. The difference between the
two curves is the loss of light incident on reflection,
but this must not be rigidly interpreted for all
cases, as there is reason for supposing it varies with
different lights.

DIRECT LIGHTS.

In measuring the physiological intensity of direct
lights, the presence (activity) of the unabsorbable
red ray, prevents their being dealt with directly by
the absorptive method. Such lights can, however,
be made measurable by a sufficient diffusion, as
already explained in the case of direct sunlight, the
proportion of diffusion required, being more or less
according to the intensity of the light; in the following
examples, one reflection from a white surface
or from the ordinary grease spot arrangement, was
found to be sufficient.

Note.
—Light reflected from grease is not above suspicion,
it being governed by the law of specific absorption already
dealt with.

[52]

The experiments were carried out on a home-made
twelve-foot photometer, with the usual protected
lantern at each end, one being removed for present
purposes. The grease spot carrier was replaced by
a one-foot square diaphragm, with a standard white
surface; this travelled the whole length of the
photometer at right angles to the light, and the
readings made at one-foot intervals at an angle of
45 degrees, 10 inches distance from the white surface.

Charts 3, 4 and 5 deal with experiments, with
one, two and three standard candles of the London
Gas Referees. The curves represent the physiological
rate of declining luminosities by distance. Some
characteristic differences from other lights are
brought together in Charts 4 and 5. The slight
irregularities in the curves are probably due to the
readings being made at half unit intervals. These
acting sometimes in opposite directions, fully account
for want of symmetry in the curves.

A noticeable feature in these experiments is the
small amount of physiological luminosity added by
each successive candle to the first. Theoretically,
if one candle equals 21 units intensity, two should
equal 42, and three 63, whereas the physiological
additions of luminosity are not only much less, but
vary with different luminous intensities, as will be
seen by the following comparisons:—

PHOTOGRAPHIC ENERGIES OF DIFFERENT RAYS

The following experiments are preliminary only,
and were undertaken to determine the relationship
of the several colours of the tintometrical scales, to
their associated photographic values, under different
conditions of light and times of exposure, the end in
view being the hope of standardizing screens, papers
and impressions.

The standardized colours act as selective light absorbents
on the same principle as screens for trichromatic
colour work, but differ from these in their
having a definite standard of colour depth and colour
purity.

Work of this character requires paper of a known
degree of sensitiveness, but on inquiry it was found
that no reliable standard had as yet been established.
On this, six makes of âwhiteâ paper were purchased
[54]

in the open market and submitted to exposures under
the following conditions:—

Six slips of the sensitized papers were covered by
a thin metal plate, pierced by six rows of apertures,
a complete row lying over each sample of paper. The
rows contained seven apertures each, one being left
uncovered to receive the full energy of the impinging
light. The remaining six were covered respectively
by a Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue or Violet
standardized screen of 15 units colour intensity; the
whole was fitted into a suitable exposure frame.
Many exposures were made, from which the four
following were selected:—

No. 1. 20 min. exposure to a dull sky.

No. 2. 10 min. exposure to bright sunlight.

No. 3. 20 min. exposure to bright sunlight.

No. 4. 30 min. exposure to bright sunlight.

The results are arranged in Tables VI and VII.

Table VII contains results of different exposures
under sunlight conditions.

the results show considerable differences, both in

been exhausted by 30 min. sunlight exposure.

Other noticeable points are the small action under
the Orange, Green and Violet screens, and the greater,
although variable proportion of colour to black under
all the colour screens.

TRICHROMATIC COLOUR SCREENS.

Table VIII contains the colour measurements of five

Appendix I

COLOUR EDUCATION

The time has passed when it might have been considered
necessary to preface a handbook on the teaching of colour
by arguments to prove that it is a legitimate subject of
instruction in schools, but it has not hitherto been sufficiently
recognized that the early stages of such instruction must
be on sound lines and that nothing must be taught which
will afterwards have to be unlearned.

Apart from the pleasure its sensations give to all properly
constituted persons, the study of colour has an intellectual
value in common with other branches of science. It
strengthens the judgment by constantly requiring thought
and precision in definition, it also develops the faculty of
colour perception even to the point of curing some forms of
colour blindness. In addition to this, it forms a necessary
part of the instruction in all schools in which drawing is
properly taught by methods which demand from the pupils
faithful representations of the appearances of actual objects
in colour as they are seen.

In the past the systematic study of colour has been
more or less neglected from two principal causes: first,
the want of a comprehensive scheme of colour nomenclature
capable of describing all colours in terms precise enough
for general understanding and record; and, second, the
absence of any reliable means of reproducing any specific
[60]

colour if lost or faded. Both these conditions may now
be secured by the use of the standardized coloured glasses
supplied with the Colour Educator, and this work is intended
to bring the subject before teachers in such a way as
to make each point perfectly easy of demonstration to a class
in a systematic manner.

To-day the value and importance of a keen perception
of colour and of an apparatus furnishing definite colour
standards, though perhaps not much appreciated by the
general public, are widely recognized in the industrial and
scientific world; and it is evident that in these days of
keen commercial competition between nations we cannot
afford to neglect any means which will enable us to maintain
present industries and to develop new ones.

General Remarks.
—It is not advisable to introduce
colour theories to pupils before they know the names of
the different colours, but, as the glasses used in the apparatus
are graded for colour-depth according to a set of scales now
generally accepted as of standard value, a short description
of the derivation of the colour names will be of service when
the pupils are sufficiently advanced.

The names of the six spectrum colours, Red, Orange,
Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet, are accepted by common
consent as describing the principal hues into which a beam
of white light can be resolved by a diffraction grating or
by prismatic refraction. They are also the colours distinguishable
in objects of everyday life, and the following
Educational Method is based on the fact that they can be
separated at will from ordinary daylight. Therefore the first
educational step is to associate these six colour rays with
their respective names, the pupils being made to understand
that there are many degrees of depth in each
colour.

[61]

The Applications of Colour to the Work of Everyday
Life
are so universal that a complete list is almost impossible,
though some of the most important are mentioned
below. In a general way the visual characteristics of
every visible object are determined by contrasts of light
and colour, outline itself being governed by differences of
light intensity.

In Nature, colour is practically universal. There are
few objects perfectly white. Most of them have colour of
greater or less complexity; even snow under a cloudless
sky has a blue tint which is measurable against such white
objects as pure lime sulphate, zinc white, etc., the blue
tint being manifestly reflected from the cloudless sky, as it
disappears under a cloudy overcast.

Some of the Scientific Applications of Colour.
—It
associates colour sensations with definite names and
values; discovers and classifies cases of colour-blindness,
and is a preparation for the physical study of light. It is
also essential for studying the physiological structure of
the organs of vision, for disclosing abnormal conditions
of the blood, and for measuring the colour of the hair and
skin for the anthropological classification of races. It is
used in general laboratory work for analytical and original
investigation; and it furnishes standards of value for the
petroleum industry, the International Tanning Association,
the inter-States Cotton Seed Oil Association, etc. It is
also one of the principal factors in all artistic industries;
for, besides having an important educational value in
questions of harmony, contrast, and taste, it is of direct commercial
value in such industries as dyeing, calico printing,
all woollen industries, wall-paper printing, paint making,
house decoration, etc.

[62]

General Instructions for Using the Apparatus.
—The
apparatus consists of a frame having six little windows,
fitted with sliding shutters, and a tray containing eighteen
standardized glasses.

The frame must be placed on a table or stand facing the
children, with a window or some other source of diffused
white light behind it. Care must be taken not to have a
coloured background of any kind.

The glasses are in three colours, Red, Yellow, and Blue,
of different depths. The depth of colour is marked in
figures on each glass, and corresponding numbers in the
three colours are of equal intensity. It is of importance
that the six spectrum colour terms should be the only ones
used in the preliminary stages. The first step in colour
teaching must be to develop and train the perceptive
faculties of the children so as to enable them to express
in words the colour sensations which are excited. For
this purpose it is necessary to begin by demonstrating
that the six spectrum colours Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,
Blue, and Violet, are derived from white light.

Red, Yellow, and Blue should first be dealt with, and

for practical work
each pupil should be supplied with three
water-colour pigments closely corresponding in hue to the
standardized glasses, viz., Crimson Lake, Lemon Yellow,
and Cobalt Blue; also with a piece of white paper ruled
into six small rectangular spaces corresponding to the little
windows of the apparatus.

As each colour is demonstrated by means of the glass in
the apparatus, each pupil should paint the corresponding
pigment in its proper place on the paper.

The little shutters being placed in all the six little windows,
remove the top left-hand shutter and insert a deep
Red

glass, thus showing

[63]

Red.
—The pupils will name this and then paint the
corresponding colour on their papers.

Next, remove the shutter below the first one, and insert
a
Yellow
glass of the same numerical value as the Red one,
thus showing

Yellow.
—The pupils will name this and then paint the
corresponding colour on their papers.

Now remove the shutter next below and insert a
Blue

glass of the same numerical value as the Red and Yellow
ones, thus showing

Blue.
—The pupils will name this and then paint the
corresponding colour on their papers.

There are now exposed to view the three colours which
are by artists commonly called primaries, but it will be
found convenient to term Red, Yellow, and Blue the
Dominant

colours of this system.

The second step is to show how the three secondary or
subordinate colours are derived or developed.

Remove the top right-hand shutter and insert a deep
Red and a deep Yellow glass of equal depth, showing the
[64]

pupils that these two colours combined in equal proportions
develop

Orange.
—The pupils will name this, and will then mix
their Red and Yellow pigments to obtain a similar Orange
which will be painted in its proper place on their papers.

Now remove the shutter next below and insert a deep
Yellow and a deep Blue glass of equal depth, showing the
pupils that these two colours combined in equal proportions
develop

Green.
—The pupils will name this, and will then mix their
Blue and Yellow pigments to obtain a similar Green which
will be painted in its proper place on their papers.

Remove the last right-hand shutter and insert a deep
Red and a deep Blue glass of equal depth, showing that
these two colours combined in equal proportions develop

Violet.
—The pupils will name this, and mix their Blue
and Red pigments to obtain a similar Violet, which will also
be painted in its proper place on their papers.

Now are exposed to view on the left-hand side the three
primary or dominant colours, and on the right-hand side
[65]

the three secondary or subordinate colours, and the whole
frame is filled with the six spectrum colours in equal colour
depth. Corresponding to the colours in the frame, each
pupilâs paper should show a similar arrangement of colours,
and the pupils can be taught their spectrum order by reading
them in rows horizontally—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,
Blue, and Violet.

The teacher should now take out the coloured glasses
and replace the shutters, except the two top windows, one
of which is left open to show white light, and the other
filled with three equally deep glasses in Red, Yellow, and
Blue, showing either black or neutral grey, and demonstrating
the total or partial absorption of light according to
their higher or lower numerical unit value. It is of the
utmost importance to bear in mind that the glasses are
graded for diffused daylight, and that all artificial lights are
more or less coloured and would give a different effect.
The same remark applies to light taken direct from coloured
objects.

In this set the six windows are in one horizontal line, and
should be uncovered in the following order:

{ No. 1 Window for Red.

Dominants      { No. 3 Window for   Yellow.

{ No. 5 Window for Blue.

{ No. 2 Window for Orange.

Subordinates       { No. 4 Window for Green.

{ No. 6 Window for Violet.

One advantage in this method is that when all the
colours are in they are arranged in their spectrum order.

Complex Colours.
—We have demonstrated that single
standard glasses develop the three Dominant colours, Red,
Yellow, and Blue, and that pairs of equal standard glasses
[66]

develop the three Subordinate colours, Orange, Green, and
Violet. In order to produce complex colours two standard
glasses of unequal value must be used. The degree of
inequality does not alter the spectroscopic names of complex
colours, variation in proportions being only a statement
of degree.

A reference to the circles, 7, 8, and 9, on the cards supplied
with the apparatus will show that all complex colours are
members of the same triad group, and experiments have
shown that the six combinations above are the only ones
distinguishable in Nature, subject, however, to unlimited
variations in brightness or dullness. It remains to be shown
how these variations are effected.

Variations in brightness are produced by inserting with
the two glasses forming a complex colour the third spectrum
colour, always bearing in mind that it must be less in value
than either of the other two. The addition of the third
colour has a dulling or saddening effect, the degree of which
is determined by the numerical value of the third colour.
The colour produced by the addition of the third colour may
be termed a saddened or dingy colour, the appearance being
that of a brighter colour seen in shadow.

Reviewing the foregoing, it is demonstrated that primary
or dominant colours are transmitted by a single coloured
standard glass; the secondary or subordinate colours are
transmitted by two equal standard glasses of different colours;
[67]

the complex colours by two unequal standard glasses of
different colours. Saddened pure colours are developed
either by one coloured standard glass combined with two
equal standard glasses of different colours and lesser value
or by two equal standard glasses of different colours and a
third of lesser value. Saddened complex colours by three
unequal standard glasses of different colours. Greys, which
are steps towards blackness, are produced by three equal
standard glasses of different colours.

It is well known that Colour Blindness is a defect in the
vision often involving the confusion of such utterly distinct
colour sensations as Red and Green, Orange and Violet,
and many others as widely different. In the cases of Red
and Green the confusions are specially disastrous should
the subject be a railwayman or a sailor. It is not, however,
so well known that many cases of so-called Colour
Blindness are in reality cases of Colour Ignorance, and
the capacity for distinguishing between colours and shades
is often latent, and only waiting to be developed by
Education.

When a child persistently misnames colours after having
received an amount of instruction sufficient to remove colour
ignorance in a normal case, the errors are probably due to
some form of colour blindness.

Such cases should be registered for further examination,
taking note of the miscalled colours. It would be an
additional precaution to change the position of the colours
in the windows of the apparatus, in order to prevent the
association of colours with their positions as first given in
the instructions.

colour standards in the Colour Educator are tabulated below,

In mixing two dominant colours (artistsâ primaries) to
develop subordinates (artistsâ secondaries), their relative
colour depth must be taken into account; for instance,
Crimson Lake has a natural colour depth nearly three
times that of Lemon Yellow; therefore, in order to develop
a normal Orange nearly three times the quantity of Yellow
must be used, presuming that they were originally ground
to an equal degree of fineness.

It is desirable that a record of the childrenâs own painting
should be preserved, with a view to discriminating between
errors arising from Colour Blindness and Colour Ignorance,
the former perpetuating itself, and the latter naturally
remedying itself. For this purpose painting books containing
sets of diagrams corresponding to the figures in
the foregoing pamphlet can be supplied.

[69]

Appendix II

THE POSSIBILITIES OF A STANDARD
LIGHT AND COLOUR UNIT.
[5]

The past attempts to standardize light and colour are
mainly limited to those radiant energies which excite light
and colour sensations under diffused daylight conditions,
because in direct sunlight, and in most artificial lights, there
are other colour energies, which, unless sufficiently modified
by diffusion, disturb the colour readings. There are also
latent colour energies, which only become distinguishable
by special means. They do not, however, appear to influence
diffused daylight colour work.

The definition of a normal vision is one which agrees
with a majority of others. This definition has proved
satisfactory up to the present, as the normals are many and
the colour blind few.

Light Intensities.
—There are two methods of determining
light intensities by means of a graded scale of light
absorbents.

First. By total absorption of the light, when the intensity
is directly represented by the unit value of the
absorbents required. This method is applicable for low
lights, internal surfaces, such as a desk, etc., where a
standard light is not available for comparison.

[70]

Second. By the reduction of a standard light by absorption
until it equals the light of the object. In this case
the standard must be originally brighter than the object.

Constants.
—The first requirement in establishing a scale
of light and colour units is a means of co-relating visual
sensations to a scale of physical colour constants, in order
to secure a power of record and recovery. There is no
natural scale available for quantitative colour work, but
artificial scales can be constructed, and made constants by
co-relation at different points with physical colour constants,
and by cross-checking the intervals between these.

The scales used in the âtintometerâ consist of red, yellow
and blue glass, so graded in equivalents that combinations
of equal units transmit colourless light. Full details of
these have already been placed before the Society (see this

Jour.
, 1887, p. 186, and 1908, p. 36).

Scale of Luminous Intensities.

The Light Unit.
—The
natural terminals in a scale of luminous intensities are
black and white, and the first question which arises is
what is black, and what is white? as when used in a popular
sense each term covers a wide range of differences.

In the authorâs sense the term black means total absence
of light, and the term white means a diffused daylight of
given intensity, as reflected from a lime sulphate surface.
In this sense black and white are the terminals of a scale of
light intensities; the scale is divided into units and fractions
of units. The unit itself is physiological, and is not in
progressive accord with the mathematical light unit based
on the inverse squares of distance.

The Black Unit.
—Ideal black is practically obtained under
daylight conditions by viewing a hole in a box with blackened
interior, so arranged that no entering light can be reflected
back to the vision.

[71]

The box used for this purpose is illustrated in
Fig. 3
, and
has one surface covered with standard white for the purpose
of easy comparison with the pigments. The standard black
aperture (1) is in the middle. The pigmentary blacks (2 to
10) are arranged over this, and the pigmentary whites
and greys (11 to 20) underneath, each being numbered in
accord with its intensity as tabulated.

Fig. 3.

The degrees of blackness are the number of absorptive
units required to reduce the standard white to equal the
pigments in each case.

[72]

This gives a working scale of colourless light intensities,
the terminals being black and white, with a range of 36
units.

The Standard White.
—White is the natural terminal of the
luminous end of the scale, and it is necessary to select a
physical objective white as a constant. Pure precipitated
lime sulphate has been adopted, and departures from the
light intensity of this are recorded in units of lessened light
intensity throughout the scale, comprising all degrees of
colourless whites, greys, and blacks.

Strictly speaking, white is a qualitative term only,
until the degree of variation from the zero of the scale has
been established. The measured variation then takes its
position in the scale of luminous intensities according to
its numerical unit value.

As the scale is differentiated into hundredths of a unit,
there can be 100 variations of white pigments in a single
unit, each quite easily distinguishable from the others.

[73]

Any definite mixture of black and white finds a position
on the diagonal of a chart whose co-ordinates are the black
and white scales; for example, the 20 measured pigments are
charted on Figs.
4
and
5
, the latter being on an enlarged
scale, as the whites would be too crowded to be noted on

Fig. 4
.

Fig. 4.

The merging of white into grey, and of grey into black
is gradual, having no strict lines of demarcation.

An example of this method of determining light intensities
is illustrated in
Fig. 6
by the light intensities at which
different objects are discernible. The points of most interest
are, that colour is indistinguishable as such in lights below
15 units intensity; and that ordinary work, such as reading
a newspaper, requires for comfort a minimum of 28 units.

The Colour Unit.
—The colour unit is physiological, and its
dimensions are determined by the dimensions of the colourless
[74]

light from which it is derived. This deduction is
based on the experimental fact that colourless light is a
mixture of the six colour rays—red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, and violet—in equal proportion, as illustrated in
Fig.
7
, showing that a white light of 20 units light intensity is
made up to the six colour rays, each of 20 units colour intensity.
This is demonstrated by the fact that any proportion
of any colour can be developed at will by means of the
glass standard scales already mentioned; it follows that the
smallest disturbance of equivalence between the composing
rays results in the development of colour.

Fig. 5.

The above remarks apply to both simple and complex
colours, and the complex colours are always dichromes,
being governed by another physiological fact, which is:
That the vision is unable to simultaneously distinguish
[75]

more than two colours in the same beam of light. The
order of their association is definite, and may be described
by saying that the combined two are always adjacent
in their spectrum order, red and violet being considered
adjacent for this purpose. It follows that all complex
colours are binaries, and the only possible combinations
are as follows:—

Red    with Orange.

Orange with  Yellow.

Yellow with Green.

Green  with Blue.

Blue   with Violet.

Violet with Red.

Fig. 6.

In the authorâs colour nomenclature, a monochrome is
qualitatively described by a single term, and a complex
colour by a combination of two single terms. For a quantitative
description, it is only necessary to add the measured
[76]

unit value to each term. When there is excess of brightness,
or a saddening factor, these also must be quantitatively
estimated.

The colours developed by means of these scales are governed
by the same law of selective absorption which governs
the development of natural colours, any of which can be
matched and reproduced by means of their established ray
proportions.

Fig. 7.

The governing law is simple, and may be stated by saying
that the colour developed is always complementary to
the colour absorbed, not in the generally accepted sense
that their mixture necessarily makes white light, but in the
sense that they are opposite in the cycle of daylight colours.

The dimensions of the unit are necessarily arbitrary, it
was originally selected as being a convenient depth for
distinguishing differences, the scale was then constructed by
equal additions and sub-divisions; the two essentials of a
scientific scale being complied with, in that the divisions
were equal and the unit recoverable. The power of recovery
lies in the fact that different parts of the scale are co-related
to physical colour constants, which can be prepared in any
laboratory.

Specific Colour.
—The relationship of colour increase to intensity
increase in substances has hitherto been somewhat
obscure. It has been sometimes considered that they were
in direct proportion, but in the absence of a means of recording
colour sensations, no definite results were obtainable.

Fig. 8.

Sufficient information is now available to warrant the
formulation of the following law: âThat every substance
has its own rate of colour development for regularly increasing
intensities, which, when once established, becomes
a constant for identifying similar substances in future.â
This is the meaning of specific colour, and when a series
of measurements at regularly increasing densities of a given
substance have been made, the specific colour rate of that
substance is established. This can be charted in curves and
used as a basis for estimating quantities, properties, changes
of condition, differences in value, detecting adulteration, etc.

[78]

Applications.
—The author has permission to use the
names of several gentlemen who have used the tintometrical
scales for various purposes.

Sir Arthur H. Church, F.R.S., has employed the tintometrical
standards for the purpose of registering the
colours of certain wild flowers.

Sir Boverton Redwood has used the scales and system
for petroleum investigations. At his instance the specific
colour rate of petroleum was established, and the several
composing colours plotted in curves, as in
Fig. 8
, where the
ordinates represent the scale of units irrespective of colour,
and the abscissÃ¦ the scale of strata thicknesses.

The measurements were made at two-inch intervals, and
the four perpendicular lines are at the colour points selected
for valuing the four distinguishing marks, technically
known as âWater White,â âSuperfine,â âPrime,â and
âStandard.â Intermediate qualities find their position
in the scale of curves according to their measured colour
values.

This method of standardizing commercial values has
also been adopted by the International Tannersâ Association,
the Inter-States Cotton Seed Oil Association, and other oil
industries. Also for scale, solid fats, and such substances
as can be easily melted and measured by transmitted light.

Varying Effects of Different Lights.

Pathological
Applications.
—The law of specific colour development was
made use of by Dr. George Oliver in determining the degrees
of hÃ¦moglobin in the blood. The method is fully explained
in his Croonian Lecture before the Royal College of Physicians
of London, July 11, 1896.

Detection of Forgeries.
—The system and apparatus is
used by Professor A. S. Osborne, Examiner of Questioned
Documents, New York City, for determining the variety of
[79]

ink, the age of the writing, and the detection of forgeries.
A full description of the process will be found in his work
entitled

, published by the Lawyersâ
Co-operative Society, Rochester, N.Y.

in the priced samples is only a question of simple arithmetic,
which furnishes data for the valuation of the unpriced
samples.

[80]

The yield in the dye vat may not be in direct relation to
the solutions in water, the establishment of this is a question
for the expert, and presents no apparent difficulty.

The use of the scheme in recording the degree of fading
of dyes has been previously dealt with in the
Journal

(
q.v.
, 1908, p. 36).

Limitations and Precautions.
—It has been shown that we
have analytical control, within certain limits, of light and
colour under daylight conditions.

The general limits for colourless light range from total
darkness to 28 units, when the unabsorbable red ray comes
into evidence.

For colour, the general limits range from 28 to 18 units,
between 18 and 15 all colours become indistinct, but at
varying rates, below 15, colour is not distinguishable.

The principal disturbing conditions in making observations
are
want of colour education
and
insufficient diffusion
.
In the case of the latter, the first evidence is the disturbance
of constancy by the penetrating red ray. A partial
remedy is to interpose a white diffusion screen, such as tissue
paper.

Time of Observation.
—This should not exceed five consecutive
seconds, as the keenness of perception decreases by
time, but varies for different colours.

Angle of Incidence.
—Sixty degrees is safe for most solids,
but for bright or polished surfaces, such as varnishes,
polished metals, etc., the angle must be lessened as the degree
of smoothness increases. For very rough surfaces, such
as loosely woven stuffs, etc., care must be taken that the
lay of the fibre is uniform.

Distance from the Object.
—Ten inches has been adopted for
general work, but certain visions require more or less as
their focus varies from normal.

Unabsorbable Colours.
—In addition to the daylight
colours already dealt with, there are, in direct lights, colours
which do not obey the laws of absorption governing those of
diffused daylight.

The work already done on these unabsorbable rays has
only been incidental, where they happened to interfere with
the standardization of diffused daylight colours. The sensations
excited are red and violet. They blend, producing
red-violet mixtures, but in unequal proportions, the red being
dominant.

The red is developed in intense lights by constant interception
of neutral tint absorbents. In the case of a 4-volt
incandescent light, the first absorption simply reduces
the light intensity without developing colour; the light
is colourless up to 14 units. At 16 units the light begins
to assume a reddish hue, which rapidly becomes a brilliant
intense red by further interceptions of neutral tint absorbents.

Violet is developed by constant absorption by blue
standards, which grows in intensity by successive additions
up to about 120 units. Beyond this point the brilliancy
decreases.

Preliminary experiments point to this ray as fatal to
vegetation, and presumably also to lower forms of organic
life.

There remains a factor of considerable importance which
has not yet received the attention it deserves, the physiological
changes resulting from environment.

This aspect of the question has come under the notice
of the author by measuring the vision of experts who excelled
in given hues. It was generally found that their
vision was sensitive to a small increment of their particular
colour in harmonies where it was silent to a normal vision.

[82]

In seeking an explanation of this phenomenon there are at
least three possible lines for working:

First. Is the vision naturally more sensitive to that
particular energy?

Second. Is it by careful education?

Third. Is it an unconscious adaptation to surroundings,
such as other organs undergo under changes of environment?

Appendix III

THE APPLICATION OF THE NATURAL LAW OF
SPECIFIC COLOUR RATE BY DR. DUDLEY
CORBETT TO THE EXACT MEASUREMENT OF
X-RAY DOSAGE.

Dr. Dudley Corbett.

The gradations in the tint given by the Sabouraud-NoirÃ©
pastille when exposed to X-rays are so fine, especially in
that region of the colour scale where lies the erythema dose,
that many have felt the want of a more accurate means
of reading these tints, as well as a series of reliable
standards for comparison. Hitherto the only methods at
all generally used have been Hampsonâs radiometer and
Bordierâs radio-chronometer, the former in this country, and
the latter on the Continent. Hampsonâs instrument has
two disadvantages: it can only be used with electric light,
and the standards are made of tinted paper liable to get
soiled, and to vary slightly with the changes in the pigment
employed. Its advantage is that it may be used as a
sliding scale, thus economising the pastilles. Some
persons, however, have considerable difficulty in reading
the tints, the scale rising only by gradations of 1/4 B.

In the construction of any such instrument, the really
important point is to obtain a reliable standard for Tint
B—
i.e.
, the normal epilation dose. The tints on the
Sabouraud card itself are not always identical, some representing
a dose which will only just epilate, others an almost
dangerous dose for unfiltered rays. The Tint B, which is
the standard, allows a margin of error of 20 per cent. on
[84]

either side. In other words, 4/5 B will almost always epilate,
while 1-1/5 B is nearly the limit of safety. This observation
is in accordance with the experience of other workers on
this subject. In my instrument Tint B has been obtained
by measuring the pastille with Lovibondâs tintometer immediately
after exposure to the X-rays. The pastille was
turned to a tint corresponding to an epilation dose which
was known to be safe, as proved by clinical results. This
tint was measured directly both by daylight and by artificial
light from an 8-candle power carbon filament lamp with
frosted glass shade. I am indebted to Mr. Dean for suggesting
the use of Lovibondâs instrument for this purpose.

The methods employed in the experimental work have
been described in the
British Journal of Dermatology
for
August, 1913. By using a very constant focus tube and
averaging a large number of readings and correlating the
results with those obtained in clinical practice, we were able
to construct the curves indicating the colour developed by
the pastille. In these curves, shown in
Fig. 10
, the ordinates
are the Lovibond colour units, the abscissa the time during
which the current was actually passing. When using an
interrupter working at a constant speed, the actual time
was taken, otherwise the number of current interruptions
as measured by a dipper tachymeter was used.

As was to be expected, the daylight and electric light
curves were quite different. In each case the standard
yellow glasses employed were kept constant throughout the
curve, that for daylight being 15 units, that for electric
light 13 units. When these were combined with blue
and red glasses in varying units and fractions of a unit, they
gave a colour range which matched the pastille exactly in
the changes it undergoes from the unexposed condition to
the 2 B Tint.

[85]

The curves are plotted in accordance with Mr. Lovibondâs
practice—that is, not as a direct representation of the
standard glasses used, but as showing the colour sensation
received by the eye.

Fig. 10.

First, as to the daylight curve: In order to match the
unexposed pastille we interpose between the pastille and
the observerâs eye a yellow and a blue glass, plus a certain
amount of neutral tint (composed of three equal colour
units). Thus the colour sensation received is a yellow
green, together with a certain amount of white light. As
the pastille darkens under irradiation, both the green and
the white light disappear, until at a point just below the
1/2 B dose, there is no other colour present but yellow. After
this red glasses are required—
i.e.
, the colour sensation is a
yellow orange, which gradually deepens owing to an increase
in the proportion of red. The yellow curve thus rises till just
below the 1/2 B point, and then falls as the orange increases.

[86]

Next, as to the electric light curve. The unexposed pastille
has but a trace of green, which is soon lost. The orange
begins much earlier than in daylight, and thus at Tint B
has reached a higher point than in daylight. From this
point the orange and yellow parts of both curves run
practically parallel with one another up to 2 B. Beyond
2 B the readings become more difficult. I have not determined
the point when no more colour develops, as it has
no great practical value, though it might well be of interest
from a physico-chemical standpoint.

In my radiometer the standards are composed of the
Lovibond standard glasses in combination. The apparatus
itself consists of an optical instrument or viewing box.
This is divided by a central partition, so that on looking
through the eyepiece one sees a white background through
two small circular apertures. On one side, level with the
background, is a fitting to take the pastille in its holder.
On the other side is a groove in the instrument itself for
the insertion of the standard glasses. A similar groove is
fitted on the pastille side of the instrument to take neutral
tints if required. The colour of the pastille as seen by
reflected light can thus be compared with that obtained by
transmitted light through the standard glasses seen against
the white background. A difference of 1/5 B or 1 H is quite
easily perceivable.

It is usually of no great importance to obtain extremely
accurate measurement of the smaller fractions below 1/3 B.
Where this is necessary, neutral tints must be used when
working with daylight. With electric light these are unnecessary.
When required the neutral tints are interposed
between the pastille and the eye to absorb the white light
reflected from the pastille. The neutral glasses required
are 1Â·5 for the unexposed pastille, 0Â·6 for 1/4 B, and 0Â·2 for 1/3 B.
[87]

These values are subject to slight variations due to changes
in the varnish of the pastille emulsion. The difficulty can
always be avoided by using electric light, where a trace of
neutral tint is needed only when matching the unexposed
pastille—an unimportant point.

Method of Use.
—The choice of daylight or artificial light
is a personal matter, but one should practise reading the
scale with both. The use of the instrument shows that
the pastille fades very nearly as quickly under electric light
as it does under daylight. The following precautions should
be observed: In daylight work in a good white light, avoid
shadows and yellow light of any kind. With electric light
use an 8-candle power carbon-filament lamp with frosted
glass and a suitable white shade so arranged that the pastille
is 8 inches from the lamp. No other light should be
allowed to reach the pastille during examination. A
low power metal-filament lamp may be used, but greater
accuracy will be obtained with a carbon-filament lamp
which was used for the experimental work. The lamp
should be discarded as soon as the light becomes yellow
from prolonged use. Whether in daylight or electric light,
the examination must be rapid to avoid the fading of the
pastille. When it is desired to give an accurate 1 B dose,
it is better to put up the 4/5 B standard first. It is then
easy to calculate how much more exposure is required for
the extra 1/5 B. It is important to adjust the pastille carefully
so that none of the unirradiated green portion is visible
through the small aperture, as this will upset the reading.
In very accurate dosage new pastilles should be used, as a
bleached pastille never returns exactly to its original tint.
When such a bleached pastille is irradiated the colour
changes start a little farther down the curve, and thus the
tint for a given dose must be taken a little above the normal
[88]

tint. This increase is very slight, but is nevertheless quite
appreciable, and may amount to as much as 5 and 10 per
cent. Even then the margin for error is ample in the neighbourhood
of the B tint, and if a pastille is not used more
than three times, and is well bleached in daylight after each
exposure, no serious error is likely to occur. A standard
white background should always be used, and discarded
for a new one when it gets dirty. The colour standards
usually provided are those in common use—namely, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2,
4/5, 1, 1', and 2 B, but it is quite easy to make up standards
for any point on the curve. The symbol âB,â as the
erythema or epilation dose, has been retained, as it was
thought inadvisable to add to the number of such symbols
already existing.

To sum up:

1. The experimental work has determined the exact
colour changes occurring in the Sabouraud pastille when
exposed to X-rays.

2. These experiments have established a permanent standard
for Tint B, which matches the pastille exactly, does
not fade, is easily kept clean. These coloured glasses can be
readily and accurately reproduced, as they are standardized
spectroscopically by a firm who specialise in such work.
The standard will therefore remain constant so long as the
Sabouraud emulsion remains unaltered.

3. Glasses may be prepared of the correct tint for any
fraction or multiple of this dose up to 2 B or 10 H.

4. Either daylight or electric light can be used.

5. The optical instrument itself, by cutting off extraneous
light, greatly assists the colour comparisons, so that the
practical error need never exceed 10 per cent.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
